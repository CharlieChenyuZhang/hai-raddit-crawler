      "title": "Grown-ups of Reddit, in what ways have you seriously rehabilitated your character for the better?",
      "selftext": "Apologies for the arguably wordy way of phrasing the title question, but I wanted to hear some perspective, wisdom, etc., on ways in which you've seriously changed yourself *apart from* the obvious or more commonly touted sorts of reform (working out more often, beating addiction, etc.). We often pigeonhole ourselves and our character; we say things like, \"oh, I'm a math guy; I've never really exceled in writing,\" or, \"oh, I'm a night owl, so I'm next to useless in the morning.\" While sometimes these self descriptions are rooted in truths, I also feel that, at least in my case, such self descriptions are buffers or ego defenses; I know that change is needed, but I frame the matter as an issue of immutable character rather than changeable habits. I'm asking the topic question as a thirty-seven-year-old male who is currently working through two kinds of \"personal rehabilitation\" and may soon embark upon a third. I'll describe them, and then I'd really love to hear from all of you, whether it's sharing your own or remarking on what I've included here. Any guidance you can offer is also super appreciated.\n\n1. **\"I'm a night owl\"**: It's true that we don't all adhere to the same sleep schedule. I have friends my age that have little trouble being up and out of bed before 6:00 a.m., even in cases in which they aren't required, for work or otherwise, to be out of bed so early. I myself have often joked that, if I were made Emperor for Life, no one could reasonably expect you to be out of bed while the clock still said \"a.m.\" However, after struggling in my professional and personal life with depression and fatigue, I've made an effort to try and maintain a proper sleep hygiene. It's still early in the process, and I'm not always successful, but damn it if I'm not *already* noticing how much better life feels when I've not squandered most of the morning in bed. Go figure, Ben Franklin was onto something when he talked about how to be healthy, wealthy, and wise, right?\n2. **\"I'm a homebody\"**: I've been divorced for the last year or so. One of the major disconnects between my ex and me was that, while she loved to go out and live the night life, I enjoyed the quietness of home. Again, like being an early riser versus being a night owl, I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with preferring a loud or social night life versus enjoying quiet time at home. Rather, I feel that, in the past, I used \"being a homebody\" as an excuse to idle at home, not make or maintain connections with others, and generally not develop any new interests. Now that I'm no longer married or cohabitating with anyone, it's pretty much up to me whether or not I get out, and after struggling for a while, I've begun making myself go out more days than not. Sometimes for exercise, sometimes to sit in a coffee shop or bookstore, etc., but whatever the reason, I feel better for having gotten out.\n3. **\"I'm a gamer\"** (work in progress): Okay, I don't know that I've ever unironically said, \"I'm a gamer,\" but I wanted to adhere to the format I had for (1) and (2). I've played video games all my life. My literal first memory is playing *Super Mario Bros.* on my dad's NES. Video games were a form of escape and entertainment for me throughout childhood and, in particular, during a very tumultuous and occasionally abusive adolescence. My relationship with video games has always, I felt, bordered on addiction without quite reaching addiction. Call it \"high-functioning,\" perhaps; I played a lot of video games, but I always found time to get work and school done, even if it was sometimes a crunch or rushed job. But as someone who is working on self improvement, I can't help but wonder how much time would be freed up for other hobbies and pursuits if I didn't allow myself to lose so many hours to gaming. Whether mindlessly playing *Slay the Spire* or *Balatro* on my phone to committing serious time to games like *Age of Empires II* or *Civilization V*, gaming is a nontrivial time sink, and I feel like I would have more focus and be more well rounded as a person if I stopped pursuing the short-term dopamine hits of playing video games.\n\nApologies if this post is especially long-winded. I appreciate in advance you reading this post, and, again, I'd really love to hear your input and experiences. In what ways have you rehabilitated your own character, and what positive results have you reaped in the process?",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone,\nI’m turning 30 soon, and I’m really feeling the urge to move out of my hometown. I’ve been thinking about starting fresh somewhere new, but I’m struggling with what to do next career-wise.\nMy work history is… complicated. On paper, it looks like I’m a job hopper. I’ve worked across multiple industries including healthcare, tech, telecommunications, beauty, and higher education. The truth is, whenever I got a new offer with better pay, I took it. Then in 2022, I was working in tech and got laid off, and ever since then it’s been hard to get back into something stable. I’ve had a few “gap jobs” since, but nothing that feels like the right long-term fit.\nNow I’m at a crossroads. Part of me wants to take a leap and just move somewhere new, even without a job lined up. But another part of me thinks it would be smarter to find a job in another city first and let that determine where I go. The problem is, I feel like I’ve been rejected everywhere lately and don’t even know what roles to apply for anymore.\nHas anyone else been in this spot? How did you figure out whether to move first or find the job first? And how did you handle having a resume that looks all over the place?",

My family has been wanting me to go back for years now and I was chasing a dream abroad, a dream that crippled down two years ago due to this economy. I lost my job, apartment, and now grandmother. All within the span of two years. I went through two other traumatic events the past five years that I’d rather not talk about. Will I ever see light at the end of the tunnel? Is all the loss I’m facing my fault? Is it because of my decisions? \n\n\nI feel like this is my fault for being selfish and I feel very guilty. I always carried guilt about my family’s disapproval of my stay abroad for over 10 years and now, it’s much much worse. \n\nMy grandmother was a pure hearted, kind, and loving woman.

      "selftext": "Ok rude intro my fault but this has been getting me gray hairs. (This may he super long I tried to cut it). A bit of context: atm I'm(19F) living with my mother and brother until I leave for uni. But while I'm grinding, it's very hard to not go crazy and feeling like a second mom for my brother. My brother cannot cook, he barely cleans without cussing me out, he has no job and doesn't WANT a job, no education besides a diploma, no friends (actually serious, he talks to nobody), and no desire to leave. \n\nWith that, my mom and I both work and take college classes day in and day out just to pay for rent, bills, and food. Food is kinda scarce now becuz  my brother is a binge eater. If I dare to have anything in the fridge without a vegetable, especially takeout, it's gone overnight. Its to the point where I can't have cheese and bread in my house anymore becuz they will disappear in three days. \n\nWhats weird is that I was raised where I had to think for myself, act for myself, and get out the house as soon as I can. I was taught to cook and pushed to cook for the whole family a few nights, immediately got a job at 16, and my parents shoved the thought of college down my throat like I was at a glizzy eating contest ever since I was probably 12. I had a lot of pressure held onto me by BOTH of my parents at such a young age. So when I look to my older brother who can't cook without a microwave or use the laundry machine, Im confused. I'm pissed. And when I tell my mother that we need to teach him how to be independent, she either shrugs it off or just tells me that I have to teach him.\n\n I shouldnt have that responsibility of raising my 21 year old, grown ass brother AGAIN. One of my parents' excuses was that he has high-functioning autism, which I don't think is right to make an excuse for not teaching a child how to grow up. I could go on but I just wanna know what steps I can convince my mom to take or even I can take before I leave for uni. I have maybe abt 2 or 2 1/2 years of cc until then, but I really am worried for both my brother and mother. Without my job, my mother struggles a lot financially, and I mostly pay our gas, bills, and a bit of rent. If she still needs assistance I can't keep supporting her financially when i have to go to uni when theres another child right below her room. I just cant afford it.\n\n(Edited to make them coherent paragraphs my fault y'all) ",

The one many people praised and thought was going to be a president or some crap like that. So I grew up believing I was special, that I was different. \n\nI did not develop a working ethic. Then, College hit me like a train. I did not excel, only in theoretic classes but not in the practical ones. I hated the idea of having to deal with things I was not perfect from the start. Yet, I decied I had to change and developed a working ethic. I decided I wanted to become a nanotechnology engineer but was afraid I was not up to the task. \n\nSo I chose chemical engineer. Then, in third semester I had a class about science and got fascinated. I changed my degree to nanotechnology engineer. Yet I was not satisfied. I was intrigued by mathematics and that's where I began to practice writing proofs. It felt amazing there was an answer to my why's. I wanted to change career but my psychiatrist told me I was seeking scapism and he was to some extent right. (Just for your information, I have dealt with depressive episodes and OCD around topics of death, life and achademic excelence). I finished my degree with honors. \n\nI was proud and my family proud, yet deep down I knew I was not happy. A year later I got into my dream master, to study mathematics. It again hit me and feel like a failure (I don't have a degree in mathematics so it maybe was a hasty choice). Yet I did my best effort. However, it is not my first year and I ended up burnout with a feeling of dread. I based my whole personality around loving math and working with it, and now I feel like I can not enjoy it anymore, like there is no hope for me. I can not see myself with anything else. One possibility could be working as a programmer. \n\nIdk, I feel like a failure. My family supported me so much and gave me the best . Yet I feel like I made terrible choices like following a career in science. I only have the options of progressing with my master or leaving it and start working, but both options feel me with despair. I feel like a wasted potential, a disgrace to its family.",

The government bought to milk to maintain dairy prices.  I'm assuming the decision to make it into cheese was to extend the shelf life.  A huge amount of it was just stored until President Regan decided to distribute it to welfare ( not American farmers ) recipients.\n\n\nFat hitler's tariffs started a trade war with China who decided in retaliation to not buy American soy beans.  After destroying their market he is going to give American soy bean farmers a ( approximately ) $13 billion dollar bail out.  Though it is currently delayed by the government shut down to prevent 7% of the American population from having their health care premiums go up by about 7%, it is still coming.\n\nIt seems that in addition to cutting checks for agricultural welfare, it is likely that the government will buy up the soy beans too.\n\nGovernment tofu?\n\nI personally don't think so.  Tofu is perishable.  I think a better choice is \"Government TVP\".   TVP is Textured Vegetable Protein.  Called \"soya\" in Europe.  It is the byproduct of the soy bean oil industry.  Basically the fat ( oil ) is extracted from soy beans leaving all of the protein, calcium, and copious other nutrient as a byproduct.    The defatted soy beans are made into flour, then given a texture similar to meat.   Most Americans have probably already eaten it as \"meat extenders.\n\n\"Government TVP\".",

      "title": "There’s nothing wrong with having depth, so why does it feel like it’s working against me in dating?",
      "selftext": "I hope I don’t come across as tooting my horn. I’m genuinely wondering as I’ve been struggling with dating for six years. Yes, you heard that right – six whole years. Except for one man, I’ve never gone on more than three dates with the same person, and in total, I’ve probably been out with about six guys. I usually left first coffee dates feeling meh, but I’d still try to stay open-minded and initiating second ones, which always ended with the same realisation: we were incompatible, or the guy couldn’t care less.\n\nI even once posted my dating profile on this site for feedback. It’s been deleted, but I included photos of me paragliding (which I did only once, but nonetheless was a great experience), hiking and kayaking as I wanted to communicate my love for adventures and physical activities. Most people commented that it’s not about me, that dating is hard everywhere. But one comment has been stuck in my head ever since: \"The profile conveys high expectations, in my opinion, which is great. But some guys with a less interesting life and who are more conventional might feel too insecure to connect with you after checking it.\"\n\nThis reminds me of a guy I recently went on two dates with. He told me his hobbies were “being in nature” and “spending time with his daughter” (he’s divorced). But when I probed deeper – where he goes, what he does – he couldn’t really say. No mention of hiking, camping, anything. Meanwhile, I take my hobbies seriously. Exploring what I’m physically capable of and discovering new sides of myself through those experiences is my source of joy. I’m not saying I’m the deepest and most introspective person you’ll ever meet, but I’m curious and have a permanent hunger for understanding the different ways the world operate. I love digging into the “why” and “how” of things and can’t take much at face value. I’m also deeply interested in social issues that don’t personally affect me and fascinated by other cultures.\n\nSo on our second date, I asked perfectly normal questions, some of them included: “What’s your favourite city?” and “What have you learnt from doing your PhD in Early Childhood Education that someone like me wouldn’t have known?”, only to receive answers like “I don’t know” or “I can’t remember.” If anyone asked me those questions, I would have soooo much to say and maybe too excited to speak coherently. This is the guy who stayed silent when I told him I love people who make me question my own assumptions and see things I wouldn’t have considered on my own.\n\nIt honestly confused me because this guy had a PhD, which means he has intellectual depth. I believe everyone is shaped by a unique mix of childhood environments and experiences, which give each of us our own particular interests and depth. Whatever is the reason some people don't want to follow their natural curiosity doesn't matter, because my issue remains the same: I just don’t feel connected to people like that. And when you pair that with the comment saying my profile “conveys high expectations” and would scare off conventional men, it really got to me. I see myself as a completely ordinary woman who feels alive doing what she loves. If that intimidates men, then maybe it’s for the best. I don’t want to shrink myself to appeal to them. And if insecure men are all that’s left in the dating pool, maybe it’s time I learn to accept that I’ll be single for the rest of my life. That’s what I’m trying to tell myself but deep down, I feel depressed and resentful at how unfair it all seems. It seems easier for men to find partners who supports their ambitions, whilst women get punished for having deep emotional connection with her lives.",

While I hold deep concerns about her safety and well being, I am applying to medical school and its time consuming process. I just struggle with setting boundaries  because I feel guilty for not being able to help and for the most part she has been receptive. I really just feel anxious about leaving her at home when she has expressed that she isn't feeling well/sickly. What should I do? I've already signed her up for weekly visits with a volunteer organization and her children/grandchildren live nearby as well. ",

      "selftext": "\nI am 31 years old female. I've always heard that \"happiness comes from within,\" but honestly, after my recent breakup, I'm feeling more depressed and alone than I ever thought possible. Before I met my ex, I was in the same boat: lonely, pathetic, with this huge void inside that I just couldn't fill on my own. Now that they're gone, it's all come rushing back.\n\nThe thing is, I don't really have friends because my job requires me to move around a lot, and I'm not into those temporary, surface-level conversations that don't go anywhere. It doesn't give me any kind of dopamine boost or real connection. I'm **deeply introverted**. No matter how hard I try to leave the house, I feel drained and drawn back to my own space. Every day, I come home to an empty house, flip on the lights, do my chores, and that's it. Weekends are just boring stretches of nothing. I feel completely empty, like there's no joy or purpose without someone else in my life. Even though, I am an extremely charming and supportive family but I live thousands miles away from them.\n\n\n\nSo, I'm starting to wonder: Is it actually possible to be happy alone, or do we really need someone, a partner, maybe to bring that love, joy, and happiness into our lives? I'd love to hear from people who've been alone for a prolonged period after a breakup. How do you feel day-to-day? What do you do to bring happiness into your life? Any tips or stories would mean a lot.\n",

      "selftext": "Let me preface this by saying I’m not making fun of anyone’s SOs. I’m genuinely curious (and tbh, trying to be self-reflective). \n\nAnyway, I know two guys who run their own businesses but don’t know each other. Both share a trait that leaves me scratching my head. Whenever I meet guy 1, who is my friend, he launches into an endless rant about dishonest or underhanded industry practices: the scams, the shadiness, the corruption, etc. For context: we are based in South-east Asia, so business integrity is… let’s say, different from that in the developed part of the world. So scam, inconsistent quality of service, and dubious behaviours are par for the course. Still, every time I visit his office, he goes off for 30 minutes to an hour, rehashing the same stories or railing against things that actually don’t affect his business tangentially. By the end, I usually feel like I need a long nap to recover and wish I’d left earlier.\n\nGuy 2 is a friend's friend. We used to chat before he moved to another city to run his business. We don’t talk anymore, but I still see his social media posts. And boy, are they exhausting. He constantly goes on about his business philosophy, mission, and industry challenges, like he’s trying to prove something. It’d be fine if he offered real insights or a nuanced take, but instead, it’s just endless circular rambling that teaches me absolutely nothing about his field.\n\nBoth guys have partners, which makes me wonder: what it’s it like to be in a relationship with someone like that? Do their partners have to sit through the TED Talks every day? How do they not feel emotionally drained? Or does posting online serve as an emotional outlet so they don’t unload it on their partners? I have been single for 5 years and am starting to worry it might be because I don’t have the capacity to hold that much space for someone else’s negativity, the way their partners do.\n\n",

We stood up for each other with bigger kids, amused and consoled each other. It was really the only time in my life when I had that experience.\nRuminating on it, I'm struck by how what's at the core of Community isn't rancor or this constant need to dominate or control things by the few that the rest for whatever reason can't get a handle on.  \nWhen ther's that perfect balance, you're not dealing with Your differences as much as you're representative of the group's variations.\nLike it's the difference between being given a seat at the table and having helped construct it so you know you have as much of a right to be there as anyone else.\nToo often these days, one person's severe, say, food sensitivities become, for them, the source of everybody else's presumed limitations. I feel like that's become the way people with different challenges insist on a place at the table, now that we don't proverbially build them together any more.\n \nLike if they have food sensitivities, perhaps we all do, don't know it and they need to flip the script on the usual for the benefit of us all.\n\nIt just makes me sad for a future where more and more people will find themselves alone--because most will still crave that sense of real community many will never know.",

It's too easy to find yourself arguing with bots and getting incorrect information on platforms like reddit; I have no interest trying to sort through that.

      "title": "The Gospel of Cruelty: How MAGA Turned Faith into a Weapon",
      "selftext": "There’s a pattern repeating across the country, and it isn’t just political. It’s moral. What happened in Chicago and at Rutgers isn’t only about government power or campus politics. It’s about how empathy is disappearing while people still speak the language of virtue.\n\nIn South Shore, federal agents raided an apartment building in the middle of the night. Helicopters hovered above. Flash-bang grenades exploded in the dark. Doors were kicked in. Children were pulled from their beds half-dressed and zip-tied in front of their parents. Some of those parents were U.S. citizens. They asked for warrants, for explanations, for a lawyer. They got nothing. The people who were supposed to be protected by the law were treated like criminals.\n\nAfterward, there was silence. The same political voices that shout about liberty and tyranny when one of their own is arrested said nothing about this. No outrage for the children. No sympathy for the families. No defense of the Fourth Amendment they love to quote. The MAGA movement, which claims to stand for faith and freedom, simply turned its back.\n\nBut when a right-wing influencer was arrested in Portland after shoving a protester, the response was immediate. Conservative media filled the air with claims of persecution. Politicians rushed to his defense. The story dominated headlines, and donations poured in. The difference between those two reactions says everything. One story involved families terrorized in their homes. The other involved a man with a camera and a bruised ego. The moral outrage had nothing to do with justice and everything to do with loyalty.\n\nThat kind of selective empathy is performative. It’s faith used as camouflage. The same people who claim to follow the teachings of Jesus seem to forget what those teachings actually were. Feed the hungry. Welcome the stranger. Love your neighbor. Jesus never said, “Only if they vote like you.” He didn’t tell anyone to ignore suffering because it was politically inconvenient. The silence after the ICE raid wasn’t just hypocrisy. It was a spiritual collapse.\n\nThe same kind of collapse happened at Rutgers University. Students from Turning Point USA went after Professor Mark Bray, a historian who studies anti-fascism. They accused him of promoting violence, even though he never did. His crime was research. They claimed to feel unsafe, demanded he be fired, and flooded social media with lies. Within days, Bray was getting death threats. He had to leave the country. The people who claimed to be victims of “Antifa violence” became the source of real violence themselves.\n\nThis isn’t an accident. It’s a pattern. It’s what happens when victimhood becomes a weapon. Turning Point students pretended to be under attack, just as MAGA leaders pretend that their movement is being persecuted, even as it uses power to intimidate and harm others. It’s a kind of emotional theater that turns cruelty into courage. The same pattern drives political violence. According to the Cato Institute, right-wing extremists have been responsible for the majority of politically motivated killings in the United States for decades. Yet they continue to claim they’re the ones in danger.\n\nThat inversion reveals something deeper than hypocrisy. It shows a movement that has replaced empathy with domination. The words are still there: freedom, faith, family, values, but the meaning is gone. What remains is branding, a language of morality used to sell power. Their outrage isn’t moral conviction. It’s a performance staged to win elections and silence opposition.\n\nBoth the raid in Chicago and the campaign against Professor Bray expose that truth. The MAGA version of morality isn’t about protecting anyone. It’s about control. It uses fear to justify harm and calls that righteousness. It borrows the name of Jesus but none of his compassion. He stood with the poor, the sick, and the outcast. He condemned those who used faith as a mask for cruelty.\n\nIf the people who claim his name can watch children zip-tied in their homes and say nothing, if they can threaten a teacher for doing his job and call it justice, then what they’re preaching isn’t Christianity. It’s idolatry. A worship of power dressed up as virtue. And like all false gods, it demands sacrifice: of truth, of empathy, and of the very soul of the country.",

Thirty-seven people are detained - including U.S. citizens. Children are zip-tied and separated from their parents. No warrants. No accountability. And days later, silence from the same institutions that claim to stand for “law and order.”\n\nEqual protection under the law isn’t a partisan luxury. It’s the foundation of the Fourteenth Amendment - the promise that the same laws apply to all people, regardless of politics, background, or zip code.\n\nWhen the government enforces laws unevenly, it doesn’t just expose bias - it erodes legitimacy. Selective enforcement doesn’t strengthen a nation; it hollows it out from within.\n\nWe don’t need new slogans. We need consistency.

Some U.S. citizens were detained for hours.\n\nThe justification for this blatantly illegal and unconstitutional assault is a familiar one. The regime claims it was going after drug traffickers and gang members.\n\nBut once again, it offered no proof. We just have to take their word for it. Authorities seized people first, without probable cause, treating merely living in the same complex as suspected undocumented migrants as a crime.\"\n\nDo you see this in the news *anywhere*???\n\nThis information comes from Jay Kuo, The Status Kuo.\n\n",

And honestly, I wish someone had told me about this sooner but I'm sharing my experience\n\nWhen I booked my first session, I was skeptical. But whatever, why not. \n\nSession 1\nMostly felt like a early flush. The water would go in, a release would happen nothing too dramatic. Grossed out by what's coming out but not too concerned.  I walked out feeling lighter. \n\nSession 2 the following week\nThings start to shift. More came out, darker, heavier. Now she's massaging my stomach with a massage gun. She's getting some things out, gas included.  I remember thinking, How long has this been sitting inside me? Gross! My stomach felt less tight, and I actually had more energy that week.\n\nSession 3 two weeks later\nThis was the \"breakthrough.\" holy shit literally! By now my body is getting comfortable taking in more water. It can go up even further. For picture sake, the colon is about 6ft tall and the small intestine about 30ft. Food has a long way to go before it makes it out... Anyway  within the first release, I felt something literally dislodge inside me Not exaggerating, i couldn't believe that was in my stomach this whole time. It was gross, disgusting and there's no amount of cleanse or bathroom trips that would have helped. Yes you can see all the crap come out thru the machine. The relief is very different after 3 sessions. My belly felt flatter, my mood lighter. I walked out of that session feeling like a new person.\n\nIt hit me that I had been carrying old waste. Physically, i feel 200 times better today than i did yesterday or 4 weeks ago. \n\nI'm breathing better. To put into context I'm 5'6 female 165 lbs. Im not \"big\" by any means. I have stubborn belly fat but that's about it. Now I’m mad this isn’t talked about more. We do so much “preventive care” that doesnt focus on our actual gut health. Sometimes it's just shit in the stomach and nothing else. colon hydrotherapy gets dismissed but I can tell you, it works. \n \n\n If you’re struggling with bloating, fatigue, or that stubborn belly that won’t budge, this might be worth looking into. It cost me 100 dollars a session and it helps to do your research on the person doing it. \n\n--- hope this helps.\n",

      "selftext": "Edit: I've already gotten some thoughtful comments and I'll respond to them soon. I'm thinking \"mentor\" is not the right word--maybe even just \"role model\". There's not a lot of people I can look to and say \"I want to grow up to be just like them\"\n\nOriginal:\n\nBoy I didn't realize how messed up I was until recently. TL;DR: mid 30s M, socially isolated by parents to the point where I had no idea it wasn't normal. I make good money but I never moved out and have never dated. I have a few IRL friendships but I rarely see them because of geographic isolation. Now I have an aging, entangled parent I'm trying to get away from to build my own independent life, before I have to deal with the responsibility of elder care. I have no other family.\n\nAll my father figures are dead (not by me) or politically incompatible with my values. Most of the people I know my age are either also not doing well themselves or are maried with kids, and the latter is not a future I see for myself. I'm trying to figure out my sexuality at the same time--probably asexual, see further down--and it's the sort of thing that I absolutely cannot bring up with older people around me, much less expect them to understand. To put it into perspective, people have literally been shot over pride flags in the type of small town I live in.\n\nWhere do I start untangling this mess?\n\nI'm thinking moving out is the #1 priority, and wheels are in motion for that. It'll give me room to breathe and figure things out. But I've never lived on my own and I don't have many people I can lean on IRL for advice. I know a few things: buy a plunger before I need it, check out places to live in the afternoon when you can hear how many loud families are nearby, get a slow cooker. But it's all so *abstract*.\n\nNot to bury the lede, but I think I also fucked up future relationships by getting involved with the furry fandom at a young age. I ended up making furry kink art as a hobby because the fandom gives you lots of praise and attention for doing that and I gravitated towards that. But at the same time, I'm not comfortable with the fandom. I haven't figured out if the art made me asexual or if I was just born that way. I do remember wondering what the fuss was about girls when I was a teen, and I don't seem to care much for dudes either, so I'm starting to think I'm just fundamentally broken here, which is massively depressing to me as I know it makes dating more difficult. One problem at a time, I guess.",

      "selftext": "When I was 18, I was studying for my high school final exams in a cellar, that was nice and cozy, quiet and perfect for studying uninterrupted. But there were these 3 parrots that belonged to my neighbor, he put them there for winter, so that they can be in a warm place without having them at home actually. When I was at that age, I wasn't exactly an animal person, but I was able to tolerate those parrots, as they were surprisingly quiet. But once I got bored from several hours of studying, while also being severly unmotivated and frustrated, I tried playing with those parrots, but they were easily scared and not too friendly. So I wanted to at least try feeding them through their cage, and that was also impossible. Something didn't sit well with me, maybe the fact that they didn't wanna interact with me at all, not even when offered food and then I tried these small, yet for them surely terrifying, actions that were meant to humor me. I took a wooden stick and tried to touch them with it, after several days it got to me trying to squish them a little bit with that stick, while also spraying water at them. I once squished that poor little thing so hard it actually screeched, but I'm sure I didn't harm them seriously. Then it kept producing these sad, yet slow howls and I began to worry a bit that I harmed them seriously. \n\nDuring following 7 years up until now, I matured and grew up not only physically, but also mentally and spiritually and over that period of time with me maturing, I fell in love with animals, almost every single animal you can find and see, I would love them unconditionally and never harm them (except for defending myself from an aggressive one) and I regret harming that poor parrot to this day. Yesterday I teared a bit when I recalled the sound it made after being squished a bit harder. The parrot has been dead for a while (not my doing at all, it actually lived another 3 year I think) and I seriously hope that little fellow has forgiven me, as I have not been able to forgive myself at all for that. My parent are kind people, never saw them hurt animals, they even taught me to never harm them at all, me myself, I am also a kind person, not aggressive at all, my heart belongs to people around me, always trying to help others, that's why I don't understand my behavior that day... and I'm actually sorry.

      "selftext": "I (27F) dated a guy (37M) a while ago (last year) for about 3-4 months. We then broke up, for both me doing something wrong and him being in a not stable situation overall. So the relationship ended. We never unfollowed each other on social media (Instagram + threads). I was first hoping for him to get back to me, but then I moved on, went to therapy, healed totally from that relationship, and I'm now dating other people. He has definitely noticed me moving on, since I no more interact with his posts or even watch his stories. So once in a while, he comments on one of my posts, and here is where I'm mostly debating. Because I honestly have no more feelings for him and I won't for sure get back to him. But at the same time my account is public and I don't want others to realize there is something between us, by me being intentionally ignorant on his comments. I'm also afraid if he DMs me. I just want him to move on and don't contact me. That's all. But he's just spiraling around yet.\n\nSo, what do you think is the most mature thing to do in here? ",

But since then, my body rejects alcohol irrespective of the quantity or type. Regardless of how much food I’ve eaten, or other factors such as sleep etc. \n\nmost recently, I had 4 pints of lager on a night out, came home sober and woke up at 6am the next morning and vomited for 17 hours straight after which was definitely the most severe reaction I’ve had. The usual version for me is 3-4 drinks, wake up at 6am and the vomit until about mid day/early afternoon. \n\nI was curious if anyone else had any similar experience with this kind of thing? I’m fine without drinking when I see people and hang out, I’m very confident in any setting and don’t rely on it at all. It would just be nice to know that I could have 2-3 drinks without my body completely shutting down for the next day, or having that anxiety loom over me. ",

      "selftext": ">\n\nHello,\n\nI wanted to ask you all since I'm embarrassed to ask my long term partner. My partner has ADD and I've helped him with his impulse control and emotional dysregulation issues. I just want to ask people who might understand my current problem and it's not new to you?\n\nI dont have ADD but I have PTSD w/ Obsessive Anxiety ( doc said it was not OCD, just a particular anxiety stress reliever).\n\nMy current issue is I've been on medicine for a year and everything is good. All my levels are typical emotionally & mentally consistent and since I've had ptsd from a young age (unknown at the time).. I am not use to feeling okay?\n\nI'm use to being depressed and not buying anything and nothing giving me joy or making me happy. I'm 34. I've been use to this style of living until last year. When I mean depressed, I mean 2 years in a row I did not spend money beyond bills & gas and racked up around15,000$ from a 32k job.\n\nNow that I've gotten better & respond well to medicine... I spent 5k on clothes last year and I'm STILL spending money on clothes & craft kits. All the excess money is gone from clothes, shoes, crafts, social events ... and I just... ?\n\nI'm use to being poor, grew up poor (no central air&heat or hot water), I'm use to not having anything and then being too sad to purchase *when I did have money*, so being on this medicine, sleeping well and feeling good/decent/awake?? kind of sober?? I'm buying things I do not need. I'm starting to collect paypal-loan payments. This is when you pay something off over 4 payments in 2 months.\n\nI want to cry, ugh. All I can think of doing is disconnect my card from online purchases (it's saved in memory/cookies) and I should not visit certain sites maybe get a website blocker?\n\nWhat do you do? What is something you do?\n\nDo you know of other places I should ask? I don't know which other subreddits to ask for advice, maybe [r/adulting](https://www.reddit.com/r/adulting/)? I moderate the PTSD sub and I know they probably wont be in the headspace to give suggestions.\n\nlet me know your thoughts, please 😞",

      "selftext": "Once upon a time I was an only child. Mom and dad split up. I Received 4 brothers with an additional brother older than me that nobody knew about from him. My mother gave 2 sisters and 1 other brother.\n\nMy family is torn up from the floor up. All my siblings are halves and my mom chooses to treat us (M41) like we are tiny children. She makes threats she knows she can't cash and she hates being wrong. It just kills her to the degree that she will find a way to be right. BTW it's my house.\n\nMy mother and sister just finished a brutal battle. She can be mean, so can my sister. and my mothers sister. This crap needed a windows printing queue if you catch my drift. It was fight after fight. My mother want's her here and she honestly needs that additional income. So it boggles my mind when I see her shoeing them away. My own other sister from 3 hours away chose not to stay here because she knows things will go down.\n\nI offered up steak and more. I was representing. Well, last night a group of great people had a tailgate party and me and my sister attended because they are mutual friends. There was boos and such. Keep in mind the sister who attended was only 6 years younger than me. So we are both grown ass adults.\n\nI'm not going to lie, I have watched my mom be abused, and that was the theme for the night. My sister is very much into somebody. And yea... I get that because thoughts have entered my mind with my step dad. But she has never received harm from this man according to her. I have never seen any marks or bruises. etc... In fact my sister will not tolerate it after seeing what we have.\n\nMy mom is a post traumatic survivor. So I get it. But she is on a kick that I can't put in words. I love her dearly and we have a pretty good relationship. But she does go off deep and treats us all like we are less than a teen. I have had to point it out and straiten it out. My mother can be colder than ICE. I know she means well. But she is crazy sometimes at 60.\n\nAfter 5 battles, my sister left. Rent isn't cheap and I'm pretty sure she will be back. The sister from out of town might just be \"out of town\" because of the drama. Hell I don't blame her. The other one will come back likely. Me and her have a great understanding of our mom. The craziest thing is that she is so confrontational and claims to hate such activity.\n\nI had to run down stairs and tell her to shut up if she is \"done\" and \"doesn't care\" because I use those words with respect and honestly. My sister did nothing wrong. My mother has called the cops so that she could be retrieved without knowing how intrusive she can be. My sister has one leg. She keeps it very simple. My mom has walked in on me doing things I wish I never had to. She cares. But she oversteps her boundaries.\n\nShe also plays victim right away, and she has been one. I get it. The wording she uses is like a special shield to protect her while blaming anything on anyone no matter who it is around her. And she projects.\n\nQuestion: What should I say to lighten the load. Because this is getting out of hand. She is practically forcing everyone she loves away, friends and family. It scares me. You would think I had a plan after being with a Psych doc for 15 years but I don't.",

      "selftext": "At the risk of sounding unbearably “get off my lawn,” I think some problems with our current discourse is that young people can’t seem to recognize a legitimate threat that needs response vs something they could just as easily brush off. \n\nOn my local sub today, some young woman posted a picture of somebody’s truck with a title like, “Watch out for this creep.” She went on to say what this creepy person did: drive a little slow, and smiled and waved at her when she looked at him. \n\nI replied to her with something like, ok I get it isn’t optimal getting unwanted attention but what made you feel like this behavior warranted a warning post? For reference, I’m a trans woman and mentioned that I’ve had to learn to ignore unwanted attention. It’s just part of life and this young person could do with a slightly thicker skin. \n\nThen, interestingly, somebody commented on my comment saying, “this is what the world is now. Being nice to a girl gets you put in jail” or something like that. Like… what?? \n\nTo me, both of these responses demonstrate an outsized reaction to perceived yet nonexistent threats. It’s like everybody lives such sheltered lives they don’t understand what to save their outrage for because they may have never actually encountered a real threat. Instead, they direct it at each other in these childish ways. “Boys vs girls” being a big one. \n\nI actually think this is by design. We are facing real threats that the powers that be (capitalism) want us to ignore. The young woman could direct this outrage toward the literal Nazi takeover that’s happening and the stripping away of rights like roe v wade. The young man could look around at his friends and be outraged at the mental health, education, and drug crises affecting men and boys. Or, even better, they could both be outraged at both of those things. \n\nThey could work on these issues hand in hand as partners. But they both lack empathy toward the “other” and create these perceived injustices. Is it because that’s easier than taking on the big issues?",

We're at that stage where we're getting to the big firsts of independence. \n\nYesterday, Kiddo wanted to bike home alone for the first time after the teacher meeting at school. It's not a long bike ride, about a kilometer (less than a mile), but it is a busy road with lots of freight trucks and there's no separate bike path. I reluctantly said yes, and watched my baby cycle off towards home. Kiddo reached home safely and was so very proud of herself! She even stored her bike correctly without anyone saying to do so. As a reward, tomorrow we're going to practice Kiddo biking alone to her daycare after school. If it goes well a couple of times, she'll be allowed to bike from school to daycare after school lets out. She's really excited about that.\n\nThe moments kept coming last night - it was Kiddo's first turn cooking dinner for the family (with guidance, of course!). Kiddo has always puttered around with us in the kitchen, \"helping\" until boredom set in and her toys exerted their siren songs. But last night Kiddo stayed with me in the kitchen and made most of the elements of last night's dinner: tacos!\n\nI love the symmetry of it all - tacos (the crunchy Tex-Mex tacos) were also the first dish my two sibs and I cooked when it was our turn to start cooking dinners once a week. \n\nI also love the fact that my kid is ready for more responsibilities and is eager to do them. We've always given her age-appropriate chores around the house (clean up toys, put shoes in the hallway, unpack backpack, clean up plate/cup after eating, put dirty clothes in the basket, etc.), and lately we've been expecting more out of her, especially in the mornings doing the routine things without us having to prod her every 2 minutes (because SQUIRREL).   \n  \nTo see her responding so positively to her accomplishments and our encouragement, and her eagerness to take on more responsibility within the family helps me feel like I'm doing something right as a parent. It also helps ease the sting of realizing my baby, my schaatje,  the best thing in my life, is growing up. \n\n",

I love where I live now: I have a strong social life, I have a lovely apartment in a great part of town, I am truly fulfilled, but when I think of my mom my heart aches at the idea that I'm missing the last good years, even though I call her every day. Moving back to my hometown would be great in some respects (lower cost of living, convenience of a car, I still have lots of friends there) but horrible in others (political environment, access to anything worth doing, having to drive constantly). I know this is a decision I have to make myself, but has anyone else experienced this? I would love to hear your thoughts. Thank you!",

How do you just let go of the little annoying habits and things they do? How do you not get bored of them or feel bogged down by the heaviness that relationships can often bring? \n\nNot sure if I’m seeking advice, looking for some obscure conflict resolution trick or just curious to know your story. Hopefully I don’t just get alot of cliche comments like “communication is key”…. \n\nP.S. I’m talking about people who have been together for 10+ years.

To study with friends on a academic mystery in a old dusty library. To stroll the university commons in the morning mist on the same ground scholars walked over a hundred years ago. To discuss philosophy and perform experiments with professors in a timeless setting. To attend intense lectures about amazing and informative topics.\nI live this dream vicariously by watching university tours online, reading student life articles, Google Earth street views of the university, and even sometimes pretending to fill out an admittance application. I know that I will never attend an ivy league due to my past grades, finances, and busy work/family life. \n\nThough I still wonder, what if.",

I don't like that, and she's probably not going to do it. But it gave me an opportunity to tell her that I really don't care for Nicolas, which unfortunately hurt her feelings because she put a lot of thought into Nicolas.

      "title": "Should I move from western Canada to the United States after graduating for work?",
      "selftext": "Some background information: I'm a 33-year old male in Edmonton, Alberta, I have a previous degree in Education but went back to school for accounting in 2024. I currently live with my parents. I should be graduated at the end of December 2026. I currently have a lot of debt (a car payment, student loan debt, some credit card debt).\n\nMy twenties were spent with a lot of mental health issues due to my bipolar and general immaturity and so I wasn't able to get a career off the ground. I started dating someone recently, but it's not serious yet.\n\nThere is a TN visa that is extremely easy to get at the US border that allows accountants to move to the US for up to 3 years at a time if they can secure a job. The problem is that unemployment is really high where I am and Junior Accountant jobs here seem to pay 45-50k CAD, while the US pays much higher starting salaries for accountants. I'm seeing junior accountant jobs for 55-65k US, which is closer to 76k to 90k CAD. That's closer to the senior/management level in Canada.\n\nThere's a lot of geopolitical and cultural reasons why the wage for accountants is so much higher in the US. The comparison of Canada to the US on r/accounting shows this fact regularly.\n\nRegardless, if I could secure a higher paying US job, I could pay down my debts so much faster and actually save up some savings for the first time in my life. I could even bounce around and move up to a staff accountant job after a year or two, potentially making $75k USD which is $103k CAD. Also getting more experience would help me find a job in Canada if I came back here.\n\nOf course, despite all of the benefits, I'm hesitant about moving. I've never been away from my parents or brother ever, and my parents are getting older. Edmonton is my home and I derive a lot of comfort from being here, going to movies or walks with my brother, spending time with my parents and hanging out with friends. I also find the idea of all of the hassle of moving to be daunting: getting a new driver's license, securing my medication which is vital, finding a place to live, etc.\n\nI guess in the modern world you can keep in touch with people over video calls. I could video call my parents and brother a couple times a week and keep touch over messaging. I have a friend in Russia I talk to every week and I feel close to him even though he's on the other side of the world. Also, moving somewhere else might be a growing experience and get me out of my comfort zone.\n\nSo, this is a new development in my thinking, but I'd like to hear some thoughts about whether I should consider this further or maybe I'd regret moving away from my family and friends chasing after higher pay and more secure employment.",

Redditors overreacted with many negative comments, though many of them were natural.  Just stating the facts about Kirk's life.  Reddit also overreacted with the censorship of people who wanted to make those natural comments.  The most hilarious example I saw was the mods of /r/politics labeling articles about the assassination as not being about \"US Politics\".\n\nLastly there were/are the finger waggers on Reddit trying to shame people about their thoughts over Kirk's death.   Some were even complaining that they were getting flamed for it.  In the year 2025 it is kind of naive to ***try*** to tell someone on social media how to speak and what they can say and not expect a negative response.",

      "selftext": "Obviously the title is poorly worded, and nobody can decide for someone else what career choices they should or shouldn’t make. I guess I just need some perspective, as I am new to the corporate world.\n\nI am 37 years old, and I am 3 years into my second career. I was an ICU nurse before, got super burned out during Covid and decided to pursue software engineering. I did a programming bootcamp and was hired out of that at a major American corporation doing IT work. DevOps, front end development, etc.\n\nI’ve been in this job over three years now, and I still have “associate” in my title. My manager has put me up for promotion twice (I guess her superiors need to approve that), but I have been denied both times. Next promotion cycle isn’t until next year, so that would be 4 years in an entry level job.\n\nIs that “normal”? Coming from healthcare, I don’t know anything about the corporate world. I don’t know if I am being taken advantage of or if this is just how it works being a cog in the corporate machine.",

I didn’t realize and didn’t see the signs. I was going through my own demons and kept pushing him away bc of insecurities and fears; was inconsistent with him; wasn’t intentionally doing it, was leading with feelings and it was my first adult, intentional relationship, so I acted ignorantly immature and was blinded how my actions confused and hurt him; affected him. He understandably got tired of it said he’s done. \n\nI then realized who I lost and reached out to him a lot through the phone. I finally realized he wasn’t answering so I accepted it. He then reached out two weeks ago saying he’s willing to talk, but can’t have drama and inconsistency and needs someone intentional in a relationship. \n\nHe invited me to his house and we talked-mainly I talked about my behavior and why I behaved like I did and the new things I’ve been working on changing to not be like I was. He understood, said let’s take it slow, no gaslighting and said thank you, bc I was apologizing for how I treated him. He asked me if I wanted to stay for dinner and then he initiated sex. \n\nThen the rest of the week, I text him first wanting to hang out and he kept saying he was busy and tired. We did hang out 3x in that first week/weekend but we only did things he wanted to do at his house. Within those times, he initiated sex ; it wasn’t a lovingly I’ve missed and cared about you sex, more of a fuck you like a porn star sex; I felt I was being used, but I understood, he probably felt used too during our first 3 months when meeting each other. We also went out in public one other time. \n\nHe’s putting no effort or interest in anymore, compared to when I first met him and now I’m on the side of pursuing. I don’t mind it bc I like him and want to make a life w him. I get guys get tired of pursuing if not reciprocated and efforts are not being appreciated. And bc I was distant and hard to form a relationship with, I need to build up his trust and security again to see if I am a person to invest in. I get it. But idk how long I can keep this up and if I need to give him 3 months and then cut my losses like he did with me? It’s like liking a wall. \n\nAnd do you think he’s being cautious and protecting himself emotionally? Or you think he’s using me bc I’m available and easy? ",

      "selftext": "I’m making this post for my friend who doesn’t have a Reddit but I’ll be acting as his liaison to communicate his replies and such lol. Here’s what he would like to post:\n\n*I want nothing more in this life than to be a devoted father and loving husband. I am extremely jealous of colleagues younger than me who have already found their person. I’m a single 35 1/2 year old man who has only had one long term relationship, about 7 years ago. She was extremely toxic (BPD-like tendencies) and fucked me up at the time. I’m very close to my parents, whom are still together and happy, and wish I could give them grandchildren.\n\nEver since then, I have not really sustained relationships because I don’t feel that initial spark in the beginning. Well - I do. But always always always that spark fades within 1-2 weeks tops. And then I completely lose interest. \n\nThere was a girl around 3-4 years ago that I had a short fling with. She wanted to make things official, and I ended up breaking things off because work was really stressing me at the time. At the time I felt certain about my decision, it’s only in hindsight that I have ever thought of her and a few others throughout the years. \n\nIn short: Since my toxic ex from many years ago, my “honeymoon phase” has never lasted longer than a week or two. And I’ve been on many, many dates since then with an open mind. Some are not into me, some I’m not into, but the ones where there’s mutual attraction is where this pattern occurs. I guess I feel like this “honeymoon phase” should last way longer than it does/has, and idk why it disappears so quickly - even when I’ve really liked the girl upfront and made her my girlfriend (my most recent ex). I think there has to be a valid honeymoon phase for there to be a connection worth standing for. \n\nWhy am I unable to find or sustain what I’m looking for, even when I think I’ve finally found it? I don’t want to be 40 years old, still alone, asking myself this same question.\n\nHas anyone else struggled with this? If so how did you address and fix it, or have I simply not met the one yet?*",

      "title": "Long-term friend removed me from our group chat and now we haven’t spoken in weeks — what should I do?",
      "selftext": "I’m a 28-year-old male, autistic with learning difficulties. My friend (also 28, with ADHD) and I have known each other for over 10 years.\n\nAbout a month ago we had a falling out. I sent him some music news, he read it but didn’t reply, and about an hour later he removed me from our Messenger group chat (me, him, his fiancée, another friend, another friend, and his fiancée). Out of the blue he just removed me, and instantly messaged me after saying:\n\n“Don’t take the removal of the group chat personally, there’s stuff going on with one of the couples in the chat so I thought it would be easier on them to just delete the chat”\n\n“Similar thing with the insta chat, there’s a lot going on and I’m not at liberty to say, I just think we all need to take a break from group chats as it’s getting a bit much for someone”\n\nBut because I could still see the group (just couldn’t message or see new posts), it seemed like it hadn’t been deleted—it was still active, just without me. I ignored it because I didn’t know what to say, then went on holiday to Croatia the next morning.\n\nA couple of days later he sent me a meme and then:\n\n“you good?”\n\nI hadn’t told him I was away, I had bad signal, and I wasn’t on my phone much, so I didn’t reply. A few days later he messaged again:\n\n“Hey dude, are we good? Its okay if not just much rather you tell me init”\n\nI eventually replied:\n\n“Jake, I want to be clear about something. I saw you removed me from the group and Insta chats, and I’d have appreciated honesty rather than vague explanations tbh. When you said you deleted the group I could still clearly see it was active, which makes it feel like I’m being pushed out or that I’m not wanted like maybe you don’t actually want me in your life. I’m not looking to argue, I’m really not I just want a straight answer about whether you actually want me in your life or not. If not, that’s fine, we can leave it there”\n\nHe replied:\n\n“Okay, first of all. Great use of AI which is fine because I know you’re not one for being able to talk about things that are deep 😂\n\nSecond of all, there was genuine unrest with someone in the group (not gonna say who because of privacy) because of personal issues and they said the constant messaging and memes being sent from EVERYONE in the chat was getting a bit much so I genuinely have removed myself and other people have from that chat as well to give them space.\n\nClearly still want you as a mate because you’re still in the tiny meat gang chat on messenger as well lad. (Tiny meat gang, yes weird name is a group chat with just the boys in it that is kinda dying since he made the group with the fiancés in it a while back)\n\nAnd the reality is that the couples of the group (myself, Jenna, Matt and Ale especially) will just want to hangout just us guys because we’re all helping each other plan each others weddings so if we’re hanging out and you’re not getting invited it’s because we are more than likely needing to focus on wedding preparations.\n\nYou know me, if it’s something that you have personally done I will always make sure you’re aware of it, we’ve known each other for well over a decade now and you know that I will tell you straight up if you have done something wrong”\n\nI didn’t reply properly after that—I was still abroad with bad signal, then had migraines when I got home. Now it’s been about 3 weeks and neither of us has messaged.\n\nFor extra context: back in April he sent me this about his wedding:\n\n“Hi mate, we’ve had to cut some of the budget for our wedding so we’ve had to make a shorter guest list so we won’t be able to invite you anymore, I’d much rather tell you straight up then you find out by not receiving an invite when we send them out, sorry again mate”\n\nI replied:\n\n“No worries at all mate,honestly.\nAppreciate you letting me know. hope everything goes great for you both!”\n\nAnd he said:\n\n“Cheers mate, appreciate it. If it makes you feel any better some of Jenna’s friends, my cousins and Tom has been cut”\n\nBut later I found out that a friend of about 4 years is invited, and even a work friend of just 6 months “got close” and is going.\n\nSo now I don’t know what to do. Part of me feels bad for not reaching out, but I don’t know if I should try to sort it out, leave it, or how I’d even go about it.\n\nWhat do you think?",

      "title": "Do I leave my bf who came to my parents wedding this weekend, and now is back in contact with the girl he “broke” contact with 3 days ago?",
      "selftext": "\nOkay, so basically my boyfriend had been in the mental ward for two months and he had also been in psychosis twice in those weeks. \nHe broke up with me many times because of our big arguments in those weeks and then as a gap filler he was with this other girl. He was also under benzos the whole time during his psych ward- stay. That girl kept visiting him there although I told her he is my boyfriend.\n\nThis weekend was the wedding and I told my BF that he can't come to the wedding because he's uninvited. He ignored that completely and came to my village to convince me to talk to my parents so that he's invited back again. We had a long discussion at the train station where he also called this girl because I was discussing with him about this girl as well. Just on thursday she gave him back his things (a hoodie and 15 euros no one doesn’t really need) to which after I decided that he can’t come to the wedding but didn’t tell him. \nWhen we were sitting at the café on friday the next day after she gave the things back, I tried to explain to him that it's disrespectful for me, he didn’t show any agreement. And I tried to tell him that she thinks that she can have him and he's not really showing clear boundaries and says they can have a friendship. Although he knows that it's pissing me off. My dad invited him to the wedding and it was going fine until yesterday evening. I saw that they followed each other back on Instagram. I texted him that it's not okay. \n\nToday morning he said to me “how can you think I’m willing to cheat on you after seeing your parents again” and “that I can't leave him now”. When I tell him that whole thing is disrespectful to me, him being in contact with her, he doesn't understand it. I'm literally fuming right now and I told him it's a clown show that they are doing on me. And I don't really know how to behave. Last week I told him to text her that “they won’t see each other ever again”, and now we are back to the same problem as before..\n\nThis girl thinks my bf is her future husband from just 4 weeks of knowing each other between them. She studies psychology and has a therapy certificate so she should know that he was incapable of feeling normally during his mental ward stay because of the medications, but apparently she doesn’t and my bf also doesn’t see any fault or take accountability for her behaviour.\nYesterday he said he wants to pick me up from work everyday this week. How can he say that and be in contact with a girl he knows is in love with him?\n\nI already blocked both of them on instagram. I’m just wondering how to proceed now? \n\n\nTLDR: My bf was in the mental ward twice the past months, where he let a girl visit him that didn’t listen to my messages on telling her that he is my boyfriend. Every week it’s almost the same drama, she still thinks that he is her “husband” after only 4 weeks of knowing each other. She kept messaging him and he kept answering. Yesterday they refollowed each other on instagram and I told him its not okay. Idk what to do",

And if you have his kids and still lack self-knowledge, it's easier for him to walk away and leave you doing the whole thing alone. \n\nI grew up in dysfunction but understand not all of us did. So for those that didn't, what was it like to have love from males--say from your teens onward--that didn't automatically have a sexual component?\nDid it give you the tools to make better relationship decisions later on? What tips would you give other black women like me about cultivating non-sexual connections with men?\n\nJust for the record, the mods over on the Black Ladies sub seem to have it in for me. However, I think this is an important issue. If you have thoughts and are not a black woman--and they're not about black women in particular--feel free to sare your two cents. ",

I’ve lost touch with many friends and still trying to find myself/identity. \n\nFor the past year, I’ve been so fixated on my appearance and preoccupied by fighting this monster, I had nothing else going on in my life. I’ve lost my hobbies and passion for many things along the way. \n\nNow that my anxiety meds have helped me mentally, I really want to reconnect and rebuild myself. I also want to build a solid new identity so BDD does not haunt me again. \n\nHowever it’s been tough/awkward and I’d find myself very slow in reacting while the old me felt quite comfortable in social situations. I feel like a shell with no personality when hanging out with people now. There’s very little I can contribute in conversations. \n\nAny advice on how to reconnect with people and find the easiness in social scenes? How long did it take you?\n\nThank you for reading and any advice.",

      "title": "Am I being scapegoated?",
      "selftext": "Context: I am 50 F/never married /no children. Last year around this time, I was diagnosed with rectal cancer. I fought a battle that bled me of all my resources; emotional, physical, mental, and financial. At that time I had been living the Midwest USA for the last 20 years. I'm originally from a major city on the east coast. It was mutually decided upon that I would move back to the east coast with family while I got my feet back on the ground.\n\nFor the past few months, I've been living in a midsized house with my aunt and uncle (early 60s), their youngest daughter and her partner (mid 30s), and their 2 toddlers. The positive is the house has three floors, so it's pretty easy to stay out of people's way. The bad is I don't have my own room, so I'm pretty much sofa surfing. It's been quite an adjustment for me as I had lived alone in a 2 bedroom apartment. I've just tried to stay positive because I did consider this a second chance. Even before I moved, I started looking for a job. I've been on several interviews and finally accepted a position even though it's not the best. In the meantime, I'm still looking and interviewing. There hasn't been a time when I haven't been proactively looking for a job since being here. I want my own apartment. I want out. I'm not a leech. \n\nThe aunt and uncle I live with have 3 daughters, my cousins. The youngest one, who I live with, and I have always gotten along. I've always had the best relationship with their middle daughter. However, she lives almost an hour away. I believe she keeps her distance because she doesn't want to be involved in any drama. Their oldest daughter (40) lives about five minutes away and is a monster. Negative, controlling, manipulative, lazy, selfish, spoiled, entitled. Just an awful person. For context, she made her mother, my aunt, cry on her birthday.\n\nDuring my time here I've posted a few pretty innocuous posts on Facebook about the goings on the household. What I've cooked for dinner, maybe a cute thing one of the kids said, etc. I never post pictures of the children and maybe in two of the posts I used one of the kids' first names. I never tag anyone in them. I try to make them anonymous as possible because I know my family aren't big social media people. \n\nA few days ago, monster cousin went to my aunt and blew everything out of portion about what I was saying on Facebook. My aunt doesn't have social media and doesn't understand it. Monster cousin made it sound as though I was giving out everyone's personal information for all of the Internet to see. Just absolutely ridiculous. Just drama. Like I said my aunt doesn't have social media but neither does my cousin that I live with. However, her partner does. Anyway, my aunt ended up leaving me a note asked for me to take down the posts. I also had a nice talk with my live-in cousin about it. Everything was taken down and went back to normal.\n\nA little bit later it was suggested to me by my best friend that it might be in my best interest to block monster cousin and other cousin's partner for a minute. Clearly, monster cousin has been trolling my page, looking for anything to make me a target. So, I did. It was my understanding that you could block someone on your friend list for a little bit without them knowing and then reinstate them at anytime. Well, the rules have changed. Now when you block someone on Facebook, it deletes them off your friends list. So, I unwittingly deleted monster cousin and other cousin's partner off my friend list.\n\nThe other night, I got home from work and was told by my uncle that my aunt and live-in cousin were over at monster cousin's. I knew something was wrong. I went to Facebook and saw who I had deleted. I quickly then deleted my Facebook account. Like I've said, I've consider my time here a gift and a new start. I am not trying to rock the boat. I'm obviously willing to give up social media to keep the peace.\n\nOf course, yesterday my aunt wanted to talk to me. I explained to her that I didn't delete them, I deleted me. She bought it. I just hope the others do as well. In the meantime, her live-in daughter was making all kinds of threats about leaving if I stay. My aunt and uncle can't afford the house with my cousin's financial contributions. I mean, just insane drama all the way around.\n\nWhat I have found out in my time living here is how insane monster cousin is. I always knew she was negative but I didn't realize how crazy she was. I genuinely think she loves to see her mother upset and her mom is the best. It's so unfortunate .I've also learned that live-in cousin and her partner have a terrible relationship. He's left and came back a few times since I've been here. Anyway, I just feel that I'm being scapegoated. I feel like their just living miserable lives and instead of looking at themselves, they're using me as a punching bag. \n\nI'm not sure what my next step will be. I'm already looking into moving back to the Midwest. It kills me because there are other family members here that I don't want to leave but their homes are not equipped to take me in.\n\nSorry if this is rambling but I'm a mess. This has been written in haste as well, so excuse the typos. I've got to go now and get ready for an interview. My third one with the same company. Fingers crossed. TIA for all the feedback.",

      "selftext": "There's a lot out there about how visiting your parents can be triggering of childhood trauma, and I've definitely experienced that. But my most recent (current) visit to my mom makes me wonder about the more mundane unpleasantness of visiting a parent, that I feel I should have more control over. \n\nA few specifics, my mom moved from the town I grew up in to a small college town. I don't have any connection to the town and I don't particularly like it. It's fine, and there's a small, walkable downtown. Decent coffee shops, a bookstore. The state is very Republican, but the town is more liberal. \n\nI don't drive, so can't access anything outside of the downtown without my mom driving, which contributes to restlessness and feeling like a child. \nI actually got my license last year, in part with this situation in mind, but I live in New York and rarely practice, so I'm not comfortable driving alone.\n\nI guess my question is, what do people do when they visit their parents? There's something that feels inherently awkard about being 30, single, no kids, visiting my mom alone. I do have a sister, but she more or less refuses to visit. She has a more fraught relationship with our mom, so if I visit im on my own.\n\nI try taking walks alone, reading, tackling some administrative things for my own life. But I feel so disconnected from myself and my real life when I visit that it's hard to focus on that sort of thing. My mom is getting older and I don't want to avoid visits with her because of my own discomfort. In the past she's contributed to it by being difficult in certain ways, but I notice my anxiety and discomfort arising just from feeling stuck, regardless of her actions. \n\nHow do I relax, have more fun, and feel less alienated on these visits?",

I live about 20 minutes away from the office which I’m in 5 days a week and work from 8am to around 7pm each day (sometimes later 8/9). I have about $40k in college debt that I’m not super concerned about because I’m sure my next two bonuses will cover it. \n\nI have a very very close relationship with my mom. My father was abusive so it was a bit tough growing up. I dormed for college and after graduating just fully moved into my own apartment im in now so have already been away from home for ~7 years including college. My mom lives about an hour away from me- so not far. But she’s been saying things like “I don’t have a lot of time left” and I want to spend more time with her than anything. That’s my number one priority. So I’ve been debating moving back in with her to one. Help her financially so she doesn’t have to work as much (she works 6 days a week and if I can give her half of what I pay in rent it would be a game changer for her). Two. Just be around her more (and my dog). The cons are that one I wouldn’t have my own place obviously, even tho my mom allows me to do literally whatever and is the best mom ever. Two. I would add about an hour to my commute one way, when I already work so much. Three. I’m already struggling with my social and romantic life (I feel like I have mo friends). So this may make it worse but I may feel less lonely being around my mom. I’m spiraling so much on this- my lease is up in Jan so I have a few months to decide but what do you guys think? I’d also save so much money in rent ",

Honestly, I've tried to write this post four times now without giving too much medical information, so to summarize: four years ago, I had a doctor refuse to listen to my concerns about my weight as I gained twenty pounds, over the span of four months. The doctor then accused me of lying to myself and not doing enough to take care of myself. So when it comes to my weight and how hard I've been working to lose it, with what feels like no results, I'm angry, depressed and tired. I don't know how to have a conversation without wanting to scream because it's the only way to get people to listen. It sucks that I know this to be true. \n\nI think I just need to find someone else, but finding someone else who wants to listen is just impossible. Because 'fat girl is fat because she eats' is all anyone ever wants to consider. \n",

And I feel like I’ve done all of the things that you’re supposed to do to get your life straightened out, and to be a responsible human being, but I only hang out with my parents. I’ve left all of my friends in the city that are degenerates and we really have nothing in common anymore. And I work at a logistics company, where I have *absolutely* nothing in common with any of the very Republican, and let’s say eccentric, coworkers. I just feel like I’m in a really in between phase right now where I’m trying to figure out where I should move, and if I should buy a house, or if I should say fuck it and move back to the city.

      "selftext": "I (33M) was part of a band, and we got on decently for quite a while. We hung out all the time, going out for meals and to movies and concerts as well, I considered them my best friends. Eventually though one of the members started to seem more and more insulting. I thought she was just roasting me, so I laughed it off. I thought that we were close, and so we could trade insults in a friendly way.\n\nEventually though it started to seem like it was coming from a genuinely malicious place. It started to seem like most of the insults were focused on me specifically in the group from this one person and she would respond to others in a friendly, happy way and then when I would talk to her she'd respond in a rude, curt way. It seemed like it went beyond just insulting, but her entire attitude to me was aggressive and negative.\n\nMy opinion is that if an insult is coming from a place of warmth, then it means that you have a close relationship with that person. If the insults are coming from a cold place of genuine dislike, then that's not something I'm comfortable with.\n\nI ended up leaving that band because I just didn't want to deal with the constant insults anymore. I'm feeling a bit of guilt about it, she sent a long message about how they felt sad that I left and weren't happy with how I did it (which is fair after being friends for so long, I should have talked to them in person). I wonder if maybe I should have just taken the insults in stride, but it genuinely seemed like she just didn't like me. So I was wondering if maybe I was oversensitive, but going with my gut I'm happy with my decision to leave.\n\nWhat's your opinion on friends insulting each other? Gentle ribbing vs. going extreme on personal things? Where do you draw the line? Do you think it means you are close if you insult each other?",

And then AI just matched people up and set things up for you.\n\nLike imagine you get a text:\n\n>\n\nYou could just say yes or no.

      "title": "I really hate a lot of my family",
      "selftext": "First off I don't know how to encapsulate everything. Right now I'm in California and a lot of my family is on the east coast in NY. I haven't seen them in over 5 years. I'm not exactly sure how to put it into perspective but I'm going to try to explain it and justify why I don't talk to a lot of them. \n\nFirst off from age 8-18 I stayed with my grandmother. My dad had custody of me but he wasn't able to take care of me due to him having schizophrenia. My mom was put in jail after she tried to \"kidnap\" and take me to Iowa. That being said my grandmother (on my dad's side) was not a kind woman. She was actually very strict, vindictive, mean, narcissistic, etc. my grandmother said a lot of nasty things about my mother often implying that my mom SAd me as a child. I didn't really have a childhood when I was with my grandma. I didn't really have many friends over. No allowance, go outside, work in the garden, etc. She would lock me out of the house. She would say I needed to work outside to earn my bath and meals. She would watch me from the window inside the house and tap at it if I wasn't working. She never trusted me with a key to the house even when I was older. She thought I would let my mother in. How does this relate? I'll get to it. My uncles would often defend her. They would often say things like \"just get along with her.\" Dismissing a lot of what I had to say. Often acting like her police force. Anyways, on my birthday she passed (several years ago). They never said anything bad about her or validated any of my feelings. My mother went and (god bless her) she's one of the few who understands. She was mad too and wanted to say something at her funeral. \n\nNow that the main narcissist was dead the other flying monkeys start evolving *Pokemon evolving sounds*. \"Flying monkeys have now become the narcissist!\" *Da da dat dat da da* The main ones are my Uncle Dan and Uncle Eric. They are often dismissive, short tempered, vindictive, etc. My Uncle Dan has anger issues. One July 4th he got mad at his dog and kicked it. Just doing something like asking him to clarify or repeat something makes him mad. My Uncle Dan also bragged about his time in the military and being versed in psychological warfare. As a teenager he told me that he could ban me from public places so I couldn't run away. He told me he could read me like a comic book. I talk too much according to my Uncle Eric. The last time I talked on the phone with him was when my Uncle Mark passed. You want to know how the conversation went? \"C your Uncle Mark died. You don't have to come out for the funeral or anything. OKAAAYY BYYEEEE!\" The last text I got from him was \"C you need to try and reach out to us once in a while.\" Basically they say \"keep in touch but I won't be assed to do anything aside from a text once in a great while. But send us a postcard, a text, call us, send us pictures of where you live, etc.\" You want to know what happens when I try to talk to them 80% of the time? Either there's no response or they act like I'm just talking at them and annoying them. I met Bruce Campbell, one of my Uncle Dan's favorite actors. I was all excited and his response? \"I don't get what's going on C. Why are you sending me this?\" The other uncles do not say anything or butt in. They often stay out or stay passive. \n\nIt's hard to convey in one post just how toxic my family is. It's hard to drive home without seeming like I'm rambling. I know some of you won't care or look at it like it's a big deal. You might say \"oh that's in the past. Talk to them! Reach out reestablish communication!!!\" Why? Aside from text on the holidays or something once in a while I just don't bother. I basically grey rock them. I mean why should I bother to talk and communicate with them? It doesn't ring the same for me like it does for you. \"You'll regret it when they're gone.\" Some of you are seriously all about \"putting the past in the past\", forgiveness, etc. from my previous post. Why? \"Who cares about politics?!\" \"Who cares about the past?!\" Why should I try to establish communication when a lot of the time I feel like I'm bothering them? Why should I give them grace, forgiveness, etc. when they haven't changed all that much? \n\nI'm 36 and maybe my perspective will soften but why should I let toxic people in who don't give a shit? Why should I bother talking to them? People who defended and became a narcissist (or have very strong narcissistic tendencies.) People who don't listen to me. People who want me to talk to them but when I communicate it's like most of the time I'm bothering them. Most of the time I feel like I don't exist to them. \n\nSpending time with them 90% of the time is miserable. Absolutely fucking miserable. \"C you need to participate and be a part of the family.\" Even when I'm hanging out around my cousins who are playing video games or just sitting next to my uncle. If I go and \"participate\" my other cousins or family will look at me strange, laugh, whisper amongst themselves, etc. When I try and be goofy or silly when they are I get shut down. I'm just not allowed and they want the spotlight. \n\nLike I said I don't know if anyone cares or understands. I don't know why I'm trying to justify this to Reddit. This post is already too long so I'm sorry for rambling. I hope that maybe something I said here gave someone a relatable experience(s). I can take solace in that. ",

I would go more into detail, but the moral of the story is it is 100% not ever going to happen and it is such a niche amazing job that I’ve dreamed of my entire life that I ended being disqualified for after being selected for it and going through initial training. \n\nLike I said, it’s been a year. I’m stuck doing a job I despise and I have not been able to shake the fact that I had my dreams right in my hands. I was so relieved that something was working out for me because I’ve failed at a lot of other things in life, but this was something I worked nonstop and it’s gone. \n\nHow do you get over it? I know thats therapist level conversations, but that’s, unfortunately, not an option. I’m just looking for some advice on how you find a new passion or dream or enjoyment in what you do? I’ve done the basics, got new hobbies, moved states to start over, tried to immerse myself in a new challenging job, tried reading, tried blocking it out of my mind, researching new careers, talking it out. Do you just live with it? \n\nI don’t need answers to make me feel better, I just need any advice you have. \n\n\n",

      "selftext": "It's been over a year since our breakup, which was amicable on the surface, but I'm realizing now how much it's lingered beneath. We were together for over five years. The end wasn’t due to betrayal or conflict – it was about marriage. I wanted it; he didn’t, and not because of me, but because of my family.  \n  \nThat hit a nerve I didn’t expect. I grew up with emotionally distant parents — the kind where I often wished they’d just separate and be done. They've never approved of anyone I’ve dated, including him. For this ex, their \"reasons\" were that he was not physically attractive and our zodiac signs are not compatible (we're both Asian).   \n  \nI did let him know about my parents' disapproval, but honestly, I didn't care much because my parents have always been absent from my life for as long as I can remember (E.g, they literally don't even know which school I attended and didn't attend any of my graduations since I was a kid). And I thought we were on the same page about how little their opinions mattered.  \n  \nHowever, when we broke up, he specifically told me that he didn't want to marry, not because of me, but because of my parents. He said he can't bear having in-laws like that, and he didn't want his kids growing up with grandparents like them. This honestly left a strong mark.   \n  \nIn therapy, I’ve been unpacking all of this, and the more I understand myself, the more resentment I feel toward him. Not because he didn’t want marriage, but because he made me feel that I’m forever tethered to the dysfunction I grew up in. That no matter how much I distance myself from my parents, their shadow still ruins things I care about.  \n  \nIt's been a year, and things only get worse. I feel a kind of PTSD now when dating. I fear being judged not for who I am, but for where I come from.   \n  \nI don’t want to feel this way forever. But I don’t know how to let it go, either.",

      "selftext": "Not sure if this is the right sub for this, but here goes. Sorry, it's a bit long.\n\nI've been friends with a person, let's call her Allie, since just before COVID. Allie found me through a friend's business where I hang out lots. We started chatting there and then hanging out in our spare time. Allie is a great person and she's the kind of person that goes 100% in on everything - kind of to the point where it comes off as she is trying too hard, people-pleasing etc. It's almost like she kinda morphs into what you like because she wants to be the best in your eyes. \n\nWhen I met her, Allie was seperating from her husband and was extremely vulnerable emotionally. At first I was kind of happy to be this great friend swooping in and saving the day, being a good shoulder to cry on and staying up late giving advice and support. Her romantic life was a bit of a trrainwreck and I thought I was being helpful by telling her to stay away from this toxic guy she had been essentially having a serious emotional affair with (while married). She eventually divorced her husband and got with this guy she had been chasing, who was gross and awful to her. Needless to say that didn't last very long - I helped her get out of that situation by introducing her to an acquaintance I had through my theatre community. They started dating immediately. Great, she's finally on the right track. Our friendship was great - we would hang out almost daily, I could see a positive change in her in this new relationship and things felt great. \n\nAs she started getting more serious with the new guy, the morphing began. All of a sudden she changed her whole aesthetic and lifestyle. Now, she wants to be a trad wife with kids (when we were hanging out, we spoke often about being childfree forever), she went from wearing patagonia/outdoor lifestyle hiking stuff to long dresses and those hats that influencer girls wear. She changed her job - started working at a coffee shop closer to where her new guy works. She even mentioned that this dude wants to start going to church with her (she is completely and very vocally non-religious, and I had never heard him speak about religion or belonging to any type of church when we did shows together). All of these things gave me some big red flags.\n\nBasically the new guy is a Joe Rogan bro who is looking for a tradwife, and because she is so eager to please, she is becoming this for him. I'm a gay guy and I really prefer not to have anything to do with that scene. Anyways, I've slowly just been distancing myself because it seems that we no longer have anything in common. Have only seen her briefly in passing at the local bar we first met in - she's been with her guy everytime, but we've said a few friendly hellos, had quick catch ups and then she was off. She reached out a couple of days ago and asked to meet for coffee and said that she misses me and our hangouts. I don't really know what to say. On one hand, I want to be honest and tell her that I don't recognize her anymore and she's not really the friend that I had, and that the friendship is essentially over. On the other hand, I also don't want to hurt her feelings or make her question her relationship. I don't like this dude at all but she seems to be happy and that's great for her; if I'm honest with her, she might take that too much to heart and self-sabatoge the whole thing. Really, I would just like her to forget about me so that I don't have to awkwardly make up excuses every time she wants to see me. Or maybe I'm just being too judgmental? I don't know. \n\nNot sure if I'm looking for advice or just a place to vent. Friendships are hard. Thanks for listening. ",

CMS will begin providing states with monthly enrollment reports identifying individuals whose citizenship or immigration status could not be confirmed through federal databases, including the Department of Homeland Security’s Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) program.\n\nStates are responsible for reviewing cases, verifying the citizenship or immigration status of identified individuals, requesting additional documentation if needed, and taking appropriate actions when necessary, including adjusting coverage or enforcing non-citizen eligibility rules. CMS is sending the first set of reports to states today, with all states receiving a report over the course of a month. We expect states to take quick action and will monitor progress on a monthly basis.\n\n“Medicaid is a lifeline for vulnerable Americans — and I will protect it from abuse,” said U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. “We are tightening oversight of enrollment to safeguard taxpayer dollars and guarantee that these vital programs serve only those who are truly eligible under the law.”\n\n“Every dollar misspent is a dollar taken away from an eligible, vulnerable individual in need of Medicaid and CHIP,” said CMS Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz. “This action underscores our unwavering commitment to program integrity, safeguarding taxpayer dollars, and ensuring benefits are strictly reserved for those eligible under the law.”\n\nIndividuals without satisfactory immigration status may only receive limited services in certain circumstances. This initiative reflects CMS’ unwavering commitment to enforcing federal eligibility rules, supporting state compliance, promoting transparency, and upholding the integrity of Medicaid and CHIP for future generations.",

Now 6 years on I live alone, work, work on personal creative projects and occasionally socialize with friends. My daily schedule is exactly the same. I feel the same as I did then. At 28 I thought maybe by now I would have felt differently? Been more wise, more experienced more learned? I do now have a job and pay my own bills but I still feel like I’m 16 playing pretend like I’m an adult despite being 28.\n\nI mean I did: graduate, move halfway across the country, spent years in covid lockdown, decided to move back to my hometown after 5 years away because life is fleeting and my parents needed help. So I did do some things but my day to day is the exact same. In the same time frame I’ve had friends graduate, get married, buy a house, and have a child. \n\nI recently started volunteering to see if that could help im not sure…make me feel like I’ve progressed as an adult? But day to day feels like just another job (I do enjoy the work don’t get me wrong it just wasn’t as transcendent of an experience as I thought). What am I missing? Is it weird to feel the same as when you’re in college?",

      "selftext": "I (28 male) never got to enjoy my teenage or young adult years due to people-pleasing my very strict, controlling, overprotective and sheltering parents plus being too afraid to rebel and being too scared to do anything that my parents might not approve of or anything that will make them feel disappointed in me. For all these years I was very quiet, shy/timid, and basically kept nearly all of my own thoughts and opinions to myself while playing the role of my parent's \"good, responsible and well-behaved son\".\n\nWith that said, I have always felt that there was something missing in my life. Like I had been in the passenger seat of my life for all these years while watching my parents be the driver of my own life. However, last year after a serious life-changing event regarding my health and a lot of soul searching as well as self-reflection (well you can call this an early midlife crisis if you wish to), I have come to realise that I only have one life and that I should live a life true to myself instead of living life for my parents.\n\nAs a result, I am planning to embark on a journey of reclaiming the teenage years and youth that I had missed out of, such as dressing up in alt fashion, partying, making and hanging out with friends, dating around, doing raunchy bed stuff with different girls (if you catch my drift), making memories, having formative experiences, creating my own identity and having wild, reckless fun etc.\n\nSo here is the question: Men in your thirties who are living a \"prolonged youth\" instead of settling into the \"adult life\" – enjoying life, your hobbies and dating around without kids or other extra responsibilities – what are the drawbacks to your lifestyle choice?",

      "selftext": "I guess I was very \"lucky\" when I realized I was horrible at gambling in my early 20s. It completely turned me off to the scam. I have enough bad vices and I'm glad this didn't become another one.\n\nI grew up in the 80s outside of Boston and was a Red Sox/Pats/Bruins/Celtics fan not by choice, but by proxy. I grew up following all \"my teams\" and was excited for every new season for each team's chance at making it to the finals and winning. There was so much lore and it was so exciting. Every season was another chance at a championship, finally (Pats, Sox especially in my lifetime). All I ever saw was loss and disappointment, but I finally got to see them both be the best over and over! It was great.\n\nNow, everything in sports is about betting. All the commentators talk about is bets on what a person or team is going to do to hit a bet. Everything is sponsored by Draft Kings or similar. It's become unwatchable. I don't care anymore.\n\nI'm currently 47 and don't think I'll ever go back to watching sports as I did for most of my entire life, and it fucking sucks. Fuck capitalism.",

      "selftext": "I’ll say I do understand adults can’t always make time for just their friends. That being said I had some codependent best friendships in my life especially one that ended in my early 20s. This friend, I assumed things will go better since I know how to have healthy distance/ worked through things? Also I’m a bit older. \n\nShe has a fiance, they have a friend group from college. I met them for her past 3 birthday parties and her fiancés bdays/ other events. I invited this friend and her fiance to my Halloween/ Friendsgiving and even some mutual friends event who said I can bring my other friends. But in more recent times this friend has told me she wants more friends/ her college friends don’t live up to her ambitions anymore. She also said things that felt aimed at me. Like she outgrew friends who are more into xyz. I won’t get into that but it felt like she’s describing us growing part.\n\nWhen it was my birthday I invited her this year. It came time to her birthday days ago. I wished her a happy bday and said let’s celebrate soon. When we did meet I asked what she did, she said she met with her friends but it was so last minute. From her description it’s her coworkers, friends she met through coworkers, and her college group plus fiance. It stung a bit because we always invite one another. But I didn’t pry. She also dodged my Friendsgiving plans, and said she’d invite me to her coworker new years thing at her house. But she never did. She also talks about events/ tells me about people assuming I already met them. Then backtracks or sometimes just forgets things I told her.\n\nI mentioned going back to school, she said she didn’t think that was very me. She commented on my physical changes and appearance, saying I lost weight and dyed my hair. But I’ve not changed in those categories for a few years. I think it was more a wake up call— but why do I get so hurt? I’m not a child that must be invited is what people tell me… but I think I just don’t have enough friends and then overthink this. \n\nThis speaks to my greater concerns: my friendships into my 30s and so on… especially as people get married and move away? It’s already happening with people because my mutuals/ friends are mid to late 20s and some in the early 30s. When my mom was a stay at home mother she said she felt lonely/ had few friends. She teaches me to sort of deal with people and accept for who they are, don’t try to control it or you’ll end up friendless. My grandma tells me to distance myself when people begin making slights or acting weird. So id like your views. \n\nQuick EDIT: she does ask me to meet up 1:1 still, & I do too of course ",

I am at the top of financial advancement, and there is little to no chance of salary increase. I have a good retirement package, and I will be able to retire in twenty years. I also have very good job security, and I am confident that my job is not going to disappear. It is a good job, but it's also not like it is a burning passion of my life.

Recently, she has improved significantly in managing those struggles. We are not quite empty nesters, but that is on the horizon. (We will very likely have a much better financial picture once our kids are adults.) I have one main hobby, which is homebrewing. I really enjoy my hobby, but it can't be a 24/7 hobby for obvious health reasons. \n\nI guess I feel lost because of the fact that I have struggled for so long that now that I have a chance to step back and take a breath, I am not sure what direction to take with my life. I am not sure what goals or purpose my life should take or what to do. I don't know if any of you can help me, and perhaps just reading to the end of this post is enough. Thank you. ",

      "selftext": "I’ve been away from home for 8 years with residency and fellowship at an Ivy League institution on the east coast. I’ve been offered a faculty position at the university, which is a great honor. They typically take 1 fellow every few years.\n\nMy parents have made it VERY clear they want me to move home, back to Chicago. They’ve been asking me to move home since the day I left as an intern. My parents are very loving, and I come from a tight knit family, but the guilt tripping about moving home gets old. I know it’s from a place of love, but it seems like they don’t care how much I’ve accomplished career wise. Their number focus is being close with family above all else. I realize there is more to life than your career, but I’m actually quite proud of how much I’ve grown and learned. Realistically, I wouldn’t have had the same opportunities had I stayed home. \n\nMy husband is pretty indifferent. He’s also from Chicago. He works remotely. We moved here for my job originally and he enjoys being here, but if I told him we should move home, he would be happy to as well.\n\nWe also have a two year old daughter and another baby on the way. \n\nI’ve made a small pro/con list of moving home. \n\nPros\n- I do love my family. I love watching my daughter with her cousins and grandparents\n- My parents would be extremely helpful with raising our child. I watch my parents help my sister tremendously with pick ups, sick days etc.\n- My husbands parents are also in Chicago. I don’t think his parents would be as helpful, he doesn’t come from as tight knit family as ours, but it would obviously be nice to see them as well. His sisters live elsewhere.\n- I feel like a lot of our vacation and money is spent on traveling to see family. It would be nice to have family in our everyday life and then use those resources on other vacations\n\nCons\n- I have been offered a great job to start as an attending. It would be nice to start my first job here where I know the people and the system. People tell me how difficult the first year as an attending is, and given being a new young mom, I think it would be helpful to be somewhere I’m familiar. \n- I could get a job in Chicago, but to be close to my family, I would need to probably need to work at a private practice which doesn’t really make sense at this point in my career. I could work at a university but I would either have a terrible commute and live near my family or live near the university which knowing the neighborhood, I am not interested in raising a family near there\n- We have a very good workflow for our daughter in terms of child care with day care, pediatricians, babysitters, etc. \n- Financially, I cannot afford a large move. I didn’t make a lot of money in fellowship and residency. A large move with my children and husband would be difficult. I don’t have money for a down payment. Would need to rent for a while. My parents have offered to let us stay with them if needed, but again, this would be a lot of logistics and many transitions…\n- It bothers me how much my parents guilt me about this. I’m doing best I can. They make me feel like a really selfish person for moving away, and it’s hurtful.\n\nI think the best path would be to start as an attending at my university. Save some money and then move back home once I have more clarity on my career and am in a more stable place financially. I’m dreading telling my parents. They will be *devastated*. \n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\n\n\nEdit: thank you all for the kind replies. It’s wonderful that people take time out of their day to listen to my internal voice and give me advice.",

      "selftext": "Hello all! \n\nI feel burnt out from social life and I am at the point where I only want to socialize with a few people. I used to be a big social butterfly despite my depression and anxiety. I didn't mind texting, snap chatting, talking on Instagram and I loved to go out shopping and get drinks and dance with friends. After I moved cities and had a breakdown I've slowly tried to figure out the things that caused my depression and anxiety to go crazy. My husband is a big help and we do almost everything together which I love. I started raving in 2023 and that's my favorite thing to do now.  My husbabd and I made a lot of friends within raving. I still have some childhood friends but I used to mostly work, go to the gym, go to a few festivals/shows, and hang out at home but now I feel so busy all time when people want to hang out on top of those activities. \n\nI had a few friends from the rave scene that I had some difficulty with. One was a very mean girl who talks bad about all her friends. After being around the mean girl for so long I learned I was mimicking her if that makes sense. I tend to be a people pleaser and I had adopted her behavior and started to do as she did and I realized after a while that I was so miserable and I wasn't having any friends and she was so draining. After she said she wasnt excited to hang out with me at a festival I decided I wanted to cleanse myself of the negativity and try to do better for myself. I have a lot childhood trauma that makes me think about the same things a lot until I've lost interested or found a solution so it took a lot to get this point.\n\nAfter I started to work on a better version of myself I noticed a lot people including family wanted to spend time with my husband and I. And I mean a lot. We started having back to back weekends of doing things like going salt river tubing, going to shows, going out to a bar or two, dinner with family, out of town shows, crafts at home, game nights, birthday parties. I had started a new full time manager job at about the same time and after 5 months I'm so tired. This job is kicking my ass and trying to socialize and do all these things has rung me dry. I started telling people I was really busy and super tired and it felt like no one was listening because they would ask to do more stuff. I have now noticed my patience has gone down and my attention span is difficult to keep. I have also noticed a lot of these people lately don't seem to interested in my life despite how busy i have been. An example is we met up with my inlaws for lunch and my MIL and I used to chat up a storm for hours about things we BOTH wanted to talk about. At the lunch the MIL only talked about her work and things she had going on, and barely asked about our lives. its been like this the last few visits with them and its made us mot excited to see them. My husband definitely notices. So now I get irritated listening to everyone (except a few friends) talk about their lives and drama and struggles. The mean rave friend tried to hang out despite us not seeing eachother for months and I had to keep being like \"omg girl I have so much going on for the next two months\" and she still kept asking.  I'm going to my first out-of-state camping festival next month and my mom asked when we were going and I told her when, and then she asked me if I wanted to go salt river tubing the weekend right after we get back.  I did not enjoy going Salt River tubing with her last time because she made everything very difficult and I said I'm not going again and her asking me felt disrespectful of my time. \n\nI'm just at the point where I'm about to tell everyone that I don't want to spend time with them no more but that's not the truth of reality. I just wantt them to be able to understand that I am a human and I need time to myself as well. If I say \"I've been so busy and tired\" why would you then ask me to go to more things? ",

      "selftext": "I’m not even sure where to start, but I’ve had someone on my mind constantly lately. We used to be really close friends — the kind of friend you share inside jokes with, who knows your weird quirks, who you could text at 2am and actually get a reply.\n\nThings between us turned sour, and I still can’t fully pinpoint when the shift happened. There were misunderstandings, hurt feelings, and probably unspoken resentments on both sides. One day we were fine, and the next, it felt like there was this invisible wall between us. Eventually, we just stopped talking.\n\nI didn’t just let it happen without trying. I had so many talks with her — hoping we could really hear each other and work through things. But in those talks, she’d often get sassy and frame it as everything she’d done from her side, almost like it was proof she’d been trying while I hadn’t. Meanwhile, I kept saying, “Okay, we both made efforts — they just didn’t land the way the other person needed. So let’s figure it out together.” But that part never really got through. It felt like we stayed stuck in proving ourselves instead of actually fixing things.\n\nDuring the talks she’s used words or phrases like  “you’re overthinking”, “you need to flush it in the toilet and you will feel better”, “you’re holding onto things”, “everyone let go but you”, etc which doesn’t help me at all. \n\nI thought I’d move on. I thought time would dull it. But she still pops into my head randomly — when I see something she would’ve loved, when I hear a joke she would’ve laughed at, or even when I pass the café we used to sit in for hours.\n\nIt’s this weird mix of sadness and nostalgia. I don’t even know if she thinks of me, or if she’s happy without me in her life. Part of me wants to reach out, but another part is terrified it would just make things worse, or confirm she’s moved on completely.\n\nI guess I’m just wondering if anyone else has had a friendship they couldn’t stop thinking about, even when it’s clear it’s over. Does it ever go away? It’s been couple years and I see no improvement in myself getting past it because I feel like I’m still on square 1",

I’ve tried so hard for months to find a job home, and for the past two months i’ve been looking at different jobs here, i’ve had absolutely no luck. \n\ni don’t want to be a quitter, i’ve done that once or twice and i hate feeling like i’m running away from my problems, and genuinely i don’t think i’m going to be happy even if i move back as my family is quite disappointing too. I can’t keep living in between worlds, and i’m terrified to do anything without having a job lined up because it’s been so hard to find anything. any advice you have to share, i would love to hear it. thank you 🫶\n\n\n— thank you for all your wonderful advice and encouraging words 💕 im going to keep trying my best to get out of here and find a new job somewhere i think i’ll like. \n\nETA:\n\nfor those that asked, i work in community engagement for sustainability programs (energy efficiency, stormwater pollution, etc) \n\ni’m not scared of going somewhere new, it’s the fact i can’t find a job which is so disheartening, and the feeling of always being in limbo, even if i’ve decided something, which i had, it will be months of living in uncertainty on top of the two years i’ve already spent in it until i get a new job (im not going to move without one) \n\ni have a cat so moving all the time like some suggest is kinda hard! even traveling home for christmas can be a challenge with finding care haha",

      "selftext": "I just ran across a fairly recent post (posted within the last 2 hours) in r/ Relationship\\_Advice about a guy who has to go to his mother's funeral in a few days, and is mad that his girlfriend says she can't take the time off from work to also attend because of an important presentation she has to deliver.\n\n\n\nI feel like I'm going insane reading the comments. 99% of the comments are telling him what a horrible person his girlfriend is, and how he should leave her. And I seriously don't get it.\n\n\n\nIf his girlfriend was a fucking Starbucks barista, I could get it. She is replaceable. She can ask for the time off, the manager can grant it, and there will be another barista taking her place while she is gone. The manager might not be happy about it, but as long as the shift was covered adequately he probably wouldn't give much of a damn. Taking time off for something like this isn't (or at least shouldn't) be a big deal when you're just a small cog in a big machine.\n\n\n\nBut if you're in the adult world, if you're in a professional job and working to advance your professional career, taking time off isn't always a given. Sometimes you really are the only person qualified, and/or best qualified, to complete a certain task. Even if your boss grudgingly grants the time off to you, this presentation could well be the sort of thing that determines whether or not your company gets a million-dollar contract - and your unwillingness to do it (excuse or not) can absolutely affect your future career prospects with the company. In some situations, you're simply not replaceable.\n\n\n\nIf it's your own parent who just died, no reasonable employer is going to hold it against you. And in fact, as a surviving child, you're probably going to be carrying at least some of the burden of planning the funeral, helping your siblings make decisions and arrangements, etc. But your boyfriend's mom? Nah, you're just there for emotional support - which isn't necessarily trivial, but is probably not materially necessary either.\n\n\n\nI had a girlfriend when my father died. And at that time she was working at a fast food place. She probably could have gotten the time off from work to drive with me 400 miles to the state my father had been living in upon his death. But why would I ask her to? What value would she have brought to the situation? I wouldn't have dreamed of asking her to take the time off, and she only worked at a fucking fast food place, i.e. a job and not a career. Had she been on a career path, I doubly wouldn't have asked her to take the time off. Had she been on a career path, and volunteered to take time off, and if it definitely wouldn't have had a negative impact on her career, I wouldn't have turned her down - but I wouldn't have *asked* her to do so under virtually any circumstances.\n\n\n\nI feel like r/ Relationship\\_Advice is overrun by people in their late teens and early twenties, who have no idea what it's like to have employment more significant than a minimum wage job, and an employer who sees you as more than just a replaceable warm body in a uniform.",

He wouldn’t be alone, and my dad would be there. \n\nI have extreme anxiety and I overthink/have OCD about some stuff. I have this feeling that if I watch them put him down, I will go into a pit of overthinking and replaying it in my head the next few weeks and I think it may be too much for me. (Funny enough, I’m a nurse but this is too much for me…) \n\nI feel so guilty about not going. Will he know and realize I didn’t go? Will he even realize what’s going on? I feel better knowing my dad will be there but I’m so sad about putting him down, realizing I won’t be able to hug him or give him pets anymore, and feeling so guilty about not going. I think I just need someone to tell me their experience not going and if they feel as if they made a good choice.",

      "selftext": "Last night, I met a young woman who recently lost everything in a house fire just last week. I only knew of her because she had been quietly posting in some local groups asking for someone to bring her a prayerbook. No one had responded, so I offered, and delivered it to her this evening. \n\nShe’s staying in a temporary hotel placement from her insurance, and is visibly in shock—grappling with the emotional and logistical aftermath alone. She didn’t ask for money, or help, or pity. Just the prayerbook. She's barely eating, so I bought her dinner at the restaurant next door to her hotel, and it quickly became clear how disoriented and overwhelmed she is. She is visibly in shock, and I don't quite think she yet realizes the emotional and psychological fallout from what has happened to her. She doesn't seem to have family nearby, so from what I can gather, she has very limited (if any) support nearby. \n\nHere’s where I could use some real adult wisdom:\nI’m not in a financial position to do much, since I was laid off a few months ago, but I want to help in a way that’s meaningful and actually supportive, not just performative. I’m thinking of rallying some of my own friends and local networks to gather gift cards and basic supplies, but I’m also wondering:\n\n- What kinds of help actually make a difference to someone who’s just lost their home?\n- Are there any pitfalls I should avoid, emotionally, logistically, ethically? \n- How do you show up in someone’s life during a crisis—especially a stranger’s—without overwhelming them or centering yourself?\n\nI’m not trying to “save” anyone. I've faced adversity myself in life — from chemotherapy and paralysis to escaping domestic violence, so I know suffering, but this is outside my realm of knowledge or understanding, and isn't something I've encountered before. I just want to do what I’d hope someone would do if I were in her shoes. Thanks in advance for your thoughts. I don’t want to fumble this.  ",

      "selftext": "This morning, I (30M) quit my job. A very well paying job. I have worked multiple different types of jobs since I was 15 and never once quit a job without having something else lined up. I have been continuously employed for my over half my life so this feels really weird and is uncharted territory for me. \n\nWhy did I quit you ask? Yesterday, my wife’s grandfather who owns the company I worked for, called me into a meeting in front of 3 of my other coworkers and proceeded to spend two hours yelling and swearing at me, blaming me for every single problem in the company and his personal life. Yes, even his wife being mad at him for cheating on her is somehow my fault too. I have put my heart and soul into that place trying to do whatever I could to make it better and none of it meant a single thing to him. \n\nI am very proud of myself because I stayed calm, professional, and never once raised my voice despite the absolute vitriol being spewed at me. Multiple times he got so angry that he got up and walked out of the room, slamming the door inches from my head. At another point, he got up from the chair that he was sitting in, picked it up, and threw it down. He also threatened “if we can’t solve these problems in here, then we can take it out back”. And despite all of that, he refused to fire me, even when asked directly. \n\nI finished the day, but my mind was made up. I can’t continue to work in a place where I am seen as the antagonist, where I have no room for growth, where I am physically threatened and intimidated. This morning before anyone got to the office, I cleaned out my things, left my resignation letter on his door, and dropped my keys on the desk. \n\nThe part that really sucks? I still feel like a failure. I feel like I lost. I gave up a lot to take that job. We moved states. I had a dream job and a house with a dirt cheap mortgage. The interest rate on our house now is almost 3x what our last was. I’m mad but mostly sad. \n\nSo where do I go from here? \n\nI’m trying to focus on the positives. My wife, who was 10000% in support of my departure, has a good, stable job with good, affordable insurance I can get on. Will her salary pay all the bills? No. Will it cover the mortgage and a decent majority of the bills? Yes. Do we have savings? Yes, a pretty comfortable 12 months. Do I have a roof over my head and food in the pantry? Yes. Is my family happy and healthy? Yes. \n\nWhen I put it like that, maybe it’s not all so bad. \n\nAlso, maybe this is a blessing in disguise? At the beginning of this year, I had started to read the writing on the wall. As a cautionary measure, I did something I’ve always wanted to do and started my own construction company on the side. We finally got all our licenses and stuff in order around April and have had a small handful of jobs so far. The model we’ve developed to operate on has proven profitable, but because of my other work obligations, I honestly haven’t had the bandwidth to be able to make the most out of it. It’s not something I could live off of at this exact moment, but if I can increase the volume of work, it’s very possible. At a minimum, with even a tiny bit of growth it could shore up the holes in the boat. So I think now is my opportunity to pour every bit of myself into my own company and see what magic we can make happen. The negative voice in my head is trying hard to tell me it’s a fool’s errand, but I don’t think I’ll ever have a better opportunity or motivation to make this a go. \n\nI feel lost, scared, and uncertain about the future, but trying to remind myself that the sun will come up tomorrow regardless and if I just keep breathing then it’ll be okay. \n\nI would gladly welcome any words of wisdom or advice if someone has gone through something similar. Thanks friends",

      "selftext": "Had a Reddit topic I ran into that sparked this thought process. Apologies for length.\n\nAfter seeing a surprising-to-me set of answers to a popular question on a career/work advice sub, I started looking around there, checking into the sub's other hot topics to get a sense of where people are, and found something concerning: a massive \"I can't cope\" trend among our young workers. \n\nMany upvoted topics were from submitters in their first few years of usually-corporate work who were practically crying for help because they simply could not tolerate their job. Lots of such topics, with a common thread of not being able to function in a mentally healthy way at work, for a variety of reasons.\n\nThere were differences in the descriptions. Many recognized some aspect of personal accountability in it, others blamed 100% of the cause on their employer and environment. Some included self-described issues with resilience and conflict management, with hints of mental health problems. Others described being victims of workplaces that were collectively so evil it was almost surreal, without touching at all on themselves as a participant in the process..\n\nAnd I got to thinking about w1hy \"work\" is so hard for our young adults. Was it because yesterday was a Monday which is the worst day of the week and this floated to the top as a false trend? Or does this apparent but quiet collective tragedy, of so many people not being able to do work that their parents routinely seemed to do, have a basis in reality? \n\nIs it really a symptom of a larger and holistic problem of a world that actually DOES suck for our next generation? \n\nAnd hence we come to the title. \n\nI'm watching the widening gap between the upper and middle class, and the supreme concentration of wealth into the billionaire class, and I think it's a huge root cause for this apparent \"sickness\" of our young earners. Being a billionaire is in many ways antithetical to a moral society. You focus your money on getting more money and power and prestige, when you would still be comfortably rich even after giving a huge chunk of it to causes that could feed thousands for decades, could save a natural environment, could contribute to the knowledge of the human race... on and on.\n\nInstead we have... phenomena like Donald Trump and the current US government who are actively supporting the growth of the gap with their tax breaks and recalls of social programs. We're seeing people who need help be denied that help because it's not \"efficient\". Tribalism and nationalism and \"I just want to get mine\" are replacing empathy to anyone who is not like you. And god help you if you're anything but cisgender.\n\nNo wonder our young adults are in a bad state.\n\nAnd if this is an accurate perception, it leads to the question \"What, if anything, can and should we do about it?\"\n\nYour thoughts welcome.",

      "selftext": "A lot of stories about Derek Huffman going around social media. **[Snopes.com](https://www.snopes.com/news/2025/07/22/derek-huffman-russia-war/)** states that a lot of is only unsubstantiated rumors at this point:\n\n> 1. In July 2025, a claim circulated online that a Texas father had moved his family to Russia before enlisting in the country's armed forces and fighting on the front lines of the war in Ukraine.\n> \n> 2. While it was true that Derek Huffman moved his wife and three daughters to Russia and enlisted in the military there, we found no proof that Huffman ever fought on the front lines of the war in Ukraine.\n> \n> 3. The Huffmans documented their move and Derek Huffman's enlistment on their YouTube channel. In a since-removed video, DeAnna Huffman, Derek Huffman's wife, expressed concern that her husband would be sent to the front lines.\n> \n> 4. However, Tim Kirby, the founder of American Villages in Russia who helped secure housing for the Huffmans, told Snopes over email that Derek Huffman \"was never involved in front line combat.\" Derek Huffman's exact location and role within the Russian Armed Forces remained uncertain at the time of this writing.\n\n\nI wonder what will happen when Derek Huffman discovers that Russia has gay people too.\n\nThis man is an imbecile to move from a democratic republic with a much better economy to whatever Russia is where there are still issues meeting even basic needs.\n\n**If** it is true that he enlisted in the Russian military and is fighting against the Ukrainians trying to preserve democracy in their country then Derek Huffman is a ***traitor***.    \n\nI know this is a lame plea, but please read the article before making a comment about the article.",

      "title": "Memories working in an AIDS facility 30 years ago and the lessons I learned especially from one family of 4, that all died in my arms over the years as their Hospice RN. Mother, father and their two children.  The last child to die had an amazing visitor.",
      "selftext": "I'm thinking this is as good as any sub to share this story. After my two sons were killed in the front yard by a drunk driver in 1989 I changed my focus from being a technical RN to becoming more of a supportive nurse. I became a Hospice RN and worked for the 3 years a local AIDS unit was opened. At the time HIV/AIDS was pretty much a death sentence, there was little treatment available. The hospital where I was working allowed nurses to refuse to provide care for AIDS patients. The nurses that would care for them were double loaded with extra patients. When the local facility opened I was excited to go and support the efforts. We started with 35 beds and advanced to 55 beds for AIDS patients before the unit closed due to lack of funding.\n\nOne family stood out. Supposedly the mother contracted HIV from a blood transfusion (who knows?), gave it to her husband and their baby who at the time was 1.5 years old. They had an older girl, maybe 5 or 7 years old who tested negative. Mom, Dad and the baby all were HIV positive. Mom was dying first. To give her daughter memories to carry with her though life, as the only family member to survive, we'd load mom up with medications so she could sit with her daughter who would visit after school and share a meal together. The smell of food would make mom retch, but we'd give anti nausea medications prior so she could leave her daughter with fond memories of her mom, eating and holding each other.\n\nMom died first, then the baby then the father. I was the RN for all of their deaths, they all died in my arms as the nurse caring for them, over a year or so. The facility closed, I lost contact with the daughter who moved in with her grandmother. Years later I was the RN for an inpatient Pediatric Hospice Unit with 10 beds for terminally ill children. The daughter, now about 10 years old or so showed up. It ended up she converted from HIV negative to positive. Testing wasn't as accurate back then as it is today. She was dying and lived with us at the inpatient unit about 2 weeks. She always wanted to be married so the staff pitched in and got what looked like a child's wedding gown, the girl was so tiny. Maybe it was a flower girl outfit, but it looked so pretty and she adored wearing it constantly. We cut the back of the gown so it would fit over her diapers and hospital gown and look so pretty. She'd admire the gown day and night.\n\nWhen she came in to the Hospice unit she said we should let her cat in. Grandmother said she had no cat but on the other side of the sliding glass door to her room sat a black cat looking in. We opened the door, the can came in and jumped up on the bed snuggling with her. She said it was Oscar and he was her cat. It's Hospice so what the heck, she loved him and so he stayed. At night he'd be at the door and we'd let him in, in the morning he'd leave and come back that night. The night she died, just after midnight, Oscar left and never came back. I wondered it that truly was a cat, or a spirt, an angel, her parents, whatever that came to support the little girl the last 2 weeks of her life, who outlived her family.\n\nThe love her mother had for her daughter, the dedication of Oscar, the joy the girl got out of the wedding gown, all have stuck with me for over 25 years now. It's not what you get it's what you do that matters. I treasure the loving memories of that mother, her family, the little girl, the staff I worked with to care for those children, the cat, etc all these years. The Universal flow of love doesn't come towards us, it comes through us, outward, to others, to the Universe itself.  David Parker, Phoenix Az.  andthisisso on reddit\n\nI made a short video on this family, it's very touching. I didn't want to die and have the story forgotten, here is the link.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcpXlSwaApQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcpXlSwaApQ) \n\nHere is the story of my boys that died ages 7 and 9 while playing in the front yard. A year later they came back and taught me a lesson I never forgot. I hope it has meaning for others.\n\n[https://youtu.be/vYRryRBefdg](https://youtu.be/vYRryRBefdg) ",

      "selftext": "In my country(Serbia), a recent law change has introduced a discriminatory element affecting people who seek to enroll in a new higher education program after previously studying at the same level.\n\nAdmission to higher education institutions is based on a combined score of up to 100 points, derived from an entrance examination and the applicant’s final grades from high school or gymnasium. Up until this year, candidates have been ranked solely based on these scores.\n\nHowever, as of this year, a structural change has been implemented whereby candidates applying to higher education for the first time are prioritized over those who have previously enrolled in a program at the same academic level, regardless of whether they completed it. In practical terms, this means that an applicant with a lower entrance score who is enrolling for the first time may be ranked above a candidate with a significantly higher score who is seeking to change or restart their academic path. This policy is not limited to a single institution but applies across the entire higher education system in Serbia.\n\nTo be more precise a person applying to a new degree is ranked AT THE VERY BOTTOM OF THE LIST. This means that you could have 100 points and still be ranked lower than somebody who hasn't even scored 1 point on his/hers entrance exam.\n\nBecause of this I am practically doomed to never be able to enroll in any college that has a more applicants than there are spots available. Before if that was the case you only had to pay for the first 2 semesters of the year which was okay since its a state funded institution. But now I cant even do that because I will be ranked solely on my former status instead of my aptitude. I don't if this is even legal not to mention constituional where I come from and don't understand how people are so indifferent towards this where I come from.\n\nI am discriminated just because of my life chances when I was 18.\n\nI feel horrible and lost and dont know what to do.\n\n",

      "selftext": "Hello!\n\nI’m trying to figure out where to begin but I’ll try to keep it short and simple, I’m basically making this post for some advice regarding my situation as I feel pretty lost at the moment for what I want to do or what I need to do. \n\nFor context I’m 23 now and I grew up in a small town of a population of about 20,000 people, and absolutely hated everyday. I told myself the moment I graduated high school I would move to the city an hour away and go to college and find my path. My first mistake was moving with my high school gf at the time in which I left to live with some friends in the same city for a while. \nI kinda gave up on the idea of college in that 3 year frame because I was working in a kitchen and thought I really wanted to be a chef till I realized how terrible a chefs life actually is lmao.\n\nMy mom ended up getting sick with cancer and she moved to the city to get an apartment with me and I was her caretaker for maybe half a year before she went to hospice and passed unfortunately, this happened a year and a half ago and I feel like I never gave myself the time to heal, I just took a week off work and smoked a bunch of we*d to cope (terrible idea). I ended up moving into this girls house after my lease ended and dated for about a year before she cheated on me and I cannot for the life of me find a spot to live. \nI’ve been working in a different kitchen now and I’m totally burnt out on life in general. Working 6 days a week because we are low staffed which is literally every kitchen job I have taken and I just feel super stressed out, I feel like I’ve been on 110% since moving out and it’s changed me into such a negative human being. \n\nSo here’s where I need the advice, I had a nice talk on the phone with my dad and kinda got everything off my chest about how I’ve been feeling the past couple years and how life just hasn’t been the best for me and he suggested I should leave my job and come stay with him for a couple months till I get off my feet. I would be paying no rent and most likely I’ll be getting my x ray certification so I can work out at the plant over here. I really hate the idea of living in a small town but at this point I think I’m just ready for a change and want to be closer to my family, I also didn’t really have friends where I was so it was pretty lonely most of the time. I just can’t help but think I may accidentally rush into something I may dislike more yknow. \n\nI just wanted to know if anybody else has been in a situation pretty similar to mine and if moving back and getting situated helped you out a little bit? \n",

I am in regular treatment and currently seek an urgent inpatient treatment. The waiting lists can be rather long for these… \nDue to the most likely genetic pre-proposition and severity of my illness, I decided not to have children and I personally avoid dating as I experienced it as usually destabilising. \n\nBesides these challenges I manage to have a very good job, graduated with a Master of Science. \n\nHowever, I feel lonely. I feel this illness isolates me and while I understand that it can be overwhelming for others to be involved in my mood swings or sometimes not very explainable behaviour to them. \n\nAre there people who have been in the same position and give me tips how to build lasting friendships, that stay when I am in pain and “go nuts”?",

Is this something others experience???\n\n1. Passwords. I swear I have to reset my bank password every time I log in because I forget it. I remember a mix of other passwords (computer, password storage app, phone, etc) but for some reason every time I set my bank one I cant remember in a few days. Its almost always the bank specifically, which is wierd.\n2.

I used to be able to remember the smallest detail from 3 books ago or every plot detail in a favorite series - but I now find that i'll forget entire story lines. Even a book I read a month ago, ill struggle to recall the plot and if i'm reading or watching a series I always have to go back and read the synopsis before I start the next book - marveling at how much of the plot I had forgotten. Granted, there is often a 1+ year gap between books - but its still crazy how much i forget. I dont know if its the volume I consume or that storylines have just become so complex - but it makes me worry\n\nedited to add: female, had a baby at 40 but noticed decline started around 37-38, have had mild covid at least two times --- and I do have dashlane. I just havent added my bank for some reason. I will do that...",

Is this what it’s going to feel like for the rest of my life? Feeling empty and sad and alone when my family leaves after a visit? Wishing I could just live at home for the rest of my life? Wanting to be with my family and my (surviving) childhood pets, in my own bedroom, in my own house? I don’t feel like myself anymore, and at least in college it only felt temporary, but now it feels like forever. Adults out there: is this how you feel every time your parents/siblings/other family leave after a visit? Or do I just need more friends? A partner? Therapy? 😳😩☹️",

      "selftext": "So I've been in my career-- public libraries-- about 15 years. I like it ok. It gives me a lot of flexibility to incorporate the things I enjoy, and it helps people on occasion. That's really nice. I feel like my job is very personally rewarding. I've literally gotten notes from people saying I changed their lives. People give my baked goods on the holidays, it's that kind of job.\n\nThe pay is... not amazing. Livable, but not great.\n\nAnd lately that has been causing more problems. I was working on my car the other day and I got a note from apartment management saying we weren't allowed to work on our cars anywhere in the complex (no, I never leave messes behind). I can't afford to replace the car or buy a house, so I've had to start sneaking around to keep it driveable. \n\nAnd just... socializing and hobbies. They can be expensive, but I'd like to do them. My friends keep talking about their personal trainers and going to Ireland on vacation and I'm like... *can't relate.* \n\nThe thing is, with my particular experience, I could probably hop into project or events management pretty easily. Work even paid for my PMP certification exam because of the particular things I do, and I both qualified and passed pretty easily. Obviously, I wouldn't start with a huge salary and I'm not expecting that, but there is potential for growth that just does not exist in my current field. \n\nBut I have a really hard to time imaging myself working in the corporate world, doing things that don't mean anything to me, making some billionaire richer, just for a paycheck. Most of my well-off friends hate their jobs.\n\nYou can't have everything, and I am struggling to pick which thing I want.\n\nWhat would you do?",

I have a Bachelor's in Psychology, with solidly okay grades - I got lowest honors, *cum laude*, because they rounded my GPA up - but I don't feel like I have the academic chops to do... much of anything. I have very few strong and meaningful relationships with my previous professors - not helped by my transferring schools, as well as COVID - so I worry I won't be able to get letters of recommendation, and I'm just. I'm looking at my life ahead and what it has for me, but I can't see it. \n\nI'm only 24, and I know that's so young, but I'm. Scared of committing to anything. I live with my parents, doing a mediocre job of saving, and I know that any path I do take, I'm going to need to commit to. What if I get rejected from every Master's program I apply to, what if I run out of money, what if my work experience doesn't take me where I'd like it to, what if I never find anywhere that feels like home? \n\nI'm trying to move to Japan, I'm trying to get a PhD, I'm trying to live. Outside of the shadow of a very difficult childhood and undergrad, but as the great William Faulkner once wrote, \"The past is never dead. It's not even past.\" \n\nAny guidance would be very much appreciated. I know things are stable for me right now, but they won't be forever, and in my few years on this blessed earth, I've found that this sort of thing never lasts.",

      "selftext": "I’m a 32 year old liberal Middle Eastern woman from a conservative but safe country. I’ve been in the U.S. for over 11 years. I came here for college, built a life, worked legally under temporary visas, and even went back for a master’s just to maintain my status.\n\nIt’s now been over a year since my last job, my first six-figure role; where I led an entire department on my own. But the environment was toxic with a high turnover rate. I was verbally abused, overworked, and eventually let go. That experience broke something in me. I had to focus on healing physically and mentally before I could even think about working again.\n\nSince then, the job search has felt like an endless cycle. I tailor every application, prepare for every interview, show up with hope, and still, no offers. I’ve made it to final rounds. I’ve been ghosted. I even got an offer that was rescinded when they realized I’m not a U.S. citizen. I’m doing everything I can, and still… nothing lands.\n\nRight now, I’m living in a friend’s spare room because I can’t afford my own space. I feel like I’ve given so much to this country — my time, energy, education, money, heart, and yet I’m stuck in limbo, with no security and no stability.\n\nPart of me wants to give it one last try. This time, I’m applying to jobs that I actually care about; work I’d be proud to do. But permanent residency isn’t guaranteed. Even if I get a job, there’s no promise of a green card. I could be rejected again. And the thought of trying so hard, only to have it all fall apart again is terrifying.\n\nI’m scared that time is slipping by. That I’ll wake up months or years from now and still be here in this same place, just older and more worn down. I’ve thought about going back home, but I know I’d have reverse culture shock there. I’m not traditional. I crave freedom, creativity, nature — the things I fell in love with here. But the truth is, I don’t have a real community or support system in the U.S. either, and that loneliness is starting to feel unbearable.\n\nI keep wondering: is this all a sign that it’s not meant for me? That no matter how hard I try, this life I fought for just… isn’t mine to have?\n\nI never thought I’d end up here — exhausted, isolated, and unsure of where I belong.",

My 2 boys don’t have any interest in being friends with her daughter I think for no other reasons then she’s a girl and they don’t really have similar interests. My kids never asked to see or hang out with the kid in all the time apart. I don’t have any interest in being friends with the mom because she’s just not my type of person, didn’t really feel any connection there. How do I respond to text messages of wanting to get together? I originally responded to initial reconnection message with something along the lines of “oh yes missed you guys too! We should hang out.” That was at least a month or 2 ago and I realize I shouldn’t have said that but have trouble setting boundaries sometimes. Now they’re texting again and sadly none of us are interested. ",

      "title": "Trying to find my north again at 33 (Lost my spark, but not my hope)",
      "selftext": "Hey everybody, hey lovely people,\n\nI’m 33, male and single, and I really need to write this down. Since 2021 (I’m from Germany and experienced the catastrophic Ahrweiler flood back then), I’ve completely lost my sense of direction - my compass just keeps spinning uncontrollably.\n\nRight now, I’m fighting a lawsuit against my landlords (they really threw me under the bus, after i moved out of Ahrweiler I searched for a new place, moved two times and the last landlords were the terrible people who did find it OK to not order heating oil in time for winter and therefore no heating - it was terrible and I, with the dark experience of the flood, had lived through two cold winter with at least one or two months w/o heating, awakening my nightmares once again. I even can't express my disgust against these landlords). On top of that, I have Type 1 Diabetes, ADHD, and depression. Honestly, the best time of my life was before 2021, even when COVID started. Back then, everything still felt “complete,” “anchored” somehow. But today? I have my MSc in Data Science, but no job—and no energy to find a new one. I want to get back on track, but just thinking about it feels overwhelming.\n\nI chose this subreddit because I do feel like a grown-up, and I know exactly how precious life is. I really love the ideas of *Amor fati* and *Memento mori*; they guide me alongside “Be kind to every living being.”\n\nBut how can I stay true to these principles when everything I try just goes south? For example: I’d love to move out of Germany - maybe to Canada, Australia, or somewhere else nice, where I could understand people better. But I’ve never traveled to those places! How do you even make such a big move when everything feels so complicated?\n\nTo make matters worse, my cats destroyed parts of my (very expensive) PC rig. I bought new parts, but it took a huge chunk out of my savings. And I can’t even be mad at my cats - they mean everything to me. But on that same note, I feel no joy in the hobby anymore. Normally, like anyone with ADHD, I’d feel a spark of excitement when new stuff arrives. But now? Nothing. I’m seriously thinking about returning everything (it cost about €7k altogether, including a new desk and chair because of my “sitting at the PC all day” habit) and quitting it all.\n\nSometimes, in very quiet moments deep inside, I tell myself to just let go of everything: sell it all, get on a plane, and fly wherever it takes me.\n\nSo now I’m asking here: what should I do? I do feel ready for a change - honestly, the change is overdue. I even moved back in with my family, which helps in some ways but also makes things worse. They’re great people, but I just don’t align with their lifestyle and need more space to think. But on the other hand, after what happened with my last landlords, I really don’t want to rent again.\n\nWhat hurts the most is that the things that once brought me joy - like building PCs, tinkering, even gaming or watching a show—don’t bring me anything anymore. And photography, especially editing and sharing the world through my eyes? No interest left at all.\n\nI’d really love to hear from some wise human beings - or aliens from other planets, everyone’s welcome! - to share some thoughts or what you went through at 33. Right now, I’m just feeling completely left out.",

      "selftext": "This can all boil down to accountability and just trying to change, on my part. But I wanna tell the story because I need some guidance. I’m 25, but I grew up homeschooled. Not very close to either parent. I remember being sick and them saying I’m a crybaby, or needing glasses and being told I do not. I always felt like i couldn’t trust my own judgement. I did have an escape so to say. We had a group/ groups that met up for homeschooled kids. Like these clubs or groups. I met most of my friends that way. I have one, her father chose to homeschool. Her mother didn’t like it. She’s 27, still lives with the dad and he doesn’t really let her do stuff. But it’s the norm for her, no concerts, hangouts, etc. Very rarely does it happen. And my aunt knows about this friend: she says that’s a good calm girl. But this friend had a boyfriend, the dad found out and apparently it did not last long or go well. My aunt said the dad is good to keep her in check. This is also when I realized she is 27 and probably too old for that dynamic. \n\nMy parents never spoke to me much, we didn’t exactly interact. That is funny considering I’m homeschooled. I spent my time with my grandpa and grandma. I still do. But they argue with me. My parents too. If I talk back I am stubborn. I am expected to listen and accept it. I went to community college, I wasn’t allowed to live away. I don’t think I would’ve known what to do either if I did. I know this post doesn’t make much sense but I asked my parents if I can do the laundry or learn how to cook, and it got them mad a lot. But they’d be mad I didn’t know how to do those things either. I learned a lot on my own or from other family. \n\nI had some friends, especially the ones through these groups. One time I stayed out till 9, I didn’t say how long I’d stay but I called my parents. When I got home I got into so much trouble. I also wasn’t allowed to have a job during college. But when I didn’t work I got called lazy. So I got a job but it caused so much trouble. I also got told for my age it’s weird I didn’t date. I went on a date and my family asked everything. I also was shamed for where we went. I don’t know what I’m doing. I work from home as a job because my family says it’s not safe but they also critique me for not being a hard working person or doing physical labor. \n\nI live with my family, they said if I lived away I’d move back. It’s scary, dangerous, expensive. My aunt again said that my 27 year old friend she is the example to abide by. I notified my aunt I went to get drinks with coworkers because we arranged it. At 24, I never drank before. So I got something very safe? And my aunt was not pleased. My family said dangerous people can find you, that I shouldn’t try to find a partner there. But I didn’t say that.  \n\nI feel like I lack so many life skills. I don’t understand a lot of things my coworkers talk about normally. Like dating, friendship, relationships? I get really nervous or stuck on things. And my childhood friendships are long gone. I think it’s all hitting me because my sister was the closest friend I had but I overheard my parents talking to her about me. This is common too. It hurt. But maybe I am: much, inexperienced, crybaby, overly sensitive. Things they call me. For a lot of reasons. I just need help on what to try and learn first? I’m scared of stepping out and being fully alone in this world but I already am",

Really could use some encouragement here. \n\nBackground: I broke up with my serious boyfriend last year - not by choice- but since we both wanted to live in different countries. I took a leave from my job (in part to deal with the breakup, health issues, and burn out), and came back to unemployement and a terrible job market. I can't help feeling like I've made some wrong turn in life- like all my friends are married with kids and I'm unemployed and single. I'm trying to not compare myself to others but it's hard as I look at the potential of never being able to have kids as time keeps running out and the fact that every day I'm out of the job market is another day I seem less desirable. It doesn't help that my solid of network of friends seems to be slowly dwindling as they don't know what to say to me/are caught up with their own lives. I feel like I've tapped most of my contacts at this point and while mostly polite, they don't know of anything. My family has been supportive, but I just totally deflated and angry at how I seem to keep drawing the short end of the stick. It feels like I can't get a break and some people just have it loads easier with luck. ",

He said material things shouldn’t effect you in your life and so I tried to be strong and not care and move on with my life. 3 months ago, I started a new relationship and couldn’t be in the relationship fully bc of my ex’s things and animals were still at my place. The new guy broke up with me bc of how inconsistent I was with the relationship and not being intentional. I couldn’t bc I didn’t have the space to or is that an excuse? I finally put my foot down with the other ex and he’s getting his things and animals. And I called off of work today bc I just had so much anxiety and depression about it all. I know grown ups have real shit going on in their lives, like being divorced, having shared custody with their children, needing to always go into work bc they have kids, animals, and other things they need to pay for, but I just can’t deal with all this.

I’ve lived in the Carolinas my whole life and I love it for a lot of reasons: affordable, coastal, several nice cities, and good proximity to other metros. I used to live in the country, but I sold that home and moved to the city. I prefer urban centers because I like easy access to restaurants, parks, and coffee shops. Because I have a job that lets me work anywhere, I’m sure I can find a city that has all those things without the hot weather. I’m not looking at places like New York City, San Diego or San Francisco primarily due to COL. I don’t go “out on the town” very often so a lively nightlife isn’t really important. I play a lot of soccer and golf as my outdoor hobbies. I want to keep my car and bring my dog with me but other than that I don’t have a lot of requirements. I’m renting and don’t have plans to buy for 5 years.\n\nThe four cities I’ve researched so far that makes sense are Chicago, Seattle, Minneapolis, and Portland, Maine. I’ve run each city’s cost for my situation and they’re all within $1000 of each other in monthly expenses.\n\ni’ve never been to any of these places, but I plan on traveling to a combo of the cities on two different trips. I’m open to other suggestions as well, but these seem to make sense with what I’m looking for. Would love anyone’s feedback or insight!\n\nEdit: I really appreciate everyone’s feedback. Thanks yall 😊",

The past few years have been a bit turbulent in terms of work as well as I have struggled to hold down jobs so my savings have dwindled. I have realized that I have both mother and father issues and childhood trauma from a chaotic childhood.  I am trying to work on my issues but the progress is very slow.\n\nLately I have become a bit concerned about my future and I do not know what to do. This worry/fear has left me a bit paralyzed in life as I do not know what to do and how to live my life. I am not taking good care of myself and not looking for jobs.\n\nI have always wanted to have a family and own my own house/place to live but it feels like it might never happen. Assuming that I am able to work out my issues and have a proper relationship with a woman and hold down jobs would it still be feasible for me to have a family and a place to live.\n\nShould I have children, I am 45 and I can feel that my energy levels are not the same as they were a few years ago.  Or should I try and figure out another way to live? A lonely life feels horrible as I have always been alone and felt a bit lonely but now that all my friends and cousins have their own families it feels even lonelier as they are busy with their families and they cannot relate to me anymore.\n\nHow would you do it if it you wanted to do it at my age?\n\nI have a background in tech and business and I have a masters degree and I am thinking of getting another masters degree if I can come out my my 'funk'.\n\n\\[I am posting this in multiple forums for older people to get more inputs, I hope this is allowed\\]\n\nedit: made the post a bit less moany + typos.",

I was born in the US but my family and people in the nrotheast are basically tell it how they see it. Im considered the nice humble one of the family even. It's not just my family, it's everybody around me (white, black, latino, etc). They dont care to say something even if it's the hard cold truth. Nobody gets offended. Some of my favorite co-workers were older guys who said it how they felt even if it offended you.. It wasnt to disrespect you, it's to make it clear. Making jokes at each other's expenses was a lvoe language.\n\nMoving down south I thought that this would be similar since im in the land of \"not getting offended\" and my homestate is considered liberal. But it's far from the truth at least in my experience. Seems a lot of people here like to dish it but the second they get it back they get mad. I had a guy try to make a joke at my expense and all was good and I even laughed so I clapped back with a joke of my own. It was aimed towards him and a good zinger. It wasnt even bad or anything crazy and he acted like I disrespected his whole family. He Brought it up for a week straight. Had I said a joke like that back home, the receiver of the joke would've laughed and given me a fist bump for worse jokes.\n\nAs a recent example, I had a party where people left some of their stuff at me and my GF's place. I dont mind it happens, but I also dont want to be keeping people's shit here all the time and id rather nip this in the bud now. It's been a few weeks so the other day I told my GF that I will be telling them that if they dont take it I will give it to goodwill and my GF acted like I was being a tyrant.\n\nAny similar culture shocks?",

We've lost some core members due to deaths or moving away or having other lifestyle changes, while brand new others stepped in and instantly gelled with the group. Some of the sub-themes and in some ways the very nature of the event has morphed and changed. Lots of other little things too, even the size of the trees at the annual place is different now.\n\nIt really does give a sense of the passage of time, but in far more of a pleasant angle than, say, looking in the mirror or stepping on the bathroom scale.\n\nWondering if anyone else has had a long-term affiliation like this and whether it makes them as nostalgic as ours seems to.

She's also been very depressed for 18 years ever since we lost my father, and I'm pretty sure she has PGD. I miss my father everyday, but its crystal CLEAR she hasn't moved on. Which I can understand, they've known each other a long time before my father was shot down in front of her (even more traumatizing for her). Its getting to the point where every little thing she does annoys me, and I'm thinking of moving out. She's very negative to her friends (the stuff she says to me behind their backs), her coworkers, etc. She complains she's lonely, yet she doesn't see that she's a bad person. She clearly needs therapy, and I will be looking for a counselor to speak to. She has a lump on her thyroid gland, and her doctor said it may potentially be cancer. Last month, when she was OBSCENELY drunk, she was crying to me and asking what I'm going to do if she has cancer. I told her that I would help her, and she kept crying and accusing me of \"leaving\" her (I do plan to go to college/university as I graduated HS in 2022. Originally, I planned to leave 2 years ago, but she opened another can of worms here, threatening to commit suicide if I left for school). I'm realizing she's VERY unhealthy, and not a stable person (bless her heart for raising me, but I need to prioritize my own mental health). How do I go about having a conversation with her regarding therapy/counseling. She's TERRIFIED of any form of it, she refuses AA out of fear (she's never gone to AA/therapy/any of the likes). I'm running at the end of my line here, and its getting to the point where I just want to walk out on my mom's life to prioritize my 20s (an important time of everyone's lives). Any suggestions, please?",

We didn't flinch, we selflessly said of course and that was that. They kept saying they were chasing money to pay us back and we eventually just told them not to worry about it. See it as a gift from our hearts.\nOver 6 months ago, my uncle and aunty came to visit. My Aunty broke her ankle as one of our chairs gave way from underneath her (kitchen table chair)\nWe felt so bad and apologised profusely and they approached us asking us to get onto our house insurance so they can claim financials lost due to the injury. Of course, we did that knowing the awful situation changed all aspects of them working as per normal.\nMy partner and I have been in financial difficulties due to stuff arounds on the sale of our investment property.. we have no tenants due to us selling and we were screwed over big time by a company that was set on buying our home delaying the process for months without a deposit only to pull out in the end after 4 months. So the property has been on the market for way too long and we've had two mortgages and sets of rates to cover - hence our financial strains. \nIt was this passing weekend I went on a girl's weekend with my aunty and cousin. My aunty was quite drunk and it came out that they (uncle and aunt) received 18k in compensation for her injury and that they all (including my cousin of which I would class as my best friend/sister) kept it quiet and hid it from us. I was absolutely devastated knowing they knew this and they didn't offer any of that money to help us FINANCIALLY now that we are in desperate need of a little financial support. They knew we have holds on all of our debts due to this.\n I left the following morning while they were asleep as I was stewing on it all night and sent them texts to explain why I left and how I felt. I didn't confront them in person because in the moment of finding out, they both didn't acknowledge my shock and disbelief of what I just heard and my cousin just up and left to go to bed.\n\nThey both came back swinging in their replies and turned it all around accusing me of being so rude for up and leaving and that my cousin was the victim becasue she's in the middle of it all. They both made me feel guilty and missed the whole point of my decision to leave. \nIm so hurt and disappointed by their secrecy. Wouldn't you think they would have told my uncle it's only right to tell us about the 18k and pay back that 3k? They got nasty in the end and did all that they could to make themselves the victims in all of this .. especially my spinless 29-year-old cousin.. protecting her parents now labelling it as she is in the middle of this all and felt it wasn't her place ever to tell me about this.\nThey are greedy scamming people .. money is what is important to them. I believe I made the right choice to block all contact moving forward.  Their gaslighting responses were a trigger of my mother's behaviour and I choose not to have toxic lying family take advantage of my generosity anymore.",

      "selftext": "I rarely post on here, but I’m at my wits end and tired of listening to the few repetitive words that my mother’s primary care team provide day in, day out. For almost 15 years, my mother has suffered through various medical situations throughout my youth. Around 2014-2015 she had a traumatic hospital experience that resulted in renal failure and other autoimmune issues which prompted her to go on hemodialysis treatment for lifetime expectancy. As the years went by, we discovered her condition - Wegener’s Granulomatosis - was responsible for these recurring events that played a degenerative effect on her well being throughout the different stages of her illness. There was a grace period in 2016 where she had been in remission for almost 2 years after an immunotherapy treatment, but it didn’t last long till she once again ended up in the hospital. In attempts to slow down constant recurrences and infections, my family and I have been diligent in maintaining her diet, exercise, and treatments. If there’s one thing that one can’t prevent is daily stresses, but I can proudly say my family and I keep a tight shift in keeping with her general wellbeing. She has overcome overwhelming odds: heart attack, stroke, pulmonary arrest - it’s not an exaggeration to say she’s been lifted from the grips of the death before. Shocking doctors and us in her recovery\n\nWe are now a month into here most recent visit. Came in with shortness of breath and tested positive for Covid (1st time). Previous infections have damaged her lungs significantly and she has now been told her airways have widened (Bronchiechtasis) to the point that she requires oxygen support. The consequence of this hospital is putting everything into perspective… and at the same time confusing the hell out of me. She’s 68, and she’s done fighting. The moment someone says that, the body follows suit. But, theres been upsides where she has energy and is able to endure PT & RT and… it’s strange seeing someone look so well for what she’s going through.\n\nIt’s been the hardest trying to keep her motivation going, and I can really only hope for a miracle for her to pull through. I’ve seen it happen before, she’s no stranger to pain, even though she cannot withstand much of it. I had a brother pass away in his teen years and we did the whole hospice situation…. It was rough, it was his decision, and in his final moments I remember a lot of regrets came to the surface. Nobody can be prepared to lose a loved one, but I’m hoping to hear from something that can turn things around. I want to her to keep fighting for another day, because, regardless of what doctors lecture and statistics read, humans pull through extraordinary adversities. \n\nAny success stories, advice recommendations? I don’t mind hearing a “you’re in my prayers”. I’m very much aware of the reality. My mother’s time could be up and I’m prepared to face it if, and when it happens. In turn, when your chips are down, trying something new could make the biggest change in the last stage of her life. ",

      "selftext": "I've lived in NYC for three decades. I worked very hard to get here in my 20s with no money, and have seen a lot including 9/11, Hurricane Sandy, and Covid. I've dated and had a very long term relationship, and had some success in my industry but have lately settled into the reality of \"failure\" because my industry is pretty much decimated. Very fortunately, I bought a co-op 20 years ago and I love my apartment, but the co-op Board has gotten increasingly power-hungry and annoying, my neighborhood has gotten increasingly crowded and noisy, and I've had several friendships bite the dust. In short, your typical middle-aged crisis.\n\n  \nA couple of years ago, I began obsessing on moving back to my hometown, kind of a rural-ish area that is beautiful and has had a lot of amenities come in like huge grocery stories, excellent restaurants, etc. But it still has a very charming, historical vibe. I only have one remaining friend there, and then my relatives in the local cemetery.\n\n  \nThe town has gotten quite expensive, and the housing stock is mostly single fam homes—I've never owned a house and am quite concerned about upkeep as I live alone.\n\n  \nMy eyesight is terrible due to an eye condition and driving at night is not feasible but... Ubers? (I know they are not as plentiful in the country.)\n\n  \nI dunno. I feel like everyone goes through a \"get me out of here\" phase who lives in NYC. And maybe everyone middle-aged goes through a \"I want to go back home\" stage.\n\n  \nHas anyone moved back to their hometown after a significant period of time simply for nostalgia and how did it work out?\n\n  \nThank you for listening.",

Whether they’re your family or finishing my part of the conversation to get onto the thing you want to talk about or even just your ability to retain what I said. Sure, I can speak to a therapist, but that therapist can only a lot an hour each week, and their recall is limited to me as one of their many clients - AI, however, never sleeps, has no self interest and is always open to conversation.\n\nMeanwhile, I’ve been archiving information since I was in elementary school. Collecting handwritten notes and then the emails that I started writing in the early 90s, cataloging and labeling old photos within digital and other stores I never had much interest in keeping a journal because the problem with journals, as you have to read them, you can’t ask them questions, you can’t access the data , it’s just an input mechanism, it doesn’t really have search or export capabilities. But AI does. It lets you know a lot about who what and where you are at a given time and frankly, I think it has the capacity to understand you better than almost any human.\n\nThe difference, of course is the ability of AI to interact in meatspace and to run into and accommodate disagreement, improvisation a d tangents, etc.\n\nEven this post I’m writing now. Why am I writing it in the first place? Maybe there will be a little discussion, maybe there won’t, with people I don’t know and will never meet.

I have no problem with people just not wanting to talk and therefore not initiating an interaction. \n\nHowever, there are *so many times* when, for example, someone will ask me on a date, only to have nothing at all to say during the date. They just sit and stare at me like a stunned mullet while I desperately rifle through my repertoire of thoughtful questions and silly anecdotes at lightning speed. I end up feeling like a performer in front of an audience and, frankly, it really pisses me off. It's like \n... Why did you even bring me here?\n\nI'll leave said date thinking they didn't like me, only to get a follow up text a couple of days later saying, \"Great to see you! We should do that again! When are you free?\"\n\nWTF??\n\nMoral of the story: if you want someone's attention, have something to say and learn how to ask questions!\n\nEdit 2: Thanks for pointing out the typo in the title.

But the people who made those places matter? Total mystery.\n\nSo I built a little side project called **Street View Social**. It lets you:\n\n* search an address of an old home\n* add the years you've lived and create a guestbook (Like a facebook profile for an old home!)\n* leave it like a digital time capsule for others who shared that corner of the world and allow others to find you based on the years you've lived\n\nYou could theoretically connect with people from any point in time, as long as you remember the address. No more witch hunting social profiles, emails or google searches.\n\nIt's totally anonymous if you want it to be and it only uses the years you've lived to show publically. So even if you see someone who has their profile set to private to avoid doxxing, you can connect with them since you knew they lived there at that time.\n\nThe dream is that two folks who once played hopscotch on the same sidewalk might stumble onto each other again.\n\nIt’s completely free, takes no personal data, and I’m not asking for money. I just want to see if it sparks reunions. If you’re curious or want to stress test it, here’s the link:\n\n[https://streetviewsocial.com/](https://streetviewsocial.com/)\n\nIf you check it out, let me know if this idea cool or cringe? I can handle brutal honesty.\n\nEither way, thanks for reading and for keeping the nostalgia flame lit. Hope you find a long-lost friend today.",

Walmart has mentioned the most which makes sense as Walmart is notorious for treating its suppliers, employees, and customers very poorly.\n\nThey have very low prices, but at a cost\n\n\n\n\nUPDATED UPDATE:  it’s crazy to me that over quarter 1 million people have read this post and so far over 1200 of commented. My post was a personal statement with the hopes of getting people to think. It’s not a hill to die on.\n\nAs is true with most social media, most of the responses are anonymous, negative, poorly thought out, rude, and irrelevant. There are some themes that run through the comments and a few really well thought out statements. \n\nThis is not about being anti-technology, anti-progress or anti-change. Self check out simply shift the labor which uses the same technology from store staff to the customer.  Many of the stores then reduce paid checkers thus creating artificially longer lines making self check out more attractive as It is faster. \n\nWalmart is mentioned very frequently and why anyone feels they can go to a store noted for discount pricing, poor treatment of suppliers, vendors, and customers and expect good service is beyond me. \n\nI just came from Costco, which does have self check out. My Costco also has relatively short lines for cashiers with two paid staffers at each register. \n\nTo help make the lines move faster they now do pre-check out: as you wait in line, they scan your membership card scan every item in your cart and when you get to the register, all you do is pay as they box your purchase (if you’re like me, my credit card is attached to my membership card so all I do is hit one button ). This is an excellent example of innovation and using a newer technology or revised technology to speed up the process and make the experience better for customers and no doubt for checkers.\n\nYes, they had to add staff to do this. But they’re also known for their low prices. The average wage of a Costco checker where I live is $23 an hour which is above the minimum wage. \n\nApparently, there are ways to improve service, customer experience, all while keeping prices low ",

      "selftext": "An older man (68+) and an older woman (68+), probably married, were in the same section of the hardware store as I was. He was verbally aggressive/abusive with her. At one point she “fell” (quotes bc I didn’t see what lead up to it) and he literally picked her up by her neck and jerked her around once she was up. He took a piece of molding and jabbed her with it, telling her to “git”. It’s a bit jumbled in my memory, was horrified and may have been in fight/freeze mode. I don’t know if I said something or was just staring with venom, at one point he got in my face and very aggressively said something along the lines of, “she’s in the early stages dementia, you better pray this doesn’t happen to you.” I responded (also aggressively, also in his face), “no kidding.” \n\nMy thoughts were to try to get a store associate’s attention. I only managed to get another woman’s attention. I don’t know if I said something or was looking around wildly in distress. She came over and talked to the older woman and helped her fix a measuring tape (the older man had assigned this task to the older woman). Every time the older woman looked at me, I tried to make my face warm bc what else could I do? (Really, what else could I have done? Wrapping my hands around the man’s neck seemed like a gratifying but bad idea. Would like some advice so I don’t mess this up again.) F*ck. \n\nMy thoughts were: what if this is her only means of support? What if this is the best she can get? A friend who briefly worked at a local care facility says they are beyond abusive - that may be a local issue, idk. What if I did something to make it worse for her? What if something I did enraged him and he takes it out on her when they get home? This is what he was willing to do in public, what is this mf’er doing behind closed doors? \n\nAt the check out counter, the older couple were two places ahead of me. He was flirty and charming with the cashier and the customer between us. When they left and it was my turn to check out, I asked the cashier if they came in often. She said everyday, sometimes twice a day. I told the cashier that I saw him he being abusive. She said I was mistaken, that he takes good care of her. I elaborated, the cashier said it must have been a joke. I said it wasn’t and to please watch out for her. (Yeah, I know, not her job. I really didn’t know what to do.)\n\nI can’t fix how I responded. I would really appreciate some advice on how to handle this better if it happens again. ",

We had good moments but There was a lot of verbal and physical abuse at times too. I loved him dearly , but he caused a lot of chaos in my life . So I’m grieving weird & conflicted . I had seen him 5 days before his murder after being no contact with him for three months after he showed up to my job trying to harass me. \n\nI have went though the motions of everything all week, including crying nonstop, loss of appetite, etc. I am now starting to accept the reality that’s he’s gone but I’m not sure if me attending the funeral and seeing him in the casket and them closing the casket on him might not be good for my grieving process and mental health. I don’t want the day of the funeral to constantly replay in my mind, as I live in my head alot .  I don’t want to regret not going but I also don’t want to take steps backward in this process of grief. I feel like him reaching out to me randomly after three months of no contact and seeing each other and actually being cordial was his way of saying goodbye subconsciously so I do feel somewhat at peace with that being our last interaction. \n\n I have not met any of his family members in person and only have talked through a couple of them over the phone before.  Is it wrong if I don’t go? \n\nI’ plan on buying a flower for the funeral regardless but yea . Idk what to do",

How did you practically/emotionally prepare for entering a new season with your parents as they age?\n\n2. Have you found anything that helped slow the decline of/reverse signs of aging?\n\n3. At what point do you need to say something about their driving? (I don’t think we’re at that point yet, but I’m worried about the day I might need to talk to them about driving less or not at all - both of my parents are fiercely independent and frequently out and about. I don’t want to wait until they’re in an accident, but I also don’t want to stop them from living their lives)\n\n==\n\n(Edit) Thank you so much to everyone for sharing your stories and advice.",

Once it's all filled out, I hope to be able to weigh the data points and create a \"desirability\" score that factors in all other fields.\n\nOne criteria is climate, but I'm having trouble finding good data on international city climates. I would like the fewest possible number of data points that will tell us how pleasant it unpleasant it is to live in a specific area. \n\nI found a website called WeatherSpark which has a lot of data, but the data can be hard to interpret without looking at the graph. For example it has \"hot season\" and \"cold season\" listed, but it doesn't define what the temperature cutoffs actually are.\n\nI also found a us government site that lists the number of days above 90f or below 32f which along with average humid days would be perfect, but we're trying to compare cities outside the US too which that site obviously doesn't have data for.\n\nDoes anyone have an opinion on what 3-5 figures I can find for basically every major city in the world that would give us good data on how comfortable a city is?",

      "selftext": "I (34M) have been living in Washington for almost 10 years now. I originally grew up in North Carolina and pretty much fled my parents house as fast as I could when I was 18. I had a conflicted relationship with my parents but we still love each other and both sides put in effort. \n\nI’ve really enjoyed my life out here I’ve meet a wonderful girl that I want to marry. I love the life style the ocean the mountains and the woods so much. I’ve also got a decent job but it looks like it’s going to be impacted by the coming layoffs. \n\nMy girlfriend is from the east coast too and really wants to move back closer to her family  she is much closer with them and talks to them every day.\n\nMy Dad was diagnosed with terminal cancer about a two years ago while he will never be able to clear it he has responded as well as we could have hoped for and has a good quality of life right now. I’ve been making a lot more effort to connect with my parents but it’s hard to let go of the old trauma. And they are definitely looking back and reminiscing about a past that from my perspective was very different. \n\nEvery time I talk to my parents it’s pressure to move back every time I talk to my girlfriend about our future it is pressure to move back. But I am just get this tight feeling in my chest at the thought of it. I don’t want to stand between her and her family but I am nervous about how her family respecting my boundaries. I’m a private person and I have had to talk several times to my girlfriend about telling her family things about me that I only ment for her. She is understanding but it is hard for her to not include her family in everything. \n\nIm at a loss I know I need my space but I also want to be there for the people I love and care about \n\nI’d be curious to hear some outsider thoughts. \n\nUpdate 5/13/25\nThank you everyone for your perspective. It seems like the consensus is I should listen to my instinct but I swear the feeling changes each time I think about it. \n\nI have been in this relationship for 7 years and she is the most amazing person I have ever met. We talked for a while last night about my fears and my trauma and she understands and is sympathetic, but at the same time moving back is her priority. We are talking about trying options in different states on the east coast that could have some buffer room in. But right now it’s not clear.\n\nAfter reflecting on the conversation I feel that it was very me oriented which is not inherently a negative but it just leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I also wonder if I am embodying some of my parents behaviors that have caused me trauma. I have felt that they have weaponized guilt and when I look at the what I am saying and how I am framing it I can’t help but see parallels. I want her to know how I feel but that comes at a cost. This hurts her because she wants what is best for me too and will feel guilty for pushing what she wants. There is also a part of me that doesn’t want to let this trauma continue to dictate my life. I have given so much to it I am tired I want to forgive and move on. \n\nWe brought up boundaries and she says she will try but her mom can be a steamroller(a very nice steamroller).\n\nOne last thing I have worked hard in my life to try and get the things that I wanted and when I have achieved those goals I have found that the reality did not settle the discontent. How can I know that this idea of staying in Washington won’t turn to ash when she is gone? \n\nThank you so much for your input I have a lot to think about. ",

So I feel like a pinball being bounced back and forth between two completely different ideals. And I do this with a lot of things, being wholly indecisive. I've saved up a good bit because of my indecisiveness but I struggle to know what to do with it.\n\nHow do you all know with your whole heart that you want to do something and then deal with the opportunity cost of losing out on other things?

      "selftext": "I’ve been carrying this for years, and it’s getting too heavy to hold in. My dad and his brother-in-law have had a long-standing conflict going back to around 2005. I don’t even know the full story, but whatever happened between them has affected how I’ve been treated by that side of the family.\n\nSince I was young, my cousins have been consistently rude—mocking me, ignoring me, acting like I don’t exist. I’ve never done anything to them. But because of whatever happened between the adults, it feels like I’ve become the target. And now, even their kids treat me with that same energy. It’s like this toxic behavior is being passed down.\n\nWhat hurts even more is that the aunts and uncles—the people who should be above all this—have also made things worse. They’re not openly aggressive, but they say things that feel like subtle jabs or emotionally loaded comments. It’s like they’re constantly reminding me that I don’t quite belong. I go home from family events feeling mentally exhausted and wondering what I did to deserve this kind of treatment.\n\nI’m an only child, so this hits especially hard. I always wished my cousins would be like siblings. Instead, I’m just the one who gets ignored or looked down on.\n\nCutting contact feels easier said than done—these are still family gatherings I’m expected to attend, and not showing up can create even more drama. My parents know some of what’s going on, but I don’t think they fully realize how much it affects me emotionally. I haven’t directly confronted anyone—it’s hard when the mistreatment is subtle and easily dismissed as me being ‘too sensitive.’\n\nI’m tired of holding it in. I’m tired of being polite while people chip away at my peace.\nHas anyone else dealt with long-term family exclusion or subtle emotional mistreatment like this? How do you protect your peace when you’re surrounded by people who make you feel like you don’t matter?",

Not drugs, not my moms thing. All tests (I mean a TON) came back fine. The only thing I've heard is Lewy Bodies Dementia, but I feel like they're just saying that because they don't have any other answers. Several nurses even said her symptoms don't add up to Lewy Bodies. \nI've been with her almost every second, watching this and helping any chance I could, only leaving a couple of times for showers and to maintain my own mental health (my step-dad stayed with her these times). Thursday she woke up in a miracle-like way, talking almost like normal and remembering everything (traumatically enough).  \nThe part that I'm needing help with is dealing with the sudden influx of certain people inserting themselves into the situation. My step-dad is telling EVERYONE, and even my ex-boyfriend just randomly showed up for a visit (he was turned away luckily). \nI'm not sure what I'm looking for with this post really. Advice? Commiseration? \nAnd, even though she's very very slowly regaining her ability to walk and is almost back to normal, has anyone ever gone through something similar? I'm completely lost, and wish most of the people that have felt the need to be a part of this would just back the fuck off. Her discharge cant be soon enough.",

His wife told him he's the reason why their family failed and his two daughters are harassing him with pictures of when 'he used to smile' but we're the ones who need to keep our mouths shut and I in particular am the bad guy because I asked if he needed help. He never interacts with us unless he needs something from us but he never gives anything back.\n\nMy family sucks. I can do nothing wrong. I apologize to them and they don't apologize to me.

Should Germany ban the AfD or not? I’m curios for your opinions and reasons.\n\nEdit: y’all need more context so here are basic informations: the AfD is a far right political party formed in 2013. AfD stands for Alternative für Deutschland (Alternative for Germany). The AfD was 2nd most voted party in 2025. The party leaders are Alice Weidel and Tino Chrupalla. Formed in 2013 as an Eu Critical, economically liberal and bational liberal it driftet off to be National conservative, Ethnic nationalistic and neoliberal. It’s known for wanting stricter immigration and degradation of social concepts (such as Bürgergeld). Members such as Björn Höcke and Maximillian Krah are right extremist (only Björn Höcke officially but Maximillian Krah is in my opinion too). They have contact to right extremist groups and thier youth club Junge Alternative (JA) is confirmed right extreme too. They’re also the only party that deny the human made climate change. Intern are trends with people who stand for anti feminism, homophobia, antisemitism and deny the holocaust.

      "selftext": "I'd love some advice from people who have successfully moved into a second career. \n\nI'm 40, and have been in the same industry since I was about 25. I am extremely specialized in one very narrow thing that is increasingly difficult to find new positions in (I'm in an industry that really feels economic downturns). I'm also beyond miserable in my current role. \n\nThe short term solution would be a new job (wish me luck with that, in this job market) but I'm also burned out on the industry itself. So I'm considering a switch to a new industry.  \n\nThere are a million things I'd rather be doing, but I'm stuck on the practicalities... I support myself, and I live alone. Quitting my job and going back to school just doesn't add up, in my head. \n\nHave you been through this? How did you stay afloat, quitting your job and going back to school?\n\nDid you retrain while keeping your current job? What program did you take and how did you balance things? ",

Why would you want either of those things?\n\nAnd more to your point about me not asking you questions, why can't you understand that maybe I'm a smart decent person, who understands that if such a private tragedy can strike my life, then maybe it can strike yours, in which case I shouldn't probe you with rude questions?",

I have way too many addictions such as fast food, Reddit, YouTube, Discord, pornography, masturbation, Instagram, etc. Porn and masturbation are my hardest addiction to break and I have been addicted to that since I was 12 years old. Porn and masturbation is very, very, very difficult to stop for me. I also dropped out of college as a third year junior student studying finance because I don't have any future there at all. I left with completing 75 credits out of 120 credits and a total of a 2.6 cumulative GPA with 5 W grades/withdrawals on my transcript. I dropped some classes and it wasn't worth it at that time. My own parents, siblings and even God himself hates my guts. I also developed some weird mental health condition that seems to make it harder for me to focus and develop a good plan for self-improvement for me. I am such a failure of a man. I don't even know how I am 25 and my life is this damaged. It's such a shame. I am so sad that I can't do anything. I was suggested to go to the military but that won't work because of medical history. I have this extremely weird depersonalization condition which is completely fucking up my cognitive functioning and making it harder for me to accomplish my goals in life. What should I do? ",

It's honestly worse than anything I've ever felt.\n\nI'm a writer and journalist and had this idea to talk with random internet strangers about their experience. I'm a bit inconsolable but something that's grounded me is knowing that this is one of the most universal emotions. When we break up, even if we're with friends or family, we still feel so, so alone.\n\nI don't want to just sit here and try to \"get over it\" alone. Something about the anonymity is fascinating to me. We always speak to people we know about heartbreak, but we never speak to people who know nothing about us.\n\nI process things through my writing and am hoping this could be an interesting experience.\n\nI pitched it to a major news publication and they're interested in it.\n\nGoal here is to do a little participatory journalism and see if two people who don't know each other can help heal. It may work. It may not. But I've spoken with 4 people already and it's been incredibly rewarding for both parties.\n\nIf you want to talk, it'll just be a 30–45 min Zoom call. Audio-only or video, whatever you want. You can stay anonymous. Nothing will get used anywhere unless you want it to. No names published. No audio used. Just text.\n\nIf this interests you, either comment or DM. Thanks everyone <3.",

      "selftext": "Thinking about trying to volunteer for a blue candidate in a deep red area.  \n\nFirst of all, this would be my first experience doing anything at all political except voting, posting on Reddit, and emailing Congress.  I’ve never even attended a protest (they don’t happen in my quiet country town).  I haven’t submitted an interest form on the website yet. \n\nThis would be a really big step for me.\n\nI don’t know how I could help.  I might be the only volunteer for the statewide campaign in my town — maybe in my county.  *Some* of my family would be understanding.  (Here, it is normal for your life to revolve around your extended family.) \n\nThe Democratic candidate is very moderate and is actually very aligned with the community’s values on issues — but people are used to voting Republican.  The local paper publishes Democratic vote count and IF I remember correctly there are usually under 10% of those voting in the whole county.  \n\nI’m kind of trying to consider what trouble I might run into.  My main support person would suggest not to be so public about something so controversial.  I would certainly have parental disapproval to cope with. \n\nThe candidate probably will not visit here.  Too rural, too deep red.  I don’t know what I could even do.  I’m actually rather introverted — but it’s a high-stakes race and I’m scared for another Republican to win it given how the nation is right now.\n\nWhat do you think volunteering would be like?  What should I consider before I send my name and contact info to the campaign?  I don’t want to tell the campaign people all my insecurities :/.  Or maybe they already know what it’s like in red districts.  \n\nI left out who the candidate is just so discussion of them specifically doesn’t derail the thread — not to be secretive.  \n",

I grew up lower-middle class, reused materials via arts & crafts, believed in eating food off floor with 5-second rule, etc.\n\nI finally landed a 6-figure job as an adult and I have 2 young kids. We live in a 2-story house (my freaking dream). I got a nice car recently. I eat more takeouts now and my kids feel like we can afford any toy even though I try to tell them thats not true and they shouldnt act like that. They dont seem to get it.\n\n\nMy habits have changed and it feels weird. My social circle has changed as well. People make jokes when I take leftovers home still but also have made comments that I can just throw that little piece of burger away or buy a new one. I used to cringe throwing food away. But lately I have done so and it feels weird cause....I guess I can afford new veggies now or something if it has rotted (I used to try to salvage even if half of a veggie has rotted and I just cut that part off).\n\nIdk what the point of this post is. I guess what I am trying to ask here is....how did you feel about that transition? If you have kids, how do you teach them to value money and other things (especially since your living situation proves otherwise that you are not struggling)?\n\nWhat is your belief in generational wealth? I mean, some people grew up rich already right? I didnt so idk how that feels therefore, idk how my children feels. It makes me wonder how generational wealth came to be and what did the first guy feel like, after working so hard and building a life for his future kids.....did they ever understanf where he came from? Or did all the future children and grandchildren just become bratty or spoiled or just simply dont get it (despite trying to understand) becausr they never had to scrap around for things and recycle water bottles for a few extra cents?",

      "selftext": "I've reached a point where if I want something I just get it or if there's a small thing needs fixing I just pay for it.\n\nYou know, if the roof collapses, the fridge dies, car breaks down, major expenses are another story, but simple things.  I want a book, a dvd, I just buy them.  Somethign sounds good for dinner, I can go out to eat or get it at the grocer.  I see a shirt I like I buy it.  Recently I realized that none of our utensils or dishware matched.  Over the years pieces got broken or lost and we replaced them with whatever.  But I thought, no, it's time.  So I got a whole new set of dishes and utensils.  Didn't even think about it.\n\nAnd I realized how wild that seems to me.  Once upon a time those things, any of them, they had to be budgeted for.  I had to save up.  Couple weeks, months sometimes.  Sacrifices had to be made.  Now...see, want, have.  \n\nI don't want to give the impression I'm a wealthy person, not by any stretch, but I've reached a point where I can pay all my bills and have enough left over that simple things are within my grasp and I don't have to worry if I can afford them.  \n\nI grew up so poor that sometimes, in winter, we had to alternate days of eating vs heating the house.  We couldn't always afford both.  Even up until a few years ago dollars had to be stretched, careful budgets maintained, I was doing the math at the grocery store for every item in the cart, it was check the bank account before any purchase to see if I could afford it.  \n\nI sat there last night thinking about that and realized \"This is my normal now.\"  Normal used to be other things.  Teenage me or child me, even 20-something would look at the me I am today and think \"he's rich!\"  And like I said, I am very, very far from wealthy or rich, but I am comfortable.  And me sitting here now with this level of comfort or security, to have come from the kid wearing a stocking cap and three layers with a parka to bed so he wouldn't freeze to death, it's a really strange feeling.  \n\nI may not be wealthy but part of me, it's weird, I almost *feel* rich.  Because someone in my position, what really is just normal for most people, was so far from anything I ever had or could barely imagine, that sometimes it doesn't feel real.  \n\nI guess what I'm saying is I may not be wealthy but I have more than enough.  And that was something I have never had before.  And it's a really strange feeling to in that position.  From nothing, sometimes less than nothing, to more than enough.  \n\nI only wish my mom was here to experience it with me.  She sacrificed a lot, she lived her whole life the way I always had and I wish I could have given her the kind of comfort I have now.  \n\nThere's some things money can't buy.",

Especially if they’ve been with someone in that time frame? \n\nIm 20m and she’s 20F we were together for about 2 years and basically lived together during high school she was my first love completely and she says I was also hers. TBH she broke up with me because I was insecure about things I shouldn’t have been after she’d spend months trying to reassure which is fair I was immature and I don’t blame her at all. After the breakup she stayed singer for a little over a year maybe a year and a half but after that she’s dated one man and from what she says only slept with him. She was with him for about a year and a few months which is a pretty long time, she said she loved him and maybe Im still not mature enough but that part gets to me sometimes. While she was with him she said she still missed me and they broke up a time or two because of it i also seen her checking up on me from time to time via social media so I know she’s not just saying it. She’s been broken up with him for like 2 and a half months which is quick so idk how to feel about that. Maybe I don’t know her enough but I don’t think she’s the rebound type. But now that were talking again were moving really fast and were talking about being together again. But I’m scared maybe the past is a deal breaker?? Especially because I’ve been stuck on her since the breakup and havent been with anyone else. It could also just be because I’m young and so that feels more important now. She’s all ive wanted for so long but now iam afraid to go through with it and make the wrong decision.",

      "title": "How I Learned My Procrastination was Caused by Depression",
      "selftext": "There was a time I couldn’t focus for longer than a few minutes, and every day felt like a cycle of procrastination, guilt, and self-blame. I figured I was just lazy or lacked discipline. But after diving deep into self-help content and going through dozens of therapy sessions, the real answer hit me: it wasn’t laziness - it was depression. I had chronic anxiety, and felt overwhelmed by even the smallest task. And every time I avoided something, my mind threw me into a shame spiral. If that sounds familiar, you’re not alone.\n\nHere’s the thing: a mentally healthy brain doesn’t run from challenges - it can handle them. But most of us chasing productivity are skipping the most important step: checking in on our mental state. If you’re constantly anxious, zoning out on your phone, emotionally eating, or stuck replaying old regrets, it’s not a discipline issue - it’s emotional burnout. That was me too. I used to stay up till 2AM, scroll all morning, and feel like I was wasting my life. Now, I get deep work done in the mornings, read daily, and have stayed consistent with workouts for over two years. What changed? I worked on my mind first.\n\nMy therapist also gave a bunch of book recs to me, and honestly, reading these changed everything. I still read daily (or book summaries when I’m short on time), and it’s one of the biggest reasons I’ve been consistent for a long time now.\n\n**- \"**[**The Body Keeps the Score**](https://www.befreed.ai/book/the-body-keeps-the-score-by-bessel-van-der-kolk/heart)**\" by Bessel van der Kolk**\n\nThis book will hit you like a truck. It shows how trauma lives in your body and how healing is possible. It’s dense but mind-blowing. Every page felt like someone finally explaining what was going on inside me.\n\n**- \"**[**Lost Connections**](https://www.befreed.ai/book/lost-connections-by-johann-hari/heart)**\" by Johann Hari**\n\nHari traveled the world to understand why we’re all so disconnected and burned out. This bestseller goes deep into the real causes of depression (hint: it’s not just chemicals). It made me cry, journal, and call people I hadn’t spoken to in years.\n\n**- \"**[**Unwinding Anxiety**](https://www.befreed.ai/book/unwinding-anxiety-by-judson-brewer/heart)**\" by Dr. Judson Brewer**\n\nIf your procrastination is rooted in anxiety (like mine was), this book is gold. Brewer’s approach blends neuroscience with mindfulness in a way that actually works. It gave me tools to stop the spiral before it started.\n\n**- \"**[**The Now Habit**](https://www.befreed.ai/book/the-now-habit-by-neil-fiore/heart)**\" by Neil Fiore**\n\nThis book changed how I view procrastination. Fiore explains that it’s not about laziness - it’s about fear, perfectionism, and burnout. He gives you practical tools to get into flow without self-hate. If you avoid starting things, this one hits hard.\n\n**- \"**[**Getting Things Done**](https://www.befreed.ai/book/getting-things-done-by-david-allen/heart)**\" by David Allen**\n\nThis is hands-down the best system for clearing mental clutter. Allen’s GTD method is used by CEOs, creatives, and overwhelmed people everywhere. It teaches you how to organize your brain so you can actually relax and focus. Game-changer for anxious overthinkers.\n\nIf you’ve been stuck and nothing seems to work, this might be your turning point. Start simple. Step outside right after waking up. Stick to a regular sleep schedule. Move your body - even one squat counts. Say one thing you’re thankful for. Learn something new every day, even just from a 5-minute video. It’s not about perfection - it’s about healing. Once you start there, everything else will fall into place.",

We’re financially secure, around $200-250k combined, but we both believe in making the most of life—money isn’t everything, and we don’t want to just live for retirement. \n\nHe’s a teacher, and I’m running a photography business that’s really taking off (in a good way, haha). The flexibility we have with our schedules is something we’re not willing to sacrifice.\n\nWe love the community here, but it’s geographically inconvenient. My family is in Ohio/Michigan, and just getting through DC on a road trip feels miserable. I grew up in a tight-knit town in Ohio, and I want that for our kids—bike rides, school events, and a strong sense of belonging, which I think our current area has. My husband has lived here in Southern Maryland his whole life, and while it’s comfortable, I think he’d benefit from experiencing life somewhere new. I was in the military and moved around a lot growing up—couldn’t imagine staying in one place my entire life! Travel is a huge priority for us regardless of where we live, too. \n\n  \nIt makes sense for us to stay and we recognize that. Just looking for advice from people that have been in our shoes. Our families/parents are all great, but are unable to give unbiased advice 🤣\n\n  \nAnyone really think we should take the jump and move? Why?\n\n  \nFor those that agree we should stay, how have you managed prioritizing travel while starting/having a family? \n\n\n\nLooking forward to hearing your experiences and advice!",

She's very outgoing and makes friends easily, whereas I'm pretty reserved and only have a couple close friends. She likes to be busy all the time and is a workaholic. I on the other hand really value me time and get burnt out easily. She's lived out of state for 6 years or so and comes to visit a few times a year. \n\nI've noticed the last few years she seems to wait till the last minute to make plans with me and it's usually just grabbing breakfast before she leaves town. She'll be in town for multiple days and have made plans for the entire trip except squeezing in a short visit with me. Normally I just say yes since my schedule is pretty flexible, but this last time I decided to decline since it always makes me feel like an afterthought. She'll be in town for 3 days but only has time to see me in the morning before she heads home. When it's the other way around and I'm trying to make plans with her it's almost impossible. I have to be extra flexible. \n\nShe calls me her best friend regularly and tells me how much she misses me. She also helped pay for me to renew my passport after she moved to Canada so it would be easier for me to visit. I'm just really confused and conflicted by her behavior and I have no idea how to bring it up, or if I even should. I've just been wondering lately if this is just us getting older and growing apart, or if I'm making a bigger deal out of it than it needs to be.",

I really like it out here besides the traffic, it’s been nice. \nBut my family back in MA are complicated, mainly my mom. She misses me to the point of guilt tripping me every second about coming back east and i know that she needs me. I’m her only child. \n\nWe lost my Nan last November and my mom and I had been taking care of her together right until I moved out, I’ve lived with them for 30years till I got this job. Nan passed and then my mom’s brother had a mental breakdown and I moved away. On top of all that she has to now leave the only home she’s ever known, so I understand why she’s hurting. \nMy family keeps saying that “you’re not responsible for her” “it’s not your job to make her happy” but idk how to ignore her pain or be the source of it either. \n\nMy mom still lives in my childhood home but they will be selling it so she needs to move and I also need to move bc my senior dog has been staying with her while i figure out a place of my own and how to get her here. \n\nI have finally done all that and it feels real now and it’s making my relationship worse with my mom. She’s been so depressed bc I’m taking my dog back too. \n\nI could move back east. My job is hybrid and the company actually has locations in CA and MA so I could transfer back east but the job would be more taxing and the hours would be a bit more ridged than my flexible ones currently. \n\nThat said, I I do have some pretty great friends back home that I miss. But I also have new friends out here too.\n\nI feel like I’m being pulled in two different directions. I want to stay here but I also want to go home.\n\nHas anyone else felt like this? I’m so torn I just don’t know what to do.  \n ",

If you are anything like me and are up-and-down on your knees, working on things, fixing things, finding things etc. these things are a huge quality of life boost.

      "selftext": "So basically, my life has been a rollercoaster ride of devastation and failure with pockets of hope and happiness. Bad home life growing up, single parent household and just really toxic, yada yada yada. I got in trouble with drugs a few times between ages 17-24, long story short I have 2 felony convictions for drug possession, 1 felony drug possession charge that was not a conviction, some traffic tickets, some paraphernalia charges, and a ticket for panhandling on my criminal record. This all ended about 10 years ago, and I haven’t had so much as a traffic ticket since.\n\nAt 24, I found another fucked up soul such as myself and we built a nice little life together. He works as an audio engineer and has helped me get into a job, but truth be told the job is really hard for me right now. I work in weddings, which was fine at first - but last year my soulmate was diagnosed with cancer. It was stage 2, but now it’s stage 4. Seeing these young couples with their whole lives ahead of them and these big happy families has gotten really, really difficult for me. My boss noticed, and demoted me to part time. I only make about $22k/year. I need to get out of this field and into something better. I’m just worried about whether or not I have a fighting chance in any industry with my colorful background.\n\nI know that he has about a 15% chance to live for 5 years. If he’s not surgically cured, we have maybe a year or two before he can’t work anymore, and he’s the primary breadwinner. I’d like to be able to take care of us both on my income when the time comes. Am I cooked? Is there any field I can go to school for that will accept me for my past, warts and all? I feel like I need to make a decision, but I’m frozen with fear and uncertainty. Choosing to invest in the wrong career path now will make my future worse instead of better. What should I do?",

      "title": "Memories working in an AIDS facility 30 years ago and the lessons I learned especially from one family of 4, that all died in my arms over the years. Mother, father and their two children.",
      "selftext": "Re-post from 2024\n\nI'm thinking this is as good as any sub to share this story. After my two sons were killed in the front yard by a drunk driver in 1989 I changed my focus from being a technical RN to becoming more of a supportive nurse. I became a Hospice RN and worked for the 3 years a local AIDS unit was opened. At the time HIV/AIDS was pretty much a death sentence, there was little treatment available. The hospital where I was working allowed nurses to refuse to provide care for AIDS patients. The nurses that would care for them were double loaded with extra patients. When the local facility opened I was excited to go and support the efforts. We started with 35 beds and advanced to 55 beds for AIDS patients before the unit closed due to lack of funding.\n\nOne family stood out. Supposedly the mother contracted HIV from a blood transfusion (who knows?), gave it to her husband and their baby who at the time was 1.5 years old. They had an older girl, maybe 5 or 7 years old who tested negative. Mom, Dad and the baby all were HIV positive. Mom was dying first. To give her daughter memories to carry with her though life, as the only family member to survive, we'd load mom up with medications so she could sit with her daughter who would visit after school and share a meal together. The smell of food would make mom retch, but we'd give anti nausea medications prior so she could leave her daughter with fond memories of her mom, eating and holding each other.\n\nMom died first, then the baby then the father. I was the RN for all of their deaths, they all died in my arms as the nurse caring for them, over a year or so. The facility closed, I lost contact with the daughter who moved in with her grandmother. Years later I was the RN for an inpatient Pediatric Hospice Unit with 10 beds for terminally ill children. The daughter, now about 10 years old or so showed up. It ended up she converted from HIV negative to positive. Testing wasn't as accurate back then as it is today. She was dying and lived with us at the inpatient unit about 2 weeks. She always wanted to be married so the staff pitched in and got what looked like a child's wedding gown, the girl was so tiny. Maybe it was a flower girl outfit, but it looked so pretty and she adored wearing it constantly. We cut the back of the gown so it would fit over her diapers and hospital gown and look so pretty. She'd admire the gown day and night.\n\nWhen she came in to the Hospice unit she said we should let her cat in. Grandmother said she had no cat but on the other side of the sliding glass door to her room sat a black cat looking in. We opened the door, the can came in and jumped up on the bed snuggling with her. She said it was Oscar and he was her cat. It's Hospice so what the heck, she loved him and so he stayed. At night he'd be at the door and we'd let him in, in the morning he'd leave and come back that night. The night she died, just after midnight, Oscar left and never came back. I wondered it that truly was a cat, or a spirt, an angel, her parents, whatever that came to support the little girl the last 2 weeks of her life, who outlived her family.\n\nThe love her mother had for her daughter, the dedication of Oscar, the joy the girl got out of the wedding gown, all have stuck with me for over 25 years now. It's not what you get it's what you do that matters. I treasure the loving memories of that mother, her family, the little girl, the staff I worked with to care for those children, the cat, etc all these years. The Universal flow of love doesn't come towards us, it comes through us, outward, to others, to the Universe itself.\n\nI made a short video on this family, it's very touching. I didn't want to die and have the story forgotten, here is the link.  Pod casters do not use my story on your channels, invite me on and I'll tell it myself. This is my experience and I want to be the one to tell it.  © David Parker Phoenix, Arizona\n\n[https://youtu.be/9coxdRkvBBk](https://youtu.be/9coxdRkvBBk)\n\nHere is the story of my boys that died ages 7 and 9 while playing in the front yard. A year later they came back and taught me a lesson I never forgot. I hope it has meaning for others.\n\n[https://youtu.be/vYRryRBefdg](https://youtu.be/vYRryRBefdg) \n\n\n\n",

She finally got admitted out on Friday but when we took her home and took her socks off to change them they had blisters called the hospital she was at and they said that they did not see she had blisters before she left. On top of everything the doctors at a new hospital which is better that I took my mom found she had a blood clot in her lungs which they said they caught early. Her heart still isn’t as strong as it should be it’s considerably weak even after the stents but the doctors say you need to give the body time after stents and medication to see how it reacts. But still it’s terrifying it’s like nothing is working for my mom and everything is getting worse. She just wants to leave the hospital and cries every night and it breaks my heart. I see her often, everyday in fact but I just miss the days when I’d get off work and she would call me on my commute home. And we’d call and talk about everything she got two new cats this year and that’s mainly what she always talks about. Or send me good morning and good night texts which I didn’t even answer sometimes but she kept texting me them 😞. My heart is breaking I just want my mom back. I’m only 27 and she’s only 53.

Every time I mention this to anyone, I end up getting berated and basically feel like a horrible person.\n\nEdit (Clarification): My wife and I both thought it would be nice to have a dog.  This dog is loved.  We're training him, he's working on potty training, my kids love him, he gets to run around outside on our farm, he sleeps in bed with us, he's still a puppy which makes it harder but even with all of this effort, there's nothing in return.  Given... there's not much return with a cat, but that's expected from a cat... because it's a cat.",

Also I've seen a ton of non-political subs become overrun by politics and the original point of the sub is lost. Often these kinds of posts are intentional misinformation campaigns. On the flip side I do understand how political issues effect people's lives and are an important part of being a grownup, and even those of us not in the US are unfortunately impacted by US politics.\n\nSo as much as I hate to suggest it, I think the best course of action would be to ban political posts here.

And aside from a few hangouts a year with our friends group, this guy doesn't get off his devices all day, every day.\n\nBecause his world is almost all online, he seems to not know anything else other than having to have a \"hot take\" on things.  And what's something that might be a time-waster or a distraction for most, like talking online about a TV show, a game, or a band, becomes the most serious business for him and he can't drop it when someone has a different opinion than him.\n\nMore recently he's started tearing away at real-life friendships.  After reading insane political posts online, he'll message people in our friends group (who don't discuss politics online or in  real life) things like \"You got exactly what you wanted!  Are you happy now??\"  As if he's using them as a way to respond to the online trolls he interacts with, and obviously it makes these people completely uncomfortable.  He's also messaged friends trying to confront them about perceived online rivalries he has with them, ones that they had no idea about.  \n\nIt's gotten to the point where friends have completely dropped him ( and honestly, I'm about to).  And it's sad because he was once an intelligent, sociable guy.  But being online every waking hour for over a decade has completely warped his behavior. \n\nA mutual friend reminded me that most people balancing family and/or professional lives are constantly having to compromise, having to take a pragmatic approach to things and understanding different perspectives.  Being terminally online paints a black & white \"us vs. them\" mentality that can erase all of that.",

I was jealous when I heard someone died by suicide on my local train station. \n\n\nI have friends with horrible husbands and the wives are still lovely to them. Unlike me. Horrible, mean and vicious. I deserve nothing and waking up everyday and looking in the mirror makes me sick. I just hate my self. I hate what I’ve done. I’m angry at me. I’m angry at the world. It’s NOOO excuse but if it wasn’t for the cancer then we’d still be together. It’s what happened around the cancer that led me to explode. Again I’m not excusing it at all. It’s all my fault and I own that and I’m ready to just end it all for that. \n\nEveryone else gets married and has beautiful times. I just had trial after trial. No honeymoon for us. \n\nI lost a fantastic man. I wish I just took him for how he is. sex isn’t important it’s not like I’m having it now anyway. I absolutely hate my existence. The hell I’ve been through throughout my twenties which include having cancer, a miscarriage caused by medication I was on as I was given incorrect advice and more. Now single parenthood. \n\nThe reality is that he was a fantastic man that I knew deep down was the one for me and I’ll have to cope with seeing him with a new woman and seeing my daughter bond with said woman whilst I continue to be alone. It hasn’t happened yet but I’m sure it will.   \n\nThe pros: he did a LOT for me including all chores. When things were good, they were great ( before all the trauma) \nThe cons: dead bedroom & his continued issue with my weight even though I lost a lot and was very slim. Unfortunately cancer meant I put quite a bit bsck on. \nHe initiated the divorce due to my very bad verbal abuse during pregnancy. I’m just busy watching every other friend my age moving into beautiful homes with their husband and baby having it all. The life I feel I was meant to have. I guess not. I don’t know what I did to deserve all my trauma but it’s my responsibility to react to it and I did horribly. I want to do work on my self but it won’t get him back. Almost feels pointless. What do you do when you’ve hit rock bottom and having to start over?? \n\nHe did so much for me and I know he has an amazing heart I’ll never be happy again. \nI know how much he loves me and I saw the love he had for me drain out of him all by my own doing.

      "selftext": "I'm looking for advice beyond just \"she's a toxic POS, leave\" that I mostly see here on Reddit from people who don't seem to realize that love is more complicated than \"jUsT lEaVe\". \n\n  \nA few facets to this story, I'll try to be brief:  \n  \nFacet 1: My gf and I have been together 10 years. For like 5 years or so we just stopped having sex. It's hard to explain why, we just kinda fell out of it and went so long that it became very awkward to bring it up. We were always affectionate, etc. just neither of us initiated sex because it just got kinda weird. \n\nWell, a few months ago she goes on a trip with her mom to Ecuador. And while there, she asks me if we can try having sex again. So it definitely was weird, but also awesome because we resumed our sex life and our relationship just got tons better. \n\nFacet 2: She's really into a certain hobby. And she starts buddying up with some people in Canada who are pretty high-level in the hobby/industry. And she talks about these people quite a bit, I know their names, etc. She feels really cool that she's \"in\" with these people. Most of them are men.   \n  \nFacet 3: Enter Donald Trump. She thinks he's turning the nation into a shit-hole. Like everyone else, she's worried about her own financial situation/security. I discover that she is looking at jobs in Canada. She's going there this weekend to talk to people. I confronted her on this. She says she probably won't move, has no concrete plans to do so, and wants me to join her eventually (she would have to be there for three years). She's signaling clearly that she wants me to be part of the plan. But she also wasn't telling me about it. She says she was going to, before she left this weekend. But she was withholding info from me so as not to unduly worry me over something that, she insists, is unlikely to happen. She doesn't think she will have the means to move to Canada and also not leave me in the lurch, which she insists she won't do. I don't make much money, even with a full-time job, and I pay a lot in student loans. I'm pretty poor, in other words.   \n\n\nFacet 4: I find out that one of the guys she's been talking to says inappropriate things to her. She told me this, because I saw a video of him on her phone (nothing gross) and I pressed her on it. She says that she's flattered by it and that she's having something of a mid-life crisis. She says that his attentions were instrumental in making her want to have a sex life again - but with me! I mentioned to her that she could easily close the door to this guy's \"inappropriate\" comments. She indicates that she hesitates to do that for fear of losing opportunities she thinks she could have with these industry players. She insists that she wants to be with me and only me, but she also won't firmly commit to telling this guy to cut it out. She justifies it by saying that his inappropriate behaviors led to use renewing our sex life. She saw it as a win-win-win, basically. And she saw it as a victimless crime as long as I didn't know about it, because this guy is so remote that nothing would ever materialize, so to her it is just a bit of harmless fun that makes her feel young again. She also told me, when I pressed her further on it, that she has reciprocated some of his inappropriate dialogue. I did not want to ask exactly how far it went. She insists they did not sext or have phone sex. The more I pulled up the rug, the more dirt I found there, so I'm taking that with a huge grain of salt.    \n  \nFacet 5: Quite a few years ago, she caught me in an arguably bigger lie, not about sex or anything, but a massive breach of trust. She struggled with the same trust issues I'm dealing with now. And she stayed with me despite it. So that's just to show that I'm not some saint, and she's not a villain. People are people. They make mistakes. They follow impulses. I want to give grace and understanding whenever I can. I want to be with her. But I also don't want to be gaslit. I made it clear to her that I can understand what she did and her reasons/rationalizations (I don't know how far it went) and I can forgive and move forward if she wants to. And she says she does. But I also made it clear that I don't want her fucking around with people on the side in any way. We're not married, we never made formal promises to be exclusive, but I told her I felt like that was the mutual agreement between us, and she agreed. And she agrees that she wronged me. But I still feel like there's part of her that doesn't want to deny herself whatever pleasure she's getting from interacting with this guy in this way, out of respect for my wishes.   \n  \nI'm really just looking for outside perspective on this. The ball is both our courts, it seems. For me, do I stay with her or not after this? For her, can she commit to being exclusive with me in the way that I've expressed I want?       \n\n",

I keep grinding, but nothing feels meaningful or guaranteed. I’d love to hear from others-how do you make peace with this? What keeps you going?\n\n\n\nIt's been a...pretty tectonic shifting past 6 months for me. I am currently in college and have recently pretty much fully tore away all the views I had on the world. I grew up in the LDS church (Mormon) and was usually an expansive thinker and had anchored my convictions on God being loving and stuff rather than the common narrative of the LDS church, but then my closest friend burned me real bad which was kind of the last straw in a series of events that had been slowly creating cracks in my worldview and that sent me on a spin reading stuff and talking to Chat GPT (which has actually been an amazing help).\n\nI feel like I see life for what it is now. Just a bunch of humans trying to create a semblance of something that matters but not really knowing what is going on. Love and close bonds feel ephemeral, nothing feels guaranteed. The systems we live inside are based on hundreds and thousands of years of history of human made constructs (money, religions, norms on what's right and wrong, norms on socializing and dating). I'm not here to spark any debate or get into that. Just sharing where I'm at right now and what feels accurate to the world/reality to this point in my life. \n\nI feel like all my attempts to connect deeply with people have just ended up hollow over the past 2 years I've been at college. I think deeply and feel I am very emotionally intelligent and love getting into deep conversations and connecting there but I have consistently found people have an inability to meet me there, don't care to, or are too biased or haven't introspected enough to dialogue on those fronts. This is kind of a hard thing to explain so if people want more context/examples I could give more. \n\nIt's also wrapped up in some spiritual pain and anguish that I have felt since I returned from my lds mission (which I have very conflicted thoughts on right now....it feels like I just did it without even having the knowledge or awareness to make a genuine decision for myself on whether I should go or not, but I still learned a ton from it). Where seeing things more expansively and put bluntly - contrary to what is normal in the lds tradition - had me getting judged, misunderstood, and seen as someone to fix in an area (spirituality/religion) that for some reason touches on the essence of one's soul and emotional landscape. This happened with some people that were very close to me (very painful) and various more surface level interactions. \n\nI also feel like the positive reinforcement for work and effort is not panning out. I feel like I've tried to be good and be positive to people and make friends, and have been doing college and did an lds mission and I'm still in the same grind. Still having to live with roommates who are not the cleanest and am moving around every 4 months (just college transience and what not), and have some financial dependence on my parents and with my recent shiftings feel more alone than ever in finding people to truly connect with and at least see the parts of me and support them that feel foundational to existence. \n\nNow I'm not saying all this as a sob story nor am I saying I don't have a lot of things to be grateful for. I have an amazing family who does love and care for me and accept me (and are willing to help with general life things) and I do have friends who care for me as well. I am very capable physically and intellectually and also living in America is objectively (on certain measurements) more privileged than many other places I could be living. \n\nThese things still don't do anything about the existential ache and loneliness I've been feeling with increasing intensity. That ultimately my life is mine to live. That no one is coming to save me. That a lot of the things I thought were more stable or could be relied on are not that robust. That it may just be the reality that I need to place the game of life and capitalism and get a job that I don't really want to do just to get by. That I may not find people who I can really connect with. That what is meaningful may not be anything at all or it may not be attainable. And that pretty much everything just requires work. It takes work to care of the body. To make sure the living space is in order. To do school or work. To upkeep relationships. To make sure I'm emotionally regulated so I don't just become an all out cynic. I'm not articulating well the expanse of all of it but maybe the point got across somewhat. \n\nI just feel like I was never taught or prepared for what life actually is like and now it feels daunting to figure it all out without any guarantee of anything. And I know there are plenty of ways to \"reframe\" this stuff and that while there are no guarantees there are some patterns and probabilities that generally hold true (for example - you treat people well, listen, ask questions, compliment them, etc, you'll probably get some positive response back. I could do this same exercise on lots of things). Maybe I need to hear some of these but I'm not sure it would hit home. But if I've learned anything it's that one can rarely be too open minded and open to uncertainty, so I'm open enough to leave space for being wrong there. \n\nAnyways I'm not really sure what I'm looking for. I just feel the weight of everything and just trying to move forward as best I can, but sometimes hope dwindles and I just feel the dense air of this all seep into my lungs and all I can manage is the bare minimum to not shoot myself in the foot and make my life a true shit show. Gosh if you read that all you are a saint lol. \n\nWould love any thoughts on this. Also I’m not looking for fixes or motivational cliches-I’m looking for real perspective from lived experience.\n\nSo for some others out there, what helped you keep going when life felt heavy, unrewarding, and uncertain, and no one was really holding it with you?

      "title": "Starting life at 30?",
      "selftext": "Hi, sorry if this post comes across as a bit disjointed, but I (28/M) am having a bit of an existential crisis (I'm in therapy and have a supportive family but figured it couldn't hurt to solicit internet advice). So to give a bit of background:\n\n* I graduated from a good state school (NY) with a BA in History & MENA Studies\n\n* Spent a year struggling and dealing with depression\n\n* Spent a year working a poorly paid customer service job for a vending company while trying and failing to find something better (while also struggling and dealing with depression)\n\n* Lost the job due to Covid and went to grad school for a year before crashing and dropping out (I got a really lucky/good deal so I was able to do so without incurring debt)\n\n* Worked a food services and bookseller jobs in the interim\n\n* Spent the last couple of years working a variety of odd jobs in remote polar research stations (station services/logistics etc.)\n\nThat about sums it up. The plan at the moment is to take a year off from the polar research station thing (I'm currently slated to spend the summer in Alaska working with sled dogs) before returning in 2026 for one last 10 month stint, then travel for 4-6 months before trying to transition into a professional career in NY (grew up/my parents live in a suburb of NYC) at the age of 30-31. I really enjoy what I've been doing but recently though, I've been having a complete existential crisis about how viable this plan even is. My aim is to try and transition into something either research focused (the dream job would be a research associate at a foreign affairs thinktank or investment firm) or something associated with my community. The concern I guess is the following:\n\nOverall, objectively, I know I'm not in the worst place I could be, I have a support network (parents who let me live in their house), I have ~$75k in savings, I have a variety of interests, foreign language skills, and have traveled to almost 30 countries but I see everyone I grew up with working really good jobs, living in their own places, getting married and meanwhile I've never had an actual full-time career (let alone one that I've found either meaningful or intellectually engaging), never (last two years aside) moved out of my parents house and have never been in a relationship (combination of the depression in my early 20s and recent career choice although I did go on my first date and have my first kiss two months ago). I just can't stop feeling like I'm significantly behind and haven't actually accomplished anything, and this feeling is just constantly gnawing away at me inside and it's preventing me from enjoying any aspect of my life right now because I'm just stressed that I'm making a mistake by not trying to get a full time job now (even though I also don't think I'd be happy if I gave up this next contract/travel opportunity). I think it's exacerbated because I've been staying at my parents house for four months without a job before my next job starts and between the (admittedly temporary) joblessness, social isolation (not many young adults in this suburb), and being in my childhood bedroom it's hard for me not to feel like a failure.\n\nSorry if that was a bit too rambly, I guess what I'm really trying to ask is: Is it realistic for someone in my position to try and enter the full-time workforce at 30+ and actually build anything resembling a successful life/start a family, even if I don't really have any meaningful professional experience?",

So, bring single, I am in charge or my check book, finances and investments.\n\nWhen I was married, in 1983, my husband was initially in charge.  When bills were being paid late and even the checkbook bounced once, I went to a community college to learn accounting practices which included balance sheets, check books and investments.\n\nIn such a short time I learned this stuff and got our train back on the track, which also drastically improved credit ratings.  My husband passed in 2012, and I have told this story many times and even now, I help some of my friends, who are in their 60s and 70s with their accounting and checkbooks.  I don’t even mention investments to them as I am not able by law to provide advice.\n\nI had to take charge of our family bills and such not realizing my husband was not trained or really interested. Nothing against him but, after talking with many friends and family members, I find that the wife, mother, mom can have a better handle on this stuff.  Of course, this was just in my family’s case.

He's a super family-oriented man (ironically this caused me some of the trauma i'll mention later), super patient and extremely smart. It's more of the way he responded to certain things that I can't forget.\n\nIt's just a slow burn throughout my childhood that I don't even know where to start. It's all the micro-incidents of poor parenting that add up. Maybe it was the way she only commended me for achieving something in school or looking good and never for just being myself or for doing good. Maybe it was all the times she dealt with our young helpless objections/disagreements with no other parenting skill besides \"i am your mother so listen to me\". The times we were always at loggerheads in my teens and instead of providing guidance and patience to a growing teen she responded with tantrums and guilt trips. The times I screamed until my throat felt torn because whatever logical argument i was trying to get through was just hitting deaf ears and deflected back with more victimization and guilt tripping. Until I finally learnt my lesson and never shared communicated deeply with her anymore. The time that she threw away my favorite toy when i was not around because she thought it was dirty and bad for my health and i refused to throw it and i came back from school, as a young kid, to find it gone. The times when she fat shamed me to motivate my size 8 self to lose weight because she's 4′ 11″ and a size 0 and has her own idea of 'big'. The year that i had severe cystic acne and she took me to so many treatments to help me but also told me it was ugly. All the times that she took care of us when we were sick but could not shut up blaming us about what we did wrong that made us sick - to the point that everyone in the family actively hides it from her when we fall ill. The time she acted super disapproving of my now-husband though she treats him like her own now.\n\nThe love and good intentions are abundantly there in all those examples but yet the suffocation of that love is also there. That's what tears me apart. Like i love and hate her.\n\nThe times when i occasionally bring up these faraway memories during dinners lightheartedly and just get it laughed off with a \"well you're just fine now!\" instead of an apology.\n\nI mentioned my dad is a very family oriented man. Yes and he subscribes strongly to all the confucian values like respecting your elders and parents at all times, keeping the peace in the family, blood is thicker than water, blablabla. So much so that on numerous occasions he admitted to me that he thought my mom was in the wrong but always ended it by saying i should let things go because \"she's your mom\". I never wanted anything more than a verbal apology. I never even wanted to even get my way. Anyway  he has a level head but i don't agree with some of his values.\n\nMy husband asked me once - i've dwelled on these for so many years, am i saying that as soon as they just say an apology i'll be healed? Well yeah!! That's all i want from them! A sincere apology, not one laced with guilttripping mind you. I want it more than any money and expensive meals they will readily give to us! And i will never get that!\n\nWe didn't have much socmed growing up, but now there is, and i can see many videos of good parenting and lovely familial bonds, on the streets as well amongst younger families. I can't see things like this without feeling purely happiness for them. I'm just filled with envy and resentment that i want(ed) this but it's just an unattainable dream. I hate feeling those things but they just swamp me.\n\nMy mom is a good person ultimately. She's not abusive and would never intentionally inflict suffering on anyone. She just doesn't have an ounce of logic and emotional maturity in her bones. Sadly that hasn't worked out too well for me since i'm a logic-first kind of person. I'm also acutely aware that she loves us a lot, more than herself probably. She gives us everything she can that she wanted from her own mom (who was a terrible person btw) which is attention, care and material things. She believed, rightfully, that we'd want the same and overcorrected on that.\n\nKnowing how her circumstances shaped her personality only makes me understand how she is, but it doesn't erase my own trauma. It doesn't make me like her more as a person.\n\nI feel sick that my love for her is entirely built upon guilt and gratitude but no respect. I don't want it to be this way but it is. Like I don't like/respect her as a person. Illogical, immature, homophobic, racist, judgemental, materialistic, the list goes on. Most importantly she doesn't listen. Some people can change for the better by opening their ears and minds to learn from different perspectives around them. But if you close that off you are never going to change or accept new things. She also goes through life mindlessly not knowing what she actually wants and also enforces it on me. Like one moment she's comparing me to someone else who had better career achievements and the next she's telling me how great it was that this girl found a rich husband and is now living the best housewife life. What is it that you want to teach me do you even understand yourself??? She doesn't understand her own superstitions because everytime i ask her to explain the specific consequences of defying them she has no answer. Her only parenting tactic in times of disagreement were just either enforcement or gaslighting  since we MUST follow her wishes because she's really scared to let us fail.\nI feel guilt. That she loves us so much and gave us the best care, that everything she does is in our interests, yet i appreciate her but i don't like her. That she probably thinks everything is fine but here i am with a bucketful of complaints. I feel gratitude. That fortunately we didnt struggle financially because i dont think i'd be sane today if i had to deal with finances AND a child of a mom. \n\nWhen i go back to visit my parents i do out of a guilt mindset. How sad would they be if i don't visit? I want it to be out of actually feeling happy to spend time with my favorite people but, i don't and they're not.\n\nAll of this boils down to our generation gap, or so i've been taught to believe. Different gens different environments, different value systems, different principles. Hence all the trauma i imposed on myself because i just have a different set of values than my parents. I cannot bring myself to see eye to eye with them and neither can they truly understand me. Like how i mentioned i want nothing else than a verbal apology for incidents  or at least some verbal acknowledgement that they could've done better. but for them they can do EVERYTHING to treat us better and show it in action but not say it. And i hate that I can't just make peace with that and accept the way they are and laugh and joke about it. My siblings do that perfectly. \n\nSo this negative view I have about generation gaps. It's part of the reason why I don't want kids. Obviously one will have a generation gap with their kid. I'm convinced that history will repeat itself and now i'll become the parent unable to understand my child and unable to parent them well and subject them to a lifetime of trauma. Become the parent they dislike and not look up to. \n\nI know that the emotional part of me wants a kid but everything else is dissuading me from it, from this trauma to our current world. Between the regret of not having one and the regret of fucking things up with one i will choose the former. \n\nNow my absence of children has caught up with me due to the immense pressure from my parents. Another thing that annoys me - their claim that having kids is the most fulfiling. Um sure - you mean for yourself? At the cost of the kids' trauma? Like you did with me? And you're pushing me to have kids when i was dissuaded from it thanks to you??? Make it make senseeeeeeee.\n\nEnd of rant.\n",

As we all know, life sometimes gets in the way and in my case this was so.  My son was born when I was 27 and spent my life ensuring his life, education and well being were my primary focus.  He later went on to become a medical doctor and I am extremely proud of his accomplishments both professionally and personally with his family.\n\nI was 52 when my husband passed and should have gone back to school to keep my mind busy and from falling into a depression.  I did not and used my mind and talents into becoming a professional photographer as well as an editor in chief and a writer.  I retired at 64 from my responsibilities as editor in chief and now work as a photographer selling photos.\n\nI always have the regret of not getting my PhD realizing that my age is now against me even though I could do it now just for personal achievement.  I really don’t want the stress as I am now enjoying life in Maine and traveling.  Am I being too petty?  What are your thoughts and what regrets have you dealt with in your life?",

Career-wise, I work in a high paying field and I’ve been promoted after 2 years at my job and I’m considered a high performer. On paper, things are good.\n\nBut emotionally? I feel like a failure. Not in a dramatic, spiraling way — more in that low-level, dull ache of “this can’t be it.” I used to be a high achiever in school and in extracurriculars. I always believed I was destined for something more — I know how self-centered that might sound. I think part of it is growing up with immigrant parents and internalizing the pressure to be exceptional. Oddly enough, my parents are proud of me and don’t put any pressure on me now. It’s all internal and I feel like I can never rest and should always be striving for more to the point where I feel guilty relaxing. \n\nI have friends. I go out on weekends and enjoy the work I do. On a global scale, I’m doing better than many and I know I should feel grateful. And yet, I feel like a cog in the machine. Like life is becoming a long string of “is this all there is?” I know the feeling is valid and almost cliche, but part of thinks I should be ashamed of feeling this way because I don’t have it bad.\n\nHow do you deal with that? How do you accept — or maybe even find meaning in what feels like a very ordinary life, which I know isn’t a bad thing.",

      "title": "Don't Wait Until It's Perfect (5 Lessons I Learned)",
      "selftext": "For many years, I thought my problem was a lack of motivation. I’d buy planners, make detailed schedules, and research every possible strategy for success. But when it came time to actually do something, I would stuck in freeze mode. My brain convinced me I needed the perfect plan before I could start. The best workout routine, the ideal investment strategy, the right time to learn a new skill. But that time never came. I wasn’t planning. I was procrastinating, dressed up as “being prepared.”\n\nThen, one day, I tried something different: I acted at 70% readiness. I stopped overthinking and just did the thing. And it legit worked.\n\nHere’s what I learned:\n\n1. Perfectionism is just fear wearing a productivity mask.\n2. You don’t need more information. You need action.\n3. Clarity comes from action, not before it.\n4. Small, messy steps beat perfectly planned inaction.\n5. “Not ready” is just an excuse. You’ll never feel fully ready.\n\nMy therapist also threw a bunch of book recs at me, and honestly, reading these changed everything. They made me realize just how much my brain was sabotaging me, and how to work with it instead of against it. Here are some books I found really helpful.\n\n**\"**[**The Now Habit**](https://www.befreed.ai/book/the-now-habit-by-neil-fiore/heart)**\" by Neil Fiore (messy action is okay)**\n\nThis book made me rethink everything I knew about procrastination. Fiore explains why we avoid tasks and how to break the cycle using the unschedule. I believe it will be a game-changer for anyone who struggles with motivation and it’s the best book I’ve read on overcoming analysis paralysis.\n\n**\"**[**The Molecule of More**](https://www.befreed.ai/book/the-molecule-of-more-by-daniel-z-lieberman/heart)\" **by Daniel Lieberman (stop waiting for motivation)**\n\nReally good read. It explains how dopamine tricks us into chasing ideas instead of execution. If you always feel excited about a plan but can’t follow through, i definitely believe you should start reading this one first.\n\n**\"**[**The Confidence Gap**](https://www.befreed.ai/book/the-confidence-gap-by-russ-harris/heart)\" **by Russ Harris (action builds confidence, not the other way around)**\n\nThis book changed my view on fear. Harris explains why waiting to “feel ready” keeps you stuck, and how to act despite fear. If you overthink every decision, this is a must-read.\n\n**\"**[**Four Thousand Weeks**](https://www.befreed.ai/book/four-thousand-weeks-by-oliver-burkeman/heart)**\" by Oliver Burkeman (set lower expectations \\[seriously!\\])**\n\nThis book humbled me. It’s about how we’re all running out of time, and trying to optimize life is actually making us miserable. Burkeman argues that accepting limitations makes you more productive, not less.\n\n**\"**[**Tiny Habits**](https://www.befreed.ai/book/tiny-habits-by-bj-fogg/heart)**\" by BJ Fogg (reduce the friction)**\n\nThis book is the opposite of hustle culture. Instead of “just do it,” Fogg explains how to make habits easier. I used his method to build momentum in small, stupidly easy ways - like doing one push-up or reading one page. \n\nIf you’re stuck in overthinking mode, ask yourself: what’s one thing you can start today at 70% readiness? It won’t be perfect, but it will be real. And real beats perfect every time.",

In college, I wanted nothing more than to move to a big city and live my queer life out. I did that 5 years ago, and I truly love where I’m at. I have a great job, fiance, home, friends, and I’m a part of various groups/clubs that keep me busy. \n\nHowever, I miss my family so much. I struggle to call often because I miss them, and then cry when I leave my hometown or they leave from visiting. I see other people my age (late 20s) who have moved across the country as well and they seem perfectly fine. No one complains or seems to be homesick, and I get that social media isn’t meant to show the sad bits of life. I genuinely just don’t know who else feels this way to talk about it with. \n\nAny words of advice or just feelings that relate? I feel constantly conflicted, I cannot see myself back where I grew up and I can’t help but wish my family would just move to where I am. It turns into this confusing guilt I give to myself, which I think really is just me being sad. Why was I not warned that homesickness is not just something for college or sleep away camp? \n\n\nEdit to add: The stories shared here have brought a tear or two to me. Thank you all for helping me feel less alone and more normal. Gotta fight for the lives we love and deserve❤️",

      "selftext": "I saw myself getting into the bad habit of doomscrolling, but I still do it, mindlessly. I notice the craving when I want my mind to quiet down from all the thoughts. Such an addictive habit.\n\nI don’t have kids, but I see what is happening to my nephews. My sister would give them a tablet to watch things to calm them down at the restaurant. They are hypnotized by constant stimulation and I feel this is not right. Too young for phones though and I have no idea how to handle it. they grew up with it, it is the norm for them to drown out noise by diving into shorts and reels. It made me recall my childhood when there’s no internet and mobile phones. I used to be able to just sit and stare out of bus windows for hours without a phone, just my thoughts. But now, every moment, every gap has to be filled with input. \n\nBut here’s the scary part: kids today don’t even get the chance to sit with their thoughts. They’re growing up in a world where silence is unnatural, where every moment has to be filled with input. And I genuinely don’t know how they’ll cope.\n\nWhen I finally went to therapy, I learned that doomscrolling It isn't helping, but instead of sitting with the discomfort of all these thoughts and problems, it provides the escape. \n\nSo I had to rewire my habits. And honestly? I wish I had learned these things as a kid:\n\n* Doomscrolling numbs discomfort, but it doesn’t make it go away.\n* Overstimulation messes with attention spans, making focus nearly impossible.\n* Giving kids a screen to “calm them down” teaches them to rely on distractions instead of self-regulation.\n* If kids never learn how to sit with boredom, they’ll always crave stimulation.\n* Social media is designed to keep them hooked. It’s not just entertainment.\n* Reading books rewires the brain for patience, creativity, and deep thinking.\n* If you want kids to have a healthy relationship with technology, delay giving them a phone as long as possible.\n\nMy therapist recommended some books and I’ve been reading these recently:\n\n[**The Anxious Generation**](https://www.befreed.ai/book/the-anxious-generation-by-jonathan-haidt/heart) **- Jonathan Haidt**\n\nThis book is terrifying. Haidt breaks down how smartphones and social media have fueled a mental health crisis in kids, leading to skyrocketing anxiety and depression. I recommend this to my sister and she is reflecting on her parenting styles after reading this.\n\n[**Letting Go**](https://www.befreed.ai/book/letting-go-by-david-r-hawkins/heart) **- David R. Hawkins**\n\nThis book teaches us how to sit with emotions instead of avoiding them. I wish I had read it sooner, it would have saved me years of numbing myself with screens.\n\n[**Stolen Focus**](https://www.befreed.ai/book/stolen-focus-by-johann-hari/heart) **- Johann Hari**\n\nIf you’ve ever wondered why attention spans are getting worse, this book will make you furious. Hari exposes how tech companies profit off distraction and what we can do to reclaim our focus.\n\n[**The Shallows**](https://www.befreed.ai/book/the-shallows-by-nicholas-carr/heart) **- Nicholas Carr**\n\nThe internet is rewiring our brains for short-term, shallow thinking. This book explains how and, more importantly, how to reverse it. A must-read for anyone raising kids in the digital age.\n\n[**Indistractable**](https://www.befreed.ai/book/indistractable-by-nir-eyal/heart) **- Nir Eyal**\n\nThis book teaches how to build focus and self-control in a world designed for distraction. Every parent should read it.\n\nWe can’t expect kids to have self-control when even we struggle with it. If you’re a parent, I beg you to delay giving your kids a phone. Let them be bored. Let them sit with their thoughts. Their future attention spans depend on it.",

Wife noticed that I'm burned out and suggested that I treat myself to a two or three day solo trip somewhere. So thoughtful! But I have no idea what to do. \n\nAlthough I love the idea of getting away from the kids and family responsibilities for a few days, I don't want to be totally alone; I wouldn't for example enjoy a solo camping/backpacking trip (I tried a solo backpacking trip once, and after 30 minutes alone at my destination camp I turned around and hiked back out!) and haven't learned how to enjoy solo travel/sightseeing. My few friends are all still working and dealing with family responsibilities so I don't think I can arrange a trip with friends. So what's a thing to do/place to go where I'll be around other people who are open to some light socializing and where it's not weird, perhaps it's even typical, to be solo?\n\nI don't do sports of any kind, so something like a weekend tennis clinic is right out, though the basic idea of a fun/educational weekend with a group of like-minded people sounds great.\n\nNorthern California, but could take a short flight somewhere.\n\nLooking forward to any ideas that people would throw my way!",

They also tend to belong to many other old T.V./movie subs, and nostalgia subs as well.

But my whole life, I have felt mentally exhausted, but it feels so much worst lately.\n\nI grew up being in gifted programs in elementary school, took AP courses in highschool (even a 5am course while doing after school track and I thought I was about to fall and die from exhaustion), went to college and double majored. Not to mention asian parents here whooping me to do better.\n\nAfter graduation, I was shortly accepted into a very respectful corporate job BUT THE EXHAUSTION DOES NOT END THERE.\n\nThey want new project ideas every year!\n\nDue to certain circumstances, I went back for my Masters. And I also switched jobs. But now my new job's department is restructuring the entire team and STARTING FROM SCRATCH. They told me I have free will to utilize all resources to get projects starting.\n\n\nYou see, it's not just school, but also work life as well. I feel like I have to constantly keep up with business practices, the news, scholarly research, find new solutions nonstop.....it's now affecting my personal life to the point I havent even done taxes yet for this year cause I'm too overwhelmed to think about gathering the forms (even though i have always done taxes the moment it opens). Chores left undone, almost forgot to do simple kids stuff like order the school pics or get them ready for field trips.\n\nI feel like because I'm overwhelmed so much, I'm falling behind overall.\n\nBut.....some people live like this right? Especially scientists, researchers, or scholarly professors constantly learning something new everyday right? (Not that I'm calling myself that but there must be a way on how they cope)\n\n\nLong story short, what do you do when you're so overwhelmed to the point you want to throw out your whole schedule? (But you cant cause theyre important and must be done anyways). When I walk outside, I feel like I should let my foot slip and fall and just crash on the sidewalk. I want to let my brain die.",

      "title": "Would You Move Closer To Your Own Parents or Spouse's Parents",
      "selftext": "My wife and I (late 30s) are moving with our 3 year old daughter about 2 1/2 hour car drive from current location. Lower cost of living and better job opportunities. \n\nWe told both sets of parents this. Immediately, my wife's parents made the decision to move where we are going. For reference, both sets of parents are currently 10 minutes away from us.\n\nAnother note, my sister live about 30 minutes from we where are moving. My wife's sister and their child lives 45 minutes away. So we are technically moving closer to family.\n\nThe caveat, however is that my dad has stage 4 parkinsons. We offered to move him (and my mom) closer to where we (and my sister) are going to be. He would be for it, however my mom is his primary caretaker and refuses to move. She has a lot of friends and support up here but I am trying to convince her that both her kids will be closer together and grandkids as well. It's a two and a half hour care ride from my parents when we move.\n\nBut my daughter is just naturally closer to my wife's parents. Partly because my own dad is sick but also my wife's mom makes more of an effort to play and interact with our daughter than my own mom does.\n\nI hope we are making the right move. My daughter will just be closer to my wife's parents but I just know my dad won't be around much longer and my mom doesn't want to move. She has friends up here, but I think she would also appreciate being closer to both set of kids and grandkids when my dad passes.",

      "title": "I'm Turning 37 Next Month.....and I'm Nervous",
      "selftext": "In about six weeks, I'm turning 37, which means I'm closer to 40 than not and officially in my late 30s. I knew 35 was a turning point, but we're officially out of the mid-30s and into the late 30s, and now I'm staring down the barrel of 40. But I have a problem.....\n\n  \nThis is going to sound dumb, but I always figured that my life would be sort of done by 40. Like, 40 is the time to go home, sit down, and quietly wait for retirement and death (hopefully in that order). \n\n  \nI just got out of a rocky five-year relationship. I don't want kids and can no longer have kids anyway. I've had fun being a great uncle to my friend's kids (I'm an only child, so no siblings)\n\n I never thought I would be single at this age. I know that dating at this age is pointless. The 30s dating sub is so depressing. I'm a guy, so I suppose that I could date younger, but I can't have kids, so that seems like a bit of a crapshoot. Things with my ex were complicated, but I might have to go crawling back to not be alone....I don't know. That's a mess. \n\n I'm a content creator in the news and politics space, and my business is just starting to take off. I've been involved in another media startup that is gaining traction. I'm building a podcast network, too, with that same company, and we're getting ready to fundraise and attract investment. \n\nIt just seems like it's over. Like, life is done, and all my hopes and dreams are just flushed down the drain because I didn't do it in my 20s.  On the one hand, I've lived this crazy amazing life and travelled, made art with people, and worked on amazing projects, but it never led to a job or financial stability. It didn't leave much time for a relationship or real living. My work has been my life this whole time. I always felt a sense or urgency to \"make it.\" The older you get, the less people care about personal success. It's like, I'm starting to become known, and more people are following me, but I'm almost 37, so who cares? There's an army of Gen Z and Gen Alpha kids that have way more significant followings than I do, and they are younger, better, faster, and prettier and have the energy to enjoy being successful. \n\n  \nI always imagined success as nightclubs, early airport mornings, exotic destinations, and great friends. But that's not a thing now, and to be honest, after 2 Covid infections and 2.5 years of long Covid, I don't think I could even manage that. I missed out on many fun things like music festivals because I was mostly a broke artist who could never find a good job or stability, so I worked a lot, and most of it never became any kind of success, and I missed out on having fun. I had fun along the way, but I had bigger designs. It just feels disappointing. I haven't been on anything I could describe as a vacation in years. I've traveled for work, work events, artist-in-residency opportunities, and family, but nothing that was just fun and relaxing. I haven't been to a beach since I was a kid. My life has been crazy and amazing, but it has definitely lacked downtime, relaxation, and a lot of the fun stuff I've heard about. My ex really wanted us to go to this sex resort in Jamaica, and I would have loved to go, but I never really had the money for that. And that doesn't even get into losing momentum on my business because I'm not big enough to hire a staff to do all the stuff. It sucks and its part of the reason we broke up. I wasn't offering the kind of lifestyle she was interested in. Fun with me was late-night conversations after another exhausting day of running two businesses and trying to have my breakthrough moment that makes it all worth it. \n\n  \nI was reading some posts earlier about this, and everyone was like, \"Life is great. I'm really into mountain biking and my dog,\" or \"yeah, I'm finally settled down with kids, everything is great.\" I can't ride a bike and don't want to. I don't want to spend the rest of my life hiking, going to doctors' appointments, and attending funerals. I don't want to \"focus on myself\" and such. I don't want to \"find a new hobby\" or anything along those lines.  I want to rage at amazing parties in exotic locations. I want to rack up points on multiple airplanes and hang with the modern jet set. \n\nI want the life I envisioned when I was 17, but my logical brain says, \"That's not where you're at anymore,\" and yet my heart is like, \"Yeah............... I don't care.....I want what I want.\" It just doesn't seem possible anymore. And that makes being successful seem so pointless. I've spent my life building a business and making a name for myself so I can sit home and do what? Quilt? (No offense to quilters!)\n\nMy buddy is a world-famous photographer, and he thinks I'm absolutely nuts. He says that for creatives like us, 40 is when real success starts and when things finally get good. It just doesn't feel the same to me. It feels like failure because I'm already just too old, too past it, and instead of living the life I want, I will be sitting at home watching TV and waiting to get to the end of this thing... alone and sad. \n\n  \nI always felt such a sense of urgency, even when I was young. I lived fast, said yes to everything, and tried to find my thing. I never did, and I created my own, but now it feels like I just missed everything. \n\nIs there any hope for me? How can I shift my mind to be excited about turning 40 and not sitting at home just waiting to die? \n\n  \nTl;dr\n\nI've always thought that success in life and business only matters if you're young, and it feels like 40 is too old to be successful and enjoy it. I'm trying to figure out how to embrace this next aging phase. I'm still working hard, but I'm worried that it's going to happen to me, and I'll just be too old to do anything that I want to do because I'm not 25 anymore.  How do I enjoy success and embrace life when I'm at this age and stage of life? ",

      "selftext": "If you look back in my history, my husband started to be very unwell 2.5 years ago and was diagnosed with terminal cancer of the esophagus. He was given 8 to 18 months, 2.5 years later he's still here, having fought to push back the inevitable so our young children would have more memories of him. But it's been brutal, every time you think things are settled, bad news hits, you have to live with worse everything. Once you get used to that, more shit happens.\n\nAnyway, between that, working and looking after children, I've been tested (by life, I'm not religious) and got more resilient. The past 6 months there's been very little joy apart from my children. \n\nAvailable treatment for cancer was tried one by one until there is none left. He stopped tx around Christmas and was told it could be 2 to 9 months left. Since he'd exceed expectations before, I guess we both expected closer to 9 months. In fact about 1.5 months ago, he felt strong enough that when the opportunity came up to buy our first property, he said we have to go for it. So we did. Then 2 weeks later he started to deteriorate after a chest infection. All the paperwork involved, I got through it, while working and looking after children and him. He was not too bad. Spending all the time in bed but able to look after himself mostly. I just had to prepare meals.\n\nHouse sale is going through, we get the keys next week. But it needs work, we'll do minimum and move in about 3 or 4 weeks time. \n\nThen over the last week or so he got real weak, and getting up and walk to the toilet became a chore as he has to lean against walls at all time to prevent falling. Last Thursday he couldn't pee, at all. So trip to A&E and catheter was added. He's home but so weak. This morning he had horrendous pain on a shoulder so calls were made etc for advice on painkillers etc. Finally morphine did it's thing. I'm having to do everything, plus choosing carpet and paint and liase with house stuff, keeping children fed and husband fed and prepare tlfor the week ahead. My son ia autistic and although he has very minimal needs, one thing is food. So we always meal prep for the whole week ahead. Anyway all this is to say I can't really skip making good meals. Now husband also needs his own food.\n\nI'm drowning. I know things will improve eventually but right now I'm drowning. I have friends but tricky for them to really help. My cooking for family needs to be particular for reasons stated above. They can't help with husband or any liaising with various people re house. So here I am. I wrote this reddit post in bits and pieces on my phone so it won't flow well but I don't have time. I'm not sleeping well and tired and headache a d and struggling. Tomorrow I plan to set up things before I leave for work, come home at lunch to take him for ct scan then go back to work. Worried about cancelling days off work as if I don't work, I don't get paid. Plus I don't want to lose my job as I will be taking more days off for house stuff and when the inevitable happens. \n\nAnyway I have learned from the past 2 years that I won't buckle. I will get up every day to do what's needed and with a smile for my children and at work. My children are so happy and they need me. If something happens to me they'd be orphans since we don't have family or friends close enough or able to take on 2 children. I WILL absolutely carry on for them. What I do need is for people who have been through similar to tell me something, I don't know what. This too shall pass? Thank you for reading. I feel better already. ",

      "selftext": "Day before Procedure - Unexpected Surgery\n\nHi,\n\n  \nI saw an ENT a week ago today and we went over my options. I've suffered with awful allergies my entire life and snore so loud that my kids on the opposite end of my 2k square ft house can hear me even WITH ear plugs. I stop breathing in my sleep, but I do not have sleep apnea according to my sleep study. I am 25.\n\n\n\nI did a Laryngoscopy in office and while he saw that my tonsils are slightly enlarged and I have a deviated septum, he doesn't know why my snoring is so loud. He told me I had a few options: undergo a nasal endoscopy where he puts me to sleep so I snore and they have me swallow to see what is going on or just go ahead and try taking my tonsils out. He said he doesn't know if taking my tonsils out will work, but it's an option. I said I wanted to do the nasal endoscopy first, but later, I saw that in the visit summary it stated that \"patient is hesitant of nasal endoscopy, will proceed with adenectomy/tonsillectomy\" and got the call today from the clinic confirming that I will have the nasal endoscopy and adenectomy, but the estimate includes an estimated bill for adenectomy and a separate one for a tonsillectomy. I've met my max out of pocket for the year so money is not an issue: medical procedures are free (yay chronically ill and medically complex family!). This part is off topic, but he recorded me as AOX3 and that hurt my feelings. \n\n\n\nSo... I guess I have that going on tomorrow. I was not prepared for this, but I'm not against it, if that makes sense? Can I hear everyone's experiences with both procedures? I have to be there at 5 and the surgery is scheduled for 8 am. I have class at 9 and then again at 2. Was anyone able to go from their procedure to class/work? What was your recovery like? I was told I wouldn't need any type of pain management after, but told I could have Tylenol if needed and the recovery is a breeze. He stated that I should avoid social media and googling because most info about this is wrong and \"people online are dramatic\". \n\n  \nUnfortunately for him, I have anxiety and am chronically online so I will ask my online community all the questions.\n\n  \nFeel free to unload me to all the info!",

      "selftext": "I’ve been dealing with a group of close friends for a while now, and things feel really unbalanced. I’m unsure if I should keep trying to fix the relationships or step back completely. Here’s a breakdown:\n\nMary and I have known each other since elementary school, but we became closer in high school and beyond. We share a deep understanding and support for each other, and our relationship is solid. There are no issues between us.\n\nAna and I have also known each other since elementary school, but we got closer in high school and beyond. She doesn’t share much, but I understand that’s just her personality.\n\nStormi and I met in high school and grew close after graduation. Our bond was strongest in 2022-2023, especially with Nina, but eventually, that closeness faded. Now, we’re more like acquaintances than close friends. Stormi and Nina have private conversations, and once, Stormi mentioned having “private convos” with Nina, which bothered me. When Ana, Mary, and I talk, Stormi makes faces and shows Nina what we’re doing. But it’s acceptable when they do it. It’s clear that Stormi and Nina prefer each other. Stormi’s energy with Nina is positive and engaged, while with the rest of us, it’s indifferent.\n\nNina and I have known each other since early elementary school and grew closer in middle school and high school. We lived together in 2022-2023 with Mary and her sister while in college. That year, Nina started a relationship, and she began focusing more on it, which caused our friendship to feel unbalanced. She shows favoritism towards Stormi and prefers her company over mine. Nina only reaches out to me when she needs something. I’ve tried having multiple conversations with her to fix things, but I get dismissive responses. She tells me to “flush it in the toilet” and that I’m overthinking things. She compares our friendship to the one she has with Stormi, saying they don’t have issues, while I just want to improve our one-on-one bond. Once, I expressed how we no longer talk like we used to, and she bluntly told me, “Not everyone has to know about me telling my parents about my relationship,” which made me feel like she was telling me to stop caring. I miss the closeness we once had.\n\nThese friendship issues are constantly on my mind, and though I try to distract myself, I can’t shake the thoughts. Ana calls the situation childish because the problems remain unresolved, and to her, we’re stuck in a “childhood era” where things aren’t getting better. The core elements of friendship—sharing, supporting, and trusting—feel absent, especially with Stormi and Nina.\n\nI’m not sure if I should keep trying to fix these friendships or let go. Has anyone been in a similar situation? How did you handle it? Any advice would be appreciated.",

Never had I expected that to happen I  my life, but our connection was great and for the longest time the age-gap did not bother me. I ultimately ended the relationship due to uncertainty about staying with her for the long run. Yes, 5-years was big... but for the last 1.5 year of the relationship, things were changing between us. I was toxic inside, I'm sure I was manipulated without realizing it, she never seemed happy enough, and I was not hanging around people my age. I guess the fact she had a failed marriage, a failed engagement, and many relationships before me should of been a red flag from the start... but I was in my late 20s, young and naive. \n\nLeaving was tough, but I know it was the right thing to do. Had I stayed any longer I felt my life would come to a hard stop. I don't want to get into everything because it's a lot to unload. I guess now I'm trying to figure out how to rearrange myself and put myself on a better track for the future. \n\nMaybe this is just vent sesh, or maybe I'm looking for other men who put themselves in a situation like this when they were younger as well. In ways I feel this \"Cougar-Cub\" relationship screwed me up. I really do long for someone closer to my age to build life with. ",

Over the years ive tried gym memberships and off but work life schedule always got in the way so im doing it from home now. Im just wondering if I'll see much strength / physical improvement if I persist.\n\nCurrently fairly fit(ish) from heart perspective, as I walk dog 4km every morning, do a kickboxing class and play soccer once a week (both burn about 500-700 calories according to my Garmin tracker) but am 88kg and 5.8in. \n\nI have started the following routine over the past three weeks with the equipment I have (have additional plates to increase weight if required and a pull up bar that I can barely hang out of for 20 seconds never mind thinking of doing a pull up - which would be a goal eventually):  \n2 days p/week - KB swings (20kg 3 x 20 reps), KB Squats (12kg 3 x 15 reps), KB Rows (14kg 3 x 15 reps each side), Dumbell Chest press (10kg each side 3 x 15 reps), Dumbell Curl (10kg 8/8/6 reps - struggle on last rep), seated bench sit ups 20 x 4 reps (80 total) - All in takes about 40 mins to complete and I find it a good work out with legs and arms like jelly the next day.\n\nI also so a heavy bag High Intensity Cardio for 10 mins on alternate 2 days per week (Definitely builds up a sweat).\n\nAny advice would be appreciated - Diet is fairly decent to be honest, take glocousemin, fish oil and Vitamin D supplement everyday and try and take either eggs or a protein supplement every morning for breakfast. Take outs once/twice a month and social drinking usually once every two weeks with the wife, I have cut out the weekend bottle of wine also as of three weeks ago  \n  \nAny advice on what im doing right, wrong and will I start seeing any improvement in hypothraphy and strength any time soon.

For example, I'd like to go into Advocacy and Social work for victims of sex crimes, but I'm also interested in Forensic Psychology (this is why I studied psychology in the first place), however I've also always been interested in Occupational therapy. I'm at a point in my life where I genuinely have the opportunity to do any of these, I got good grades in my undergrad and actually already have an offer for Psychology Masters. But I'm just so torn on how to make a decision that I won't regret. I'm terrified of making the 'wrong' choice.\n\nany advice is really appreciated",

She says she can hear me scream while I'm sleeping, my foot pounding on the floor; I often wake up on the other side off the bed or on the floor. \n\nIt's not like I'm a war vet, I just have some ptsd from childabuse.  \nIf anyone has any advise, preferably without meds because I'm already on AD and anti-psychotics.",

Then my knees began to fail. If you've ever ridden a recumbent you'll know that all of your power comes from your glutes and quads via your knees. \n\nI had to stop riding.

I was thinking of planting a tree but what else can we do?  There will only be 6 of us and my other sister and I do not have any good memories to share, don’t know her favorite song, and I don’t know any poems etc so I’m at a loss as to what I can do to help my parents cope.    Any ideas? \n\nEdit:  My parents have asked that I help them with this as they do not think they can handle it and they are out of town which is why I’m doing this.  Also our estrangement isn’t anything that has left me with any animosity or things like that.  I am sad as well just not the same as if my other sister died.  She left home 30 years ago due to drugs and moved out of state.  \n\nThanks for the suggestions.  I decided to do the memory tree (my mom’s favorite), got a ground sign in remembrance and a solar spotlight for it.  Then my dad said her favorite food was Mexican and anything coffee so we will have a Mexican feast and coffee dessert cake.  I really liked the idea of “burying old memories” with the tree.

      "selftext": "Hello everyone, I hope you are all doing well. I wanted to comment a little about my situation here. I have always been a person who has dedicated myself to drawing since I was very young, then I dedicated myself to theatre and at 16 I started dancing. Because I like so many things at the same time (which doesn't make me productive at all), I have never been able to decide so for me art was something pleasurable, not productive or something that would give me economic support. I also have to say that I have always been a very cowardly person. I come from a somewhat unstructured family and with many deaths around me, and instead of bringing me closer to art it has completely distanced me from falling into depressions every so often. I stopped doing artistic things from the age of 20, now I am 25. Even so, I have continued drawing and dancing but very little. I also signed up for drama classes a month ago, but in the field of comedy, because I'm naturally good at making people laugh. But as you can see, it's all very varied and makes little sense to me. \n\nI'm currently working in law, and although I've managed to get into a field that interests me within it (technology and law), I feel like I never liked it and that I never really will. Also, it's not a coincidence that I can't get along with my coworkers, or make friends, and then all my friends outside of it are artists. And my partners have all been artists too. It's the world I move in and I envy them a lot because I'm incapable of being so brave.\n\nI always thought that I could dedicate myself to art in my free time, but I feel that the artists I know really enjoy it when they give 100 percent of themselves to their work, talent, or whatever it is that they are giving their soul to. I, on the other hand, feel that I am not doing things right. And that I am lost.\n\nI don't know what to do, what would you do? I need economic stability but it's weird because I feel I earn little money because I'm not that excited about law.",

      "selftext": "22M almost 23. Recently graduated and work in the government. I have really high financial goals and want to be financially successful. I also try to be disciplined and have strong morals. A lot of my friends or the people that I talk to regularly aren’t like that. I would say I only have two friends who are like minded. The rest that I talk to are pretty childish. Some of them are also a year or two younger which doesn’t help. I find that being around them brings me down to their level, and I see myself becoming a version of myself I’ve grown from. My social circle has become the gym and most of the people I talk to there are childish and immature, and I find it rubs off on me at times.\n\nHow do you find friends that want to be successful and push each other? It’s always been a dream of mine to have friends that I can have fun with, and succeed with. Friends that can help push me, and I help push them. Friends with as high standards as me and even higher.\n\nBut often, it feels like out of the people I talked to, I’m the one with the highest standards. Or at least the one who has done and continuous to try to do the things that will bring me success. It’s my dream to be able to learn from my friends and succeed with them. But I don’t really have a circle that I can grow with.",

Been living my whole life in neighborhood A, moved 8 years ago or so to neighborhood B, were most of my friends casually were to finally living on my own.\n\nThese years have been a mix of the best of my life (pre-covid) and the worst of my life (after covid). Most of these friends have moved on with their lives, left the country or simply disappeared. Only one \"remained\", let's call her Martha. We've been there for the other for the ups and downs (and been an almost literal life-saver for each other), and while we were an item, we are now what could be called \"just very close friends.\"\n\nAnyway, things economically have been going \"fine\" for me, and I've been looking for a flat for a while. Price increments and worsening situation has made me kinda desperate as I was getting priced out of neighborhood B and I've ended settling for one in neighborhood A, which is 30-40 minutes in bus from neighborhood B. \n\nAnd I'm freaking up for the change.\n\nThe first and biggest thing is obviously moving away from Martha. We lived really close, and losing randomly going out for a walk, a grocery run or just going to a bar in the neighborhood to have some beers after work is hitting me hard. It's like half-losing a friend, if that makes sense. I *may* have more feelings for her than what I would like to admit, but this is clashing with me not really seeing myself in a relationship at the moment.\n\nThe other thing is that while I hate neighborhood B, I've kinda ended up getting used to it, its spots, its connections, its places to go and do things. I guess this is raw fear of change , but I'm feeling really sad of a lots of \"I'm never going to do this again\" that pop around. Today itself we went to celebrate to a bar that it's close by my home and while we were going back I looked at the -shitty- park and thought \"this is one of the last times I walk through here to my home.\"\n\nOverall, I'm in a position where I should feel relieved and successful for having found a place to live, but all I can feel is defeat.",

      "selftext": "It's no secret that civic engagement has been declining for years in the U.S., and that social media and the current times have not helped us trust one another, generally speaking. I've heard that some other cultures are traditionally more interdependent and cohesive. I noticed in Mexico and Italy, hanging out in town squares and commingling with strangers and neighbors is a thing. (15 or 20 years ago.) Whereas in my current city and in the suburbs I came from, there's no place like town squares to meet and be with others. A lot has been written about our poor urban planning that hinders community. Social historians point out that the advent of TV began the trend of people leaving their front porches and stoops, where life went by,  to huddle indoors around a screen for entertainment and engagement. For a time shopping malls tried to fulfill some of that social engagement, but most of those are dead. Churches also can serve a huge community function, but church attendance is declining too.  \n\nDo you think community is still out there in the U.S.? How about other countries? If so, does it revolve around physical gathering places or something else?",

She kind of was a counselor to me and helped me out with my next step to being a well rounded adult with a fulfilling life. She didn’t have to. But she did bc she loved me. ",

I haven't played any online games in years because everyone is 15+ years younger than me and it *shows.* It's like they speak an entirely different language that I don't even care to try to emulate. I can tell they're in completely different places in life.\n\nAnd just online interaction in general... I miss being able to get online and aimlessly bullshit. I can't join any Discord servers or find a place on ln reddit that feels comfortable, because everyone takes it so seriously And they're trying to fill some kind of void or something. It's really ramped up since COVID. The reddit chatrooms back in early 2020 were the last time I felt like I could get online somewhere and cut up and bullshit late at night and it was no big deal. And that was the absolute LAST bastion for me. I can't do that anymore.\n\nI miss the old Internet. Back when \"trolling\" was harmless kid shit and not politically-charged. When anonymity and a clear divide between your real life and online life still existed. Before everyone found every little reason to get offended at people just joking (not talking about 13 year-olds saying the n-word on StarCraft or other shit we look back and cringe at; just anything at all not representing how you really felt about the world). Before ads and adware were baked into everything, net neutrality being questioned, bots and AI taking over the discourse. It feels like anyone younger than 30 really got robbed of the true Internet experience.\n\nI dunno, I'm just tipsy and musing. I just miss being awake late at night and having entertainment and a place of belonging. I feel like I've \"aged out\" of the Internet and it kind of depresses me.",

I don't think it's just in my head because objectively the quality/size of things like McDonalds burgers has shrunk over the past 20 years.\n\nAnd it's not just food, for example in entertainment I remember the days when there'd be like 4 great movies coming out in the same week you wouldn't have time to see them all at the cinema. For example, in 1993 Pulp Fiction, Shawshank Redemption, Jurassic Park, and Forrest Gump were all in theatres at the same time. Nowadays it feels like there's maybe 3 of these big movies per year.

There was nothing extravagant about what we did for each other, but lots of heartfelt things such as cards, flowers, chocolates, small gifts, and just time together(which is the most extravagant gifts one can give).\n\nAfter 45 years of being together, the love is still strong, but we don’t tend to do a whole lot on Valentine’s Day  for each other and have transferred that energy to our children and now our granddaughter.\n\nIt’s not that our love for each other has faded. It’s just that we demonstrate that love on a daily basis rather than reserve it for one day of the year.\n\nThe most special things we do today will be for our four year-old granddaughter who came over last night and received part of her gift and will receive more today.\n\nI did bake a sourdough loaf with a large heart on it and may make a special dessert today. If I do that, it will probably be with my wife rather than simply for her.\n\nBut yes, I do remember the sweetness of being 20 something years old and madly in love. I’m pretty happy being 60 something years old and in love with the same woman.\n\nI’m curious to hear your thoughts on Valentine’s Day and how you celebrate .\n\nAnd yes, my thoughts are with those of you who for whatever reason don’t have that special person to celebrate with today ",

But this guy came highly recommended by a friend and from second one he treated me like I was a million dollar client.  Answered every dumb question, schooled me on the process, really helped me and it's only because of him I was able to get that house.  I got so taken with the whole thing I got my license and went to work with him.\n\nHe mentored me and we did some great work together for 15 years.  We focused mainly on low income clients and first time buyers, people that actually needed our help.  Consequently we never got rich or made much money in the business but we were helping people and that was important to me, it made me feel like we were accomplishing something.  In a business filled with sharks and greedy assholes we were out there actually helping people.  \n\nI left the businesses last year, nothing bad, no animosity, just got burned out on it and he was already not working by then \"recuperating\" he said but I think we both knew.  \n\nI got the call today he had passed.  \n\nI was listless, stuck in a cubicle farm, unhappy just working a job paying too much for an apartment when I found this Realtor and working with him ignited a passion and set me on a career path and put me in a situation for financial security by owning a home.  It was a pretty amazing thing.  I got lucky.\n\nHe was a good guy, a good father, brother and husband and a good friend.\n\nRIP, Saul.\n\nOseh shalom bimromav, hu ya'aseh shalom aleinu v'al kol yisrael v'imru amen\n\n(I think I got that right, he was jewish obviously and I'm a non denominational southern gentile so...I tried, lol)\n\nedit:  Thank you for the kind words, everyone.

Being close to them is important to me but I feel like I am settling here for the sake of being close to them, even though I can't say I love living in Houston.  Part of me wants to leave Houston but I truly don't know where I would go.  I don't see myself moving back to my hometown.  Do I just need to travel more?  In theory that sounds great, but I am not sure it would change the way I feel about Houston.  I feel like if I ever had the courage to move somewhere else, I would be sacrificing being a close drive away from my family, but if I stay where I am, yes I'm close to family but I don't like the city I live in.  I have struggled with this indecision for years and it keeps coming back around and I keep staying because I don't know what to do.

      "selftext": "I spent several years preparing for retirement, and for those of you are on the path, I’d like to share a few thoughts\n\nRetirement is a huge life transition and one that does not seem to get talked about very much. The change from going from a worker to a retiree is enormous. Preparing for that change can help smooth out the move.\n\nI stopped working almost 11 months ago and I still consider myself “in transition”. Be clear, I’m having a blast in transition, but I don’t feel like I’m there yet. I’m also not sure where “there” will be but that’s part of the journey for me.\n\nThe years before retirement, I looked at three aspects that I needed to focus on:\n\nthe money.\nSocial interaction.\nSense of purpose \n\nThe money was the easy part. I either had it, would have it, or wouldn’t. For me as I’ve been planning for more than 30 years I was comfortable. Not wealthy but comfortable and stable. \n\nI’m a fairly gregarious person and need social interaction and although I was never much for socializing with workers outside of work, it’s been a challenge for me to get enough interaction outside my immediate household. Building and maintaining a strong network of family and friends prior to retirement was very helpful.\n\nIn modern society retirement doesn’t mean we’re gonna sit around all day in our boxers reading the paper (my apologies for the gender oriented reference. It’s just an image and not meant to exclude females). Most of us will have a decade or more of life ahead of us, we are strong, healthy, and have a lot of dreams and aspirations. So what is it that’s gonna fill our time? What’s gonna get us out of bed? What is gonna make us feel good and bring us joy? At the end of each day what are we gonna feel good about? The thought of sitting around the home all day is really not appealing.\n\nThose are three things I worked on for years prior to retirement so when I did finally pull the plug, the transition was much easier. I have many hobbies and interests, and a granddaughter who lives four minutes away. I have a wide network of friends that I see on a regular basis and even a larger network of trails near my home. However, I’m still looking for that project that’s gonna occupy my time in a bigger way. Not necessarily a job, but maybe.\n\n I will say this. It’s a huge transition, but it’s a really\n\nWould love to hear your stories and comments. If you’re one of the fortunate ones who are getting ready to retire retirement, and encourage you to think about the transition years before you make it\n\n\n",

Note, the text after the picture is separate from [**5calls.org**](https://5calls.org/)**.**  I do not know who wrote it.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oscjzt3s6jhe1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a472446e9ce1c4e30cb62487386161da2eaa1b3\n\n[**https://5calls.org/**](https://5calls.org/) Enter your address and it will find all your reps (federal and state). AND give you a list of issues to call about AND which reps to call about each of them AND a little script for each, in case it's helpful. They have an app, too.\"\n\n\\---\n\n**FOR THOSE OF YOU LOOKING TO TURN YOUR ANGER INTO ACTION**  \n  \nHere's some advice from a high-level staffer for a Senator.\n\nThere are two things that we should be doing all the time right now, and they're by far the most important things.\n\n**You should NOT be bothering with online petitions or emailing.**\n\n1. The best thing you can do to be heard and get your congressperson to pay attention is to have FACE-TO-FACE time — if they have town halls, go to them. Go to their local offices. If you're in DC, try to find a way to go to an event of theirs. Go to the \"mobile offices\" that their staff hold periodically (all these times are located on each congressperson's website). When you go, ask questions. A lot of them. And push for answers. The louder and more vocal and present you can be at those the better.\n2. But those in-person events don't happen every day. So, the absolute most important thing that people should be doing every day is calling. YOU SHOULD MAKE 6 CALLS A DAY: 2 each (DC office and your local office) to your 2 Senators & your 1 Representative.\n\nThe staffer was very clear that any sort of online contact basically gets immediately ignored, and letters pretty much get thrown in the trash (unless you have a particularly strong emotional story — but even then, it's not worth the time it took you to craft that letter).\n\n**CALLS ARE WHAT ALL THE CONGRESSPEOPLE PAY ATTENTION TO.**\n\nEvery single day, the Senior Staff and the Senator get a report of the 3 most-called-about topics for that day at each of their offices (in DC and local offices), and exactly how many people said what about each of those topics. They're also sorted by zip code and area code.\n\nShe said that REPUBLICAN CALLERS GENERALLY OUTNUMBER DEMOCRAT CALLERS 4-1, and when it's a particular issue that single-issue-voters pay attention to (like gun control, or planned parenthood funding, etc...), it's often closer to 11-1, and that's recently pushed Republican congressmen on the fence to vote with the Republicans. In the last 8 years, Republicans have called, and Democrats haven't.  \nSo, when you call:\n\nA) Ask for the Staff member in charge of whatever you're calling about (\"Hi, I'd like to speak with the staffer in charge of Healthcare, please\") — local offices won't always have specific ones, but they might. If you get transferred to that person, awesome. If you don't, that's ok — ask for that person's name, and then just keep talking to whoever answered the phone.\n\nB) DON'T LEAVE A MESSAGE (unless the office doesn't pick up at all — then you can — but it's better to talk to the staffer who first answered than leave a message for the specific staffer in charge of your topic).\n\nC) GIVE THEM YOUR ZIP CODE. They won't always ask for it, but make sure you give it to them, so they can mark it down. Extra points if you live in a zip code that traditionally votes for them, since they'll want to make sure they get/keep your vote.\n\nD) MAKE IT PERSONAL if you can. \"I voted for you in the last election and I'm worried/happy/whatever\" or \"I'm a teacher, and I am appalled by the nomination of Ingrid Kolb,\" or \"as a single mother\" or \"as a white, middle-class woman,\" or whatever.\n\nE) PICK 1-2 SPECIFIC THINGS per day to focus on. Don't rattle off everything you're concerned about — they're figuring out what 1-2 topics to mark you down for on their lists. So, focus on 1-2 per day. Ideally something that will be voted on/taken up in the next few days, but it doesn't really matter — even if there's not a vote coming up in the next week, call anyway. It's important that they just keep getting calls.\n\nF) BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT — \"I'm disappointed that the Senator...\" or \"I want to thank the Senator for their vote on... \" or \"I want the Senator to know that voting in \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ way is the wrong decision for our state because... \" Don't leave any ambiguity.\n\nG) They may get to know your voice/get sick of you — it doesn't matter. The people answering the phones generally turn over every 6 weeks anyway, so even if they're really sick of you, they'll be gone in 6 weeks.\n\nH) PUT THE 6 NUMBERS IN YOUR PHONE (all under P – Politician.) An example is McCaskill MO, Politician McCaskill DC, Politician Blunt MO, etc., which makes it really easy to click down the list each day.  \nFrom experience since the election: If you hate being on the phone & feel awkward (which is a lot of people) don't worry about it — there are a bunch of scripts (Indivisible has some, there are lots of others floating around these day). After a few days of calling, it starts to feel a lot more natural.",

Not only do I have agency over my time, but my mind is no longer clogged with thoughts of work, petty problems, Snell, relationships, and ridiculous policies.\n\nEvery day I get to choose what I do, when to do it, and even if I wanna do it. \n\nI have time to go more slowly and enjoy things. For example, I’ve always loved cooking, but I find the joy I get out of simple things like chopping vegetables has increased because I no longer feel rushed. I can just slow down. \n\nTo be clear, I’m far from wealthy, but I am financially stable for life. \n\nI worked for close to 50 years and never thought I would be retired. It’s a great thing and I hope you all get there and I hope you have it even better than I do. \n\nIf I were to offer any advice to young people, it would be to make a plan so you can retire. Il worked for government so I have a pension. I also have a 401(k). If you don’t work for a company that provides a pension, which is probably your case, save money. You will be my age sooner than you think.\n\nFor older people, the advice I would offer is retire as soon as you can. I loved my job, but I love my new gig monkey better. All the problems I thought were so important that they’re now in my rearview mirror and I don’t even think about them anymore.\n\nGood luck to all\n\n",

      "title": "Donald Trump is a pawn for something darker.",
      "selftext": "OK, guys! I posted this yesterday, in another sub but it was a lot to respond too so I'm reposting a more concise discussion sorry it's long. So after Trump got elected the 1st time, he moved his assets into a revocable trust basically to separate himself from whatever businesses he didn't bankrupt at that point while in office. He himself said he would abstain from seeking foreign deal, however the Trump Organization acting as a separate entity struck deals with foreign government officials while also generating revenue for his hotels through Lobbyists, allies, and others are trying to pay to play. Even going so far as to offer stays to foreign nationals and business people. He knew how his laws would affect his business, as did others; so around this time is when I think he came in contact with Tech Bros.\n\nThen, dec 2017, Trump signs the tax cuts, and government revenue drops by 8% weakening our overall structure. Everything in the early days and everything since has been either to nurture already existing malice in the population or move towards a specific ideology not authored by him but authored by the people backing him silently called a Butterfly revolution. I don't want to invalidate your real emotions, but almost everything you've seen, the executive orders, the firings,  pardons, all of it don't actually matter in the grand scheme. It's simply a tool to make you disoriented, with the added benefit of contributing to already existing American decline.\n\nThey're using black, lgbtq, immigrants, and women to scapegoat all of Amerca's problems. They're using the original playbook white nationalist used to enslaved black people by destabilizing tribes in Africa. Slavery was America' original sin, and that's what they want to relish in, to make America great again. They want to go back, and they're actively executing a plan to do that. America has 5 major foundational problems that we never addressed, which made it possible to happen racism, inequality, two party systems, corporate tax laws, and personal financial literacy.\n\nAfter the election I researched several topics including geopolitical topics, fascism, American decline and even finance, and I stumbled on a video about the Techno Oligarchy and really everything after that made sense, I believe everyone needs to watch it, &  I believe most of politics right now is a distraction besides a few glossed over moments by the media, that's being orchestrated by silicon valley, & Vladimir Putin. There's 7 main players, I think, not including Putin or Trump, who are taking steps to see to It that this is our future; a Technocratic Feifdom. Network states controlled by AI, in the remains of the United States and its territory abroad. \n\nThese men, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, Peter Thiel, Sam Altman, JD Vance, and Balaji Srinivasan, are actively trying to create a new world order. The plan for them to gain control is to put as much strain on American institutions and it's economy as possible and do anything to weaken our democracy. They will get increasingly hostile towards the outside world and take up a period of isolationism. They will work to undermine American favorability and reliability and flame concerns over the viability of the dollars long term position. There will be a lack of stability around the world, and then they will try to crash the economy with a major war, possibly WW3, or maybe even cause another pandemic. \n\nOnce the economy crashes, they'll buy up everything, and the dollar position as the world's reserve currency will be weaker than it's ever been. They will offer up crypto as an alternative to the dollar. Either Trump's regime or JD Vance's future regime will denominate the dollar value of the national debt, which will surely be so unbelievably massive by that point into crypto. Trump or Vance will drive up the prices, think about how he created his own coin. Once the market value of crypto exceeds the national debt, they'll wipe it. Maga will get to pretend that's it's a great political achievement and that it will solidify support for the republican party indefinitely. \n\nAfter the debt is wiped, crypto will fully have taken over as the new dominant currency, meaning the dollar will be relegated to a second tier currency and American citizens effectively reduced to destitute 3rd world circumstances, as the new normal including the ongoing effects of climate change. The crypto reserve currency will hold all the value, and its pioneers will essentially be wealthier than states  Corporations will essentially be equivalent to countries and they will divide up the land and each create they're own city states where feudaliatic practices and AI verification, nanotechnology, cyber chips and the lot will be everyday life. \n\nPoor people will be enslaved to the network states, and democracy will be long gone. I'm not saying I don't care about what's going on right now. I'm saying it's all a distraction disconnect a little and think long game like billionaires do. Think about it, Why do you think Trump is threatening Canada, Greenland, and Panama Canal they're trying to acquire land. Why do you think companies are buying up all these single family home, why does Bill Gates own more land than anyone in America. The LA fires, the dismantling of our aviation system, Elon breaching the treasury, etc. Why has Trump had business relationships with Russia since they bailed out his hotels in the 80's. This has always been the long game. White supremacy christian nationalism was just the vehicle they used to get us here.\n\nI know you think it's conspiracy, but it's not the evidence that is right in front of us. You can watch videos of these people talking about this stuff. The originator of the Butterfly revolution ideology is a guy named Curtis Yarvin, and he mentored JD Vance and Elon Musk. Elon Musk bought an election, and republican states successfully purged 3.5 million votes from the pool, and here we are. We think they're more powerful than they are. The chaos makes use think these are strongmen. They aren't they're conmen and sifi tech nerds who exploit us and steal our money. America is being stolen in front of our eyes. Do we not think it's possible that Russian spies couldn't have been hiding out at Trump's properties for decades working under the cloak of immigration that they escoriate? \n\nLook, every single thing they do is not necessarily for a long-term plan, but you're lying to yourself if you don't think that something massive is going on behind the scenes. We see tariffs, and we think, omg that's gonna hurt my quality of life, but we should be looking at them as weapons against us. Everything is being weapons weaponized, even words, so why tf do you think they're weaponizing life if they don't plan on going to war! The war is against us! They want you to think it over, but hope, community, skills, and finance literacy are put weapons. Start learning, building connecting because it's far from over in fact the beginning. You think just as easily as Russia, Elon, and Republicans rigged the election in Trump's favor, they can't do it again? For someone else, JD Vance? \n\nIt's all right in front of us people we need to wake each other up. I know things are heavy collectively and take a break. Ignore everything, reset, and think critically. There's a lot we can do, but we have to capitalize on our opportunities. Midterms will be one 2028 will be another we can't miss the last few we have left. Black people and other minorities I know are especially apathetic right now, but I mean this when I say that a revolution will not happen without black people. It's going to take all of us, and we have the blueprint we've done it before research how people survived before in times of peril. Don't let them keep playing us like a drum. I have some articles and videos on hand if anyone wants to dive deeper. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/5RpPTRcz1no?si=Ed9SuG9jea8Amiqa\n\nUpdate: I started a community for the 99% \n\nr/The99Society ",

Or do you think it still taught you valuable skills along the way? And if you could go back, what would you have spent that time on instead?\n\nI’d love to hear from everyone, but especially those 45 and older—the more life experience, the better. Your perspective is what I’m really interested in.",

Then things got worse—he got addicted to gambling, lost all our savings, even used my salary, took out online loans, and maxed out credit cards. He hit rock bottom, quit his job, and for six months, I carried us financially. I endured no dates, no effort, no flowers—just him playing Dota, and I let him because I thought he needed an escape.\nI was exhausted, always overthinking, wondering if he still had plans for us. And after all that? HE CHEATED. With a coworker he barely knew—a woman with two kids. He chose her over me and his own daughter.\nTheir situationship probably started even before he got his new job. I was just waiting for effort, for change, but instead, on December 31, I got cold treatment. He came home late, I just wanted a little affection, and out of nowhere—he broke up with me. We tried to fix things, but in the end, he confessed that he and that girl were already official by January 10, 2025.\nAnd the worst part? After everything, I still begged him to stay.

Even if I work remotely one day a week, the commute still exhausts me.\n\nI live in a 2 bed, 2 bath apartment with my boyfriend in the suburbs for $2,050 a month (we were lucky to find a great deal!), but moving closer to work would mean paying $2,300-2,700 for less space and fewer amenities.\n\nI’m torn between:\n\n1. Moving closer and paying more for less space/amenities, or\n2. Staying where we are and finding a new job closer to home (I’ve also seen higher-paying options closer to me).\n\nI’m hesitant to job hunt since my last job was not so great (my boss treated me horribly and basically ran me out of the company), and I don't want to risk going through that experience again, but I do enjoy where we've living now. Anyone who's been through a similar experience and has any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!!",

      "selftext": "Grampy,\n\nI remember hearing your stories—the draft, the European theatre, and, my lord, the French women. I remember how your tone would shift when you spoke about the battles, the friends you lost, and the Nazis. I didn’t understand then- and maybe never will- why it was so easy for you to talk about the little things during the war. You could talk about the wine you drank, how good the chocolate was, and the time you piloted the *Queen Elizabeth* homeward across the Atlantic because everyone else was hungover (please don’t fact-check my poor Gramps).\n\nBut you couldn’t talk about D-Day. You couldn’t talk about the Battle of the Bulge. You only once spoke of your best friend in Europe- because he was shot in the head right beside you and you watched him bleed out. I never asked about that again. I'm sorry I asked about it, even then.\n\nBecause you lived it. So that I wouldn't have to.\n\nI understand a little more now, though I hope to God our people never have to go through the same trials and tribulations.\n\nMy Grampy was a blue-collar mill worker from New England- a hardworking man who earned a living with his hands for more than 40 years after he returned from Europe. Make no mistake about it, he was a conservative.\n\nBut he was no god-damned Nazi, and he knew exactly who and what the Nazis were.\n\nMy great-grandfather- and your grandfathers and grandmothers- paid a bill almost 100 years ago.\n\nThey fought, bled, lost, and won for nearly a decade to secure democracy and the rights of common people across the globe. We have benefited from their sacrifice for almost a century.\n\nNow, because we have neglected to uphold the promise the Greatest Generation made, another bill has come due. They warned us over and over. They told us that evil people would raise their heads again. They knew another group of weak men would try to take advantage of our goodwill.\n\nAmerica was the first constitutional democracy. While we have certainly made egregious mistakes as a country, we have always been the greatest place for ordinary men and women to live. We forget it was once called the Great Experiment because the melting pot seemed so natural to us growing up. We grew up basking in the glow of optimism in a “post-history” world—how could we ever go backwards? A nation, built by immigrants, that could only prosper and shine as the City upon the Hill.\n\nThese people aren't Americans. They aren't like us. They would sell their mothers for 15 minutes of fame.\n\nIt would be easy now- as it would have been easy then- to roll over and allow the vultures to ravage our people and the country our forefathers built. It would be just as easy now as it would have been then to let them rob our mothers of a dignified retirement, rob our fathers of their rationality, and rob our now-dead grandfathers of their sacrifice. We cannot allow them to win so easily. Our people have fought too hard, for too long, for our inalienable rights as individuals.\n\nOur inheritance is an obligation—an obligation to our children, our children’s children, and their children. We must uphold true American values: hard work, ingenuity, and a fighting spirit.\n\nIt will be hard, it will be dangerous, and it will certainly be grim. But it has been hard before. It has been dangerous before. It has been grim before.\n\nWe won then, and come hell or high water, we will win again. We have no choice.\n\nYou weren't much a fan of Eisenhower. I remember that he was late with your tank fuel and chocolate on several occasions, though I'm fairly sure which one meant more to you. It took years before you would admit you drove on the Eisenhower Interstate system every day.\n\nYou did, however, idolize Churchill after seeing him rouse the troops on a single occasion. There, you said, was a Real Man.\n\n“We shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds… We shall never surrender.”\n\nWe **will** rout them from the field. We **will** drive them back into their holes. We **will** embarrass them.\n\nWe **will** beat them so god-damned thoroughly that they will never show their weak, pudgy, pink little faces again.\n\nGrampy, I promise.",

      "selftext": "\\*\\*\\*Update: my primary physician doesn't think the middle finger pain is arthritis because it is on the palm side of the finger and not at thr knuckle/joint. She thinks it is related to the tendon. The pain was causing a general stiffness of the hand and I'm now spiraling thinking it's the other way around--the hand stiffness is causing the tendon pain. This is a neurodegenerative disease, right? Spiraling again. Please help. Going to call hand doc for appointment tomorrow. \n\nHi friends,\n\nMy middle finger hurts at the base, but only when I try to push it back. It's quite painful. I've also noticed that my right forearm, and my arm right up into my neck are tight. I am someone who uses the computer for work (though with a padded keyboard and mouse pad to support my wrist). I also exercise on a Peloton bike around 6 days a week and weight train 3 days a week. I've laid off the weights because of this painful middle finger. I'm also holding my phone in this hand pretty much all day.\n\nWhile my suspicion is that this is arthritis (my mom has pretty bad arthritis in her fingers and hands), my dad's side of the family does have a neuromuscular condition (it's a cousin of Parkinson's) and I'm just starting to spiral now. Rest assured that I am seeing my primary in 6 days but would love to hear from others who've also experienced this kind of pain. I don't want to die!",

I knew my paternal grandmother was the most recent immigrant in my family. She came to the US from Canada when she was roughly 8-10 years old at the time. She naturalized as an adult in either the late 1930’s or 40’s. \n\nI thought my paternal grandfather was a first generation American but it turns out my aunt just learned that his great grandfather was the first member of our family to immigrate to the US from Scotland. I believe my grandfather’s mother came from England. He was born here in 1911.\n\nI have no idea when or where my maternal side came from. Mom did one of those DNA ancestry kits and found we have ties to  Great Britain and Scandinavia but we have no idea who they were or when they crossed the ocean. She always swore we were part Native American, always citing Cherokee. However, Cherokee weren’t native to central Maine where the family we know is from. If anything, we might be part Penobscot.\n\nI have to admit, I was never curious about this until today. I barely remember two of my great grandparents. It never crossed my mind to ask such questions.",

      "selftext": "Hi! So here's some 'background' on me: (Female) Worked all the odd jobs one can think when I was young (catering, temp, ad sales, receptionist, spent many years in retail and waiting tables, shoe model, cocktail waitress, delivered flowers for a florist) but finally my work paid off and I started working a lot in my chosen field. Worked a ton in my 30's. Then husband & I decided to move out of the big city for our child to have a yard, and a good foundation, a (public) school, etc. My work started slowing down a bit almost immediately because I was 3 hours away from work but I commuted (not every day but when I had work). And I kept working in my chosen field and made it work.\n\nThen in my 40's ..Had immediate eye surgery to save my sight and dealt with some major traumatic stress stuff because of it.\n\nPicked myself up, kept raising our son, being there for my husband and still working .\n\nCut to pandemic- it literally killed my career. I used to make 6 fig income now I barely make min wage (remote and hardly any work). Whatever.\n\nNow in my 50's.. Decided to take on a part time job for my head & to build up (and not dip into) my savings. I knew I needed lots of $$$ because I had dental nightmare: 2 teeth pulled, severe bone augmentation & sinus lift and 2x implants = which all said and done will cost me$18K.\n\nI worked this Part time job for just under 2 years, during this time I had the surgeries for my teeth (jaw) and suddenly, my husband had a major health scare. We dealt with that all last year. The PT job let me go in Sept. New manager came in, started cutting my hours and then took me off the schedule completely. When I reached out to upper manangement to ask basically if I could be on the schedule.. I was given a courtesy \"we are currently all staffed but if we get any openings, you'll be the first to know\" text. If I'm honest I was kind of hating the job and they probably put me out of my misery.\n\nI'm a big 'things happen for a reason' kind of person. I've been applying for other PT work (after taking some time to recover from all the dental surgeries) and still working my \"previous career\" work off & on (it's very freelance/ sporadic work). I'm enjoying the idea of maybe doing something new & exciting. But money is getting tighter and that's making me feel more desperate.\n\nSo.. here I am. 51. I have an incredible husband, incredible kid. I HAD an amazing career, one of was proud of and enjoyed every minute. I'm not sure I'll ever get back. I miss my old life .. alot but you can't go back. My ego took a hit with being let go at that PT job. I'm also older. I don't look my age (people always think I'm younger) but I feel the mid life stuff creeping up on me.\n\nLife ain't always easy, but I continue to stay grateful. But boy, this stuff isn't easy all the time. They say it sure beats the alternative. I'm not dead. I'm not homeless, I'm not an addict. I'm still happily married. My kid is a great person. But ... man,\n\nAnyone relate?\n\n  \n\\*\\*UPDATE\\*\\* I've been doing some major tuning myself up work and realize my role in this and have found closure on being let go of the PT job. I just interviewed  & have a job offer for a new PT position. Trying to hold onto lessons learned. Staying grateful. And staying smart about it all. Thanks to all who responded :)",

I'm just at a loss, and don't really know what to do now that I'm confronted with so many possibilities. Regardless of what I do, I am alone. I have no family to rely on as they are all dead or estranged(or terrible), so I have to really think for myself. \n\n  \nI want to live somewhere Oregon adjacent just minus all the rain, but I don't want to stray too far from the west coast.

I've got a cat, that's the extent of my family. Any advice or guidance would be greatly appreciated.

I'm well aware that some of these fly in the face of the Constitution, but that may not be the protection you think it is.\n\n* A state of national emergency is declared and national elections are suspended.\n* A million or two undesirables become incarcerated at detention camps.\n* Tariffs cause an annual inflation rate exceeding 10%.\n* Major newspapers or TV networks with news programming are shut down, leaving mostly social media controlled by right-wing leadership.\n* Unions are banned.\n* A nationwide ban on abortions is passed.\n* A national police force is created to crack down on citizenry, or the military is used for that purpose.\n* Dozens of protestors are shot by National Guard at some event.\n* Greenland or Canada or Panama get invaded by US military personnel.\n* The Democratic party becomes banned.\n* The US is declared a Christian nation.\n* A pledge of loyalty to the President is required of all military and civil servant federal employees.\n* An order is issued to shoot to kill anyone crossing a US border without having the right papers.\n* Russia invades a NATO country and the US declares it will not respond militarily.\n\n**EDIT**: I want to thank all the people who have responded to make this a more-active-than-usual post for this sub, and for the handful of folks who thought enough to slap an award on it. I also read those among you who think this is fearmongering nonsense and that none of it will ever happen. To those people, I only urge you to read the surprisingly large number of people who felt that the line has already been crossed and have either already made or are making the laborious and costly effort to disrupt their lives and leave a country that they love. Those people aren't affected by fearmongering by me; they made their decision long before I said anything. As to the difficulty of that move, note that in the 1930's half of Jewish German citizens left Germany (usually with nothing but a bag, because everything else had been confiscated), and that in the last fifteen years a full 25% of Venezuelan citizens have spent their last dime to get out. (And to those who say Venezuelans are just looking for better pay elsewhere, I can assure you from direct family connection this is simply not true.) I also acknowledge that those who left in those cases were directly affected, sure.\n\nAs to the likelihood that any of this will come true, I have no idea. What I can tell you today is, I would never guessed ten years ago that in America:\n\n* Seditious rioters would break into the Capitol to disrupt the certification of an election\n* Four years and two weeks later, those convicted seditionists would be pardoned\n* The SCOTUS, protectors of the Constitution, would find that the President is the only person in the country that is above the law\n* A group of billionaires would buy an election by powering SuperPACs\n* A convicted felon would be elected President\n* The Constitutional amendment protecting birthright citizenship would be challenged by the chief executive sworn to uphold the Constitution\n* A person in the President's White House staff would giddily fly the Nazi salute to a cheering crowd at an inauguration\n\nThat's not fearmongering, those are established facts. So don't be so eager to dismiss that which you now believe will never happen, because you also believed not so long ago that these things were unlikely to happen. Historically also, those good citizens in strong nations that went bad often could not imagine it would happen there.",

I ended up spent a LOT of time researching grants and charitable donation organizations.  At that time the news spread about some idiot making a gofundme for a potato salad recipe and bringing in a lot of money and that burned my ass.  LOL!\n\nOkay, I learned, and ultimately understood that fundraising was a lot of work in any sized nonprofit.  As I learned, I did get better at bringing in some small funds.\n\nFast forward to this week, I have a friend in desperate financial need and I volunteered to set up a gofundme.  I know how these things work now so I told him to post the campaign on all his social media and I would too.  The more it's spread, the more likely he'd get donations.  We've been posting it on Facebook and various donation-related subreddits.  He's not asking for a lot and he's not one of those people who are in constant need.  I wrote a good explanation and title.  But it's getting no traction at all. I donated a bit, both to help him out and also to \"seed\" the campaign.  So far nothing.\n\nBut I know there are millions of people in similar financial straits.  Our economy is in the shits, and it's going to get worse.  So on that front, I'm not surprised that one campaign isn't drawing any donations.  On the other hand, you look at some of the similar campaigns on gofundme and they've brought in at least some money.\n\nI guess to turn this from just a vent post to asking for help, anybody know how I can get it in front of people who do donate, like church groups or something?",

      "title": "Should I choose my career, or my personal life?",
      "selftext": "Disclaimer - I know this is not a great question for Reddit, and should be an entirely personal decision. However, I'd love some objective advice from people who don't know me!\n\nI'm a 29 year old freelance Video Editor and Producer. My first job was an entry level full-time Assistant Editor position at Nat Geo. I left after about 3 years for a number of reasons, one being that the full-time 9-5 hustle really drained me. I was tired, burnt out, and not taking care of myself physically. When I went freelance, my personal life really excelled. And I loved the autonomy it gave me. After 2 years of being freelance, I decided to leave DC and move back to my home city. I loved DC, but it never felt right for me longterm. \n\nI never thought I'd be someone that moved closer to home, but I am so happy here. I met the love of my life, I appreciate that I can see my family more often, and I'm in a part of the country that I would ideally like to settle down in. I am able to work from home and I enjoy most of my freelance work; I still do some work with Nat Geo, so my career still fulfills me. However, there is part of me that worries I'm missing out on career opportunities.\n\nThere is one specific team at Nat Geo that I have always wanted to work with, and I've had a number of opportunities to do so full-time. However, it's always been a step down from my current position. I'd be going back to an Assistant Editor or Associate Producer after 3 years as a Senior Editor and Producer, and I'd make half of what I make now as a freelancer (from 130k to maybe 65k). But for whatever reason, I can't seem to stop thinking about it. I love the content they make...it has always been my dream to work with them. And there would be opportunity for incredible travel, if I was eventually promoted.\n\nHere are my reservations - \n\nBeing promoted back to my current standing would likely take at least 4 years (I'd be 33/34). And I still would not be making what I make now (I'd guess 85k) On top of that, I'd have to move back to DC. I have plenty of friends there, and my partner would come with me, but it is just not where I want to be. I've never been as happy as I am now. And I don't think I could ever leave DC, if I wanted to stay on that team longterm. Coming back home would always mean leaving Nat Geo.\n\nSo my dilemma is - should I pursue my dream of working with this team? I feel like I'm at an age where it is now or never. When I'm 5 years older and may have a mortgage and kids, I can't imagine I'd take an entry level position at any company. I would love some advice from people a bit older and wiser than me. What would you do?",

They already had a public argument about who was planning what. Some things never change. \nI posted that I likely wouldn't attend. That I honestly wouldn't remember many people. One person replied sarcastically 'thanks a lot', but I know she came to visit here a while ago and didn't reach out.

Those findings can be found [here](https://www.hhs.gov/surgeongeneral/priorities/alcohol-cancer/index.html).\n\nPlease let me know if you would be willing to be interviewed for the piece! Really hoping to find a few more folks (women, people of color, LGBTQIA+) age 55+ to participate. Especially those who do not live in major U.S. cities.\n\nThe interview will be brief, about 20 minutes or so, over the phone. My deadline is Monday, January 20, so I'd like to schedule some time to chat either today or tomorrow (Jan. 19) at the very latest.\n\nIf you are interested, I'll also need a photo (hi-resolution selfie or close-up portrait) to run alongside your response.\n\nI hope to hear from you soon!\n\nSincerely,  \nJessi Roti",

I don't know how to explain this, but I say for myself, I used to be a happy-go-lucky kind of person before the pandemic. I was always full of life, making friends, and having hopes about the future. Although nothing is perfect, I still have problems. Before the pandemic, there was like a bit of an upbeatness to life, like nothing I could worry too much about. But ever since the start of the pandemic, I've turned to a completely different person. I'm no longer optimistic about the future, and I'm becoming more easily pessimistic about people and more pessimistic myself too. This is something I noticed a lot of people said too, and how people are before and after the pandemic, even the most mentally strong people I know, has become worse after the pandemic. The most positive people have become completely different from how they used to be, and how different things are now: the quality of everything has dropped, everything is becoming more expensive, and people are meaner and ruder. There are no more late-night 24/7 things anymore. Does anyone relate to this too? You used to be a happier person before covid/pandemic, and now it seems like you are a different person. Sometimes I look at the photos pre-covid, 2018-2019 and can't believe im the same person as the one in the photograph, and miss how good times were back then. Now it feels like we are in a different world/planet, like 10 years, the shift from 2019 to 2020, in just 1 year after the pandemic. I don't know if I make sense.Even my gen x mum, in her early 60s, who has been through 911 and several disasters, said the same thing: she has never felt anything like this. Ever since covid, it has felt like the world has become a darker place, and nothing like she experienced, and the people who have been with her who experienced 911 and other disasters didn't change until covid. She felt like the closest people to her have changed and feel like there is something with the vibes.",

She goes to the doctors constantly and they tell her she has to eat more protein ect. They ran tons of test and said she might have to go on TPN. She went back in today and they told her they were going to admit her tomorrow to try and figure out what’s going on. \n\nThis is going to sound terrible but right before her surgery I told my wife and some close family that I fully expect this whole thing to kill her.

She’s only 56 and shouldn’t living like this. I’m worried now that it’s too late and that something bad is going to happen tomorrow. ",

Ever since I've just been in survival mode.  Been self employed for the past 3-4 years doing dog walking.  Finally starting to break into graphic design work and doing videography work.  Currently have a romantic partner who I feel is the love of my life.  I am starting to have this itch of travelling and working abroad, have basically no savings, and part of me feels like I fucked up somewhere along the way because I'm somewhat behind where others are at.  \n\nI know comparison is the thief of joy and I should be happy where I am at, but looking at holiday work visas or any opportunities to work in japan seem futile.  I don't have a bachelor's nor do I have the patience to go back to school as I see it as this ridiculously expensive thing that doesn't actually do a thing for you except give you a piece of paper that represents i did a thing that got me a thing.  Doing the thing to do the thing without giving you real world experience. (Not judging anyone who has don't this, but I've just never liked school as it doesn't engage my brain enough and find it difficult to concentrate when I don't feel engaged.  Yes I have been diagnosed with ADHD as an early child)\n\nPerhaps it's too late even if I were to do the school thing anyways.  The only reason I'd be doing it is for the opportunity it gives you for working abroad, but not necessarily related to the things I'd want to do abroad.  \n\nNot trying to sound like a victim, I am living the product of my own making and well aware of it.  Not sure what to expect from sharing, I've just spent a day looking up possible working opportunity things you'd need to work abroad and found out you need to be under 30 and or have a job offer and most require a bachelor's to even be considered.  I'm not a stupid person and I feel like I've basically just wasted my life because I've never really seen any point in this all.  Never has a desire to travel because most of my 20's I was the stoner with no ambition, but could make a pipe out of anything.  I guess coming to self realization that I've missed a lot of life that I'm now wanting to explore.  \n\nPerhaps there are still avenues I could take to still do work exchange abroad, but I'm just not seeing them yet. \n\nTldr; basically late 30's realizing I missed a lot on travel work opportunities wishing I had been more proactive at doing things in my earlier years, also wishing I had saved more money so I could do things I enjoy now.  \n\nAny ideas or thoughts would be helpful.  A bit scary to be vulnerable but really feeling a bit like I just need help with options I may be unaware of.",

Today I saw a friendship post about dee conversations and it said ask eachother what would your life be like if I wasn't in it. I tried to think of my friends, especially the ones I've made the past few years. My life would be very different: I'd be lonely, probably wouldn't have started a medication, wouldn't have as much fun as I did, wouldn't have been to a few cool places, etc. \n\nBut then I tried to picture if from their POV, and honestly, I don't bring anything to their lives. I don't drive, and don't have a car. I also never plan anything. I just show up places I'm invited to, if that. The fact that they've even stayed around this long is a miracle. I have tried setting gatherings up, but I can't cook as well as them either and don't have that much money to throw a party.\n\nAnyway, I think I genuinely haven't made any impact in anyone's life these past few years except maybe an on and off boyfriend. My girl friends, though? Nothing. I definitely want to do more and be a better friend, but I don't know how. Because I thought it was enough just to not be cruel and mean, and be kind and understanding. I can't take them places, I don't know about many adventures as I'm an introverted homebody who gets dragged places (but ends up loving being outdoors?!), etc. \n\nI wanna be memorable, dependable, and actually be an important presence in a few friends' lives...

      "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\n  \nJust to get started, I'm a 23 year old Male from the UK looking to move out of my town (small town in lincolnshire) asap and I've been so stuck on what to do or where to relocate to for a long time. I have essentially no bills other than a 1 grand bank loan im paying back, phone bill, tiny amount of rent, car bills etc. I have absolutely outgrown my environment, most of my closes friends have moved away so I am ready to move myself as staying in this place for any longer simply isn't an option for me.\n\nMy first idea was to settle down somewhere in the uk (Leeds or Manchester) and start a career in marketing or try and get myself into some type of automotive media, content creation or marketing as I'm massively into my cars and I really enjoy photography, editing and generally being a creative. I am also really into my electronic music (old school 90's hard house/trance etc) and I do DJ as a hobby however It would be nice to potentially put myself in a place where the opportunity could come to play in front of an actual crowd. This is why I had the idea of Leeds and Manchester as these seem to suit my needs pretty perfectly.\n\nMy second Idea was to move abroad and settle down somewhere that is warm, hopefully near the beach with a nice nightlife. This doesn't have to be for ages, could be only 6 months to a year or maybe more (fingers crossed) and have a complete switch up of lifestyle in a warmer climate or even just another country (I get pretty horrible seasonal depression or maybe its just England). Of course theres the main ones like Melbourne, Australia Phuket, Thailand etc etc and these do seem very very appealing to me but I am worried that the grass may not be always greener. I also done some research and I really like the idea of Cyprus. More specifically near Ayia Napa. The country itself seems like there  a decent amount to do with mountains and even skiing (I really enjoy nature walks and am good at skiiing) and of course the weather and nightlife. For me it would be finding work (remote marketing) to help with this but I am half way there and I also do have a side husstle which helps which is remote. I've also been looking at other places such as spain, italy, croatia and even Canada (I know its not warm but I love the nature of the place). Also looked into Switzerland.\n\n  \nMy final option is to not really care about my preferences and just kinda go travelling in Asia, Canada, Australia or even somehwere else. This will kinda get rid of the stress of the 'perfect scenario' and put myself out of my comfort zone to try new experiences. I also have had my eye on other countries also such as Finland, Switzerland, Iceland and maybe try to connect with nature more as I in a huge mental rut and just always glued to my phone.  I could do this and then maybe come back and move to a place in the UK I want and THEN maybe focus on my career etc. Or I may love where I am and stay? You never know.\n\nI'm at the point in my life where I am just fed up overthinking myself into oblivion as it's pretty much ruining my life and I cannot get anything productive done. I have been thinking about this for 2 years now and I deep down know something NEEDS to change. I need to put myself in places that aligns with who I am and what I want in life. Please any opinions on this or any suggestions will be so so helpful. Thank you!",

However, every time I go back for the holidays I feel a heart wrenching feeling but I do not know if it is because of the semi-toxic parents I got. I have also come to look forward to coming back so I can sense I have come accustomed to life here. On the other hand, winters are brutal for me and I know for a fact I would live with a higher quality of life in my home country than here (since I am technically ‘starting a new life’ here as an immigrant)\n\nHence, I want to ask people whom have moved to another country or stayed somewhere after their studies ended: how did you know you wanted to stay (aside from the obvious better life you would have)? I did not know I would miss my family as much as I do now (specially seeing them grow older is a lot emotionally) so I am confused as to whether I want to stay or if I want to go back.

I'll still send him a text every once in a while, but I don't think we're ever going to be as close as we used to.\n\nAnother friend I made online back in 2021 on a language exchange website. We used to do a video chat every week for about a year and a half. I got a part-time job where I had to work early mornings and our times didn't sync up anymore. We stopped talking. He still asks if I want to video chat, but honestly I feel everything is so full with school, my part-time job, my hobbies, family, and just relaxing, that I don't really want to put in the effort anymore. I've basically started fading that friendship as well.\n\nI have a core group of friends in my band, and I intend to stick with them as much as possible, but I'm sure if one day the band breaks up that we'll probably go our separate ways as well. Friendships rarely last forever, I think. My brother and me will always be close though, I'm glad I have him.\n\nI know my dad is in his 60s and still has a couple friends from high school.

Others look almost exactly unchanged today!!\n- in this show, the social issues back then were in some ways different to today, in other ways not so much\n- Far more yellow cabs back then, than you see today in Manhattan, at least when I’ve been there\n- decor standards in homes\n- office styles\n- furniture styles\n- tech like boomboxes and cassette tape Walkman’s \n\nIt’s interesting to me, going back to watch older media, the even sometimes subtle differences time makes on things like the above bullet list. Especially when we realize how old we were back then. \n\nCase in point when this series first aired: I was five and a half years old. I’m 39 now. Where did the time go? It definitely did a wallop on the world around me. Some things for the better. Others didn’t change or changed for the worse. It makes me curious where time will take us in 40 more years from now where we’ll look back and say “I remember those times.

      "selftext": "so where do I begin...\n\nmy SIL has a daughter 8 months older than my daughter. My husband and SIL have a little sister who is almost 13. Throughout our daughters first 4 years of life SIL's daughter would snatch off other kids, boss them around, get whatever she wanted whenever she wanted, beat my daughter to toys to get them first, SIL would let her pull everything out of cupboards, fridges and didn't stop her. her daughter would throw things everywhere the things she took out of cupboards and fridges ect. For example I was changing my daughter on the change mat and I asked SIL to get me an outfit and her daughter was pulling all the coat hangers and clothes out of the cupboard and threw them all up the hallway and SIL did not teach her not to do it she just said nothing, didn't even pick them up and put them away. She used to drink from the mayonnaise bottle and my husband loves mayonnaise and he tried to take it off her and said no yucky and SIL told him to stop leave her alone she's only little and then SIL put her finger up and said \"you tell him, tell uncle, you don't tell me what to do\" so 1.5-2 year old gibberish put her finger up and copied her mum. It go to the point i was too anxious every time we hung out. my husband used to say things like \"what am i suppose to do, thats my sister\". SIL's daughter would snatch off husbands almost 13 year old sister but at the time was probably 8,9,10. SIL's daughter would tantrum so SIL would yell at almost 13 year old \"JUST GIVE IT TO HER\", it was this way ALL DAY every time we seen them and she would snatch of my daughter and SIL got frustrated when i wouldn't put up with it. one time almost 13 year old had a school disco but SIL was over at her mums house at the time and her daughter tantrumed because she didn't want her to go so guess what... poor almost 13 year old had to miss out and her mum and sister made her stay home.\n\nI ended up keeping my distance and I apologised to MIL for not coming over when she is there and explained why and she said things like \"kids will be kids\", \"as a mother i just dont understand\". my husband ended up going over there to talk to SIL because he wanted to talk it out and be honest with her. my SIL ripped it at him, she verbally abused the crap out of him. We ended up not talking to her. then a year later we gave her another chance and she came over and SIL was on her best behaviour. BUT... she ended up doing other harmful and hurtful things to us. It got so bad i ended up blocking her off everything. my MIL defends her and she always enables her toxic behaviour.\n\nwhat I haven't mentioned yet is that my husband has mental health issues due to his dad being suicidal growing up, he is the oldest one so he felt he had to protect his siblings, his mum would leave them home alone with their explosive dad who came home drunk, husband cut ropes off trees, dragged his dad by the legs saying \"no don't do it\" while his dad yelled at his mum \"Im going to do it\" , his mum and dad would argue because of the dads mental health and they have been to about 15 different schools, they grew up in a very unstable environment. I didn't realise how bad it was until after we had kids when his childhood trauma came out.\n\nMy husband developed agoraphobia. he was house bound with major panic attacks. been on a few different meds with no progression. His mental health declined so much and the only arguments we ever had was because of his family. which i think caused him to decline over time. His mum would never visit us, never help if we asked for help. the help we asked for was for example I couldn't leave the kids home alone with him because of how bad his panic attacks where and it was 6pm my husband forgot to tell me he ran out of meds so he had non left, he asked his mum if she can get more and she asked if i could do it and he said shes getting the kids ready for bed and shes tried she isnt up to leave with the kids right now, she would then either make something up so she could get out of it or say say something like \"i feel like im giving in and enabling you if i do it\". The times she actually was busy she said in a happy tone that she cant because she's got to do such and such.\n\nfast forward to we had to move as the owners where selling the house. his mum called me and said she thinks its best if he moves in with her for the time being she said she thinks thats would be the only way he will get better. his anxiety was so bad, i couldn't give the kids a bath without him panicking about when or how long it would take for the bath water to drain, he panicked when he was home alone and i had to take the kids out with me every time i left the house. i thought wow she actually wants to help.\n\nMy husband and I had a chat about everything and he said he's happy to as he also doesn't want me to stress like i have been and be in that environment. It's been about 6 ish weeks since that has happened. His family are only making him even more worse. I don't particularly want him home just yet and he said he's not ready as he's said again he doesn't want to disappoint me, he doesn't want to cause a stressful environment but the way his mum and step dad are being is making him unmotivated and worse. so I also don't want him to stay in that environment either. his mum is on his back all the time, he was doing things around the house like yard work, cleaning the pool, cleaned all the aircon's he cleaned them out and washed them out and he picks up dog piss and poop since he mother cant be bothered potty training them. theres literally nothing to do as they have him and his brother cleaning up and making dinner while their parents are at work and the way they have been talking to him makes him on the unmotivated side so he has times where he does sit in his room.\n\nMy husband was telling me how everyone is on his back, how he will spend time in his room but come out sometimes, he says he will help out but the second he's in his room they get angry at him. his step dad uses his trailer with out asking him, popped a tired still hasnt fixed it, he also has headphones he doesn't use so my husband uses them and his step dad walked into the room and snatched it off him. i spoke to his mum saying i think his step dad is expecting too much from him he's not coping, even though he may seem like it on the outside he's not coping. she agreed with me and was very nice to me and said she spoke to his step dad about being less harsh. \n\ni went over there the next day, and his mum was practically verbally abusing him saying how he's talked himself into this condition, he's self diagnosed himself and when my husband said no a psychiatrist diagnosed me, she said well you would of had to talk about the symptoms and talk yourself into it. then the next day i get a text message about how its not fair on her that he's still living there, then said he doesn't do anything to help out (he does but maybe not as much as they would like but come on i don't blame him when he's being spoken to like this and always has been spoken to this way), she said his brother is the only one who helps (but its funny how when its convenient to her she will tell me no one helps her out, i have been over many times when they are at work and they are cleaning up and dinner is on the stove and she comes home and has a smoke, there step dad comes home and has a smoke and demands \"clean the pool\") she said her back is sore, its not fair that she does everything and supporting 4 adults. I'm sorry but your the one allowing 4 adults to live there, one of them needs your support. she also made it sound like my husband is such a burden that they will sell the house and move to a smaller place with just them and their almost 13 year old. she also said that the kids must miss him and that her kids struggled with their dad being in the hospital... no they struggled because you left them home alone with drunk, suicidal him, left my husband as the oldest trying to protect his siblings and you fighting with him in front of the kids all the time.\n\ni replied saying that we are working with a therapist and she doesn't think its the right time for him to come back, that my daughter is starting school and my son a new kindy and having him home will only stress me out, he will backslide and it will ruin the progress we have already made in our marriage as only a few weeks ago i was also ready for divorce, that the kids have finally gotten used to him not being around and i don't want to ruin the progress and hes not ready, hes already told me.\n\nshe never replied. the next day i find out that she's had another go at my husband saying how can it be from trauma, its not from trauma why doesn't your brother and sister have it? then she tells him that Im not welcome there because i have treated his sister and her badly. My husband is at a compete loss with what to do. his mum lives on a bit of land where i live on something a lot smaller and he thinks being house bound here will also make him a bit worse because he will feel claustrophobic but once he takes a new medication he needs to take hoping it will help calm him down, he's speaking with a doctor and also a therapist. \n\nill also ad we had other issues before like he found a game that took his mind off things so was on that all day and wasn't present and i felt he wasn't working hard enough to get better. so i also don't want him to play that game all day if he comes back so I'm not so sure I'm ready. but our marriage has been better lately as a whole with the therapy I'm petrified him moving back that things wont work out as it might be too soon but also petrified of him staying in that environment.\n\nIm not ready to give up just yet as hes already said he needs to do what he can to leave the household and hes about to start a new medication and i do believe he will heal eventually.",

About me being expected to do most of the cooking for Christmas dinner, and my mom having set an expectation that my brother is not expected to help purchase anything for it or cook.  Long post will probably convince those that suggested therapy that I should go, and I may try to make that work in 2025.  If not interested doomscroll on . . . \n\nAbout the parental favoritism, I do know that.  It has been clear for many years and colors everything I was feeling about this.  I used to try to figure out what I could do to change it, but have given up.\n\nI had also forgotten my parents' communication styles.  When I posted I had already expressed my feelings to my mom, but they don't respond to feelings just being expressed in a mild style.  With each other they typically emphasize their feelings by snapping, silent treatment, or even slamming things, to get them considered.  I am a milennial and personally don't like doing any of those things; I'd rather someone just respond when I say, \"This is bothering me and I'd like a solution.\"  She didn't really respond with any changes.\n\nI was out of touch with my own emotions and after reading the replies, accidentally cried in front of them about something else important to me that they were ignoring.  This led to a talk where there were some actual changes made.  I expressed firmly that I think it needs to change that they do a lot to support him, but he does very little to support them.  (Crying is not my preferred method of expressing myself.  Unfortunately, they just don't really respond to feelings unless something is done to emphasize them.  Oops, I cried.  They responded.)  I also got my mom to agree to help me set an expectation that next time, my brother is to buy some small things.\n\nOne good thing that came out of it is that my dad's attitude to me, after I pointed this out, has completely changed for the better.  Even the tone he speaks to me in is different; he acts like I'm more welcome around.  He would say I was before but his attitude was that I was tolerated.  I think he genuinely did not know how much of the work I was doing, and how much my mom was doing.  This is not an excuse.  I am happy for the change though, because the way he was really bothered me.\n\nNow on to my brother.  First, I do think the expectation to help needs to be placed on him because we're his family of origin, even though it would be easier to talk to his wife about it.  Secondly, I had said he does cook -- but I overestimated that because he talks a lot about it.  I actually asked him to \"get\" a pot that was boiling over because my hands were full and he was closer to the stove, and he didn't know what to do.  (I don't know how he didn't know, because I know he at least boils rice, and beans, but he didn't.)  \n\nWhen he left, he thanked my parents profusely but not me -- so I think he did not know either how much I was putting into it rather than just them.  (He texted me later.  Something may have been said by them.)  This is why I was hesitant to be the one to say anything to him -- he sees it as their hospitality (Christmas dinner was held in the house where we both grew up) and to him, I would be interfering.  And why I need my mom's support in setting an expectation.  \n\nHe actually makes it difficult to ask for his help because he is so profuse in his thanks, and this may be something that my dad was holding against me -- I say \"thanks\" briefly and put in the work, he says it effusively and doesn't do anything.  \n\nHe always has some excuse, though, why he doesn't, say, come out and help with yard work.  Either he needs to do some more work or his wife wants to do something or my parents don't communicate well when he's actually working with them (that's surmountable).  My dad showed him some things that need to be done after a fairly recent storm when he was here for Christmas, and it didn't seem to register that it was a request for him to set a work date.  But my dad seems encouraged by the idea that maybe he WOULD be able to come to help (since I suggested it).  \n\nSo it's like, \"I can't support you, I can't be available for that, but thank you SO MUCH for being SO supportive of me because you do a LOT for me, and I appreciate it.\"  That's my brother's attitude.  And that is ok with my parents but it is not ok with me for that to be his attitude toward them.  They are getting older and it needs to change.   He forgot when my mom's major surgery was this year, asked my dad to help him with something that day instead of driving her a couple of hours to it, tells them he wouldn't have time to attend their funerals, constantly tells them he's \"gonna need\" their financial support and time, and criticizes me when they offer support to me.  It looks really stark when I put it all together in one place like this and I had to be this harsh and stark with my mom to get a response.  \n\nI have some work to do on communication and setting expectations with him, but I feel like the emotions surrounding it were resolved.  Christmas went pretty well after my parents and I were able to talk, which was a couple of days before.  ",

      "selftext": "When I think about this question, I always go back to the times I’ve spent as a stay at home mom in my life. There were two distinct times, once for each child. The last one in particular was less for my child and more for my mental and emotional health. I had been teaching for 5 years and after having her I had been suffering terrible mental health problems. We were in a good enough place financially my husband could carry us while I sought a diagnosis and healed. So I took three years off work. \n\nDuring those times, my sole goals were to take care of the kids, house, run the whole show pretty much, and the last one, finish my grad degree. But I also had a lot of free time and by that I mean, no restriction of time. I was always busy but never in a deadline crunch kind of way. I took up gardening, crochet, volunteered in my daughter’s preschool class and other classes as a sub, studied, etc. I had a lot of time to do things I WANTED to do. Things that were feeding me mentally/emotionally.\n\nBut now, Ive been back to work for two years and the grind is even worse than before. This new school I’m at is pretty good and my girls go there too and my eldest has flourished. There are several good things about this decision. But even with my husband’s new job with better hours, all we do is work, do home chores, and prepare for the next day, and I’m balancing my physical and mental health with all that. I have legit fallen asleep while doing pelvic floor stretches before because I was so exhausted. I barely have time to even read at night before I pass out. Self care? Who has time for that? Let alone things like all the ones I listed above that I enjoy doing.\n\nBut enough with the background. What are some practical things you do that help combat the grind? I want my time on this earth to be meaningful. And yes, I count my job and my husband’s job as meaningful (teacher and crime scene investigator) but they are exhausting. I don’t bring work home anymore. I have limited time when I come home and I want it to be recharging for me, not more chores and crap to do.\n\nIs there a different way to structure things? Some kind of prep or system that I don’t know or haven’t tried? Do we just say fuck it and let things go? Or is this just the reality of school age children? When I ask my mom she just says woe is you, it sucks to be a mom. Which is not helpful obviously.",

      "selftext": "Trigger Warning depression related \n\nHeya all, so for quite some time now, years really, on and off, I've been going through some very strong patches of emotion at work.\n\nTo explain my job, I work managing a independent liquor & grocery store. I get a long decently well with all of my staff. I typically work 5am up to about 3pm, sometimes 4pm, Monday to Friday, and I work 5 hours on Saturdays. I travel about an hour each way, to and home from work. \n\nI tend to find myself having a pretty severe temper most days. I feel like I can often snap or have an outburst (under my breath, into a jumper or in a private place), some of these are nonstop spells of swearing or quite hate filled comments. I do get very angry with people over innocuous things, like them walking in my way, or asking questions that interfere with my ability to continue to work. I get very angry about small mistakes made by employees, though I don't go to them and critique them about minute mistakes. My response though is a surge of rage. \n\nI find myself often feeling glum, very heavy in the face, and flat emotionally by the end of work days. I've tried everything, from going for short walks to give myself a break from work (I don't take or have lunch breaks, but I do get paid for skipping them). I've had weeks with an additional day or such off and I still find myself enraged. \n\nThe work itself is the same each week. Mostly a mix of managing a team, delegating, following up on work, placing orders, talking with sales representatives, answering phone calls from both customers and companies. Merchandising, printing off tickets, unpacking stock, submitting footage to police of theft, inventorying, managing our social media and online inventory for online orders (menulog). I mostly know that things do not go according to plan, people not turning up, or calling out sick happen every now and then, or something takes time out of the day. I can't help though but to let that make me nearly explode with rage each time it happens. \n\nI sometimes dream about my workplace, and they're often nightmares. Otherwise I've been thinking often about dark humor, like what if I were to hang myself at my workplace, usually this thought hits me when I'm raging or very frustrated. \n\nI should mention I've got mild ADHD. \n\nI would like some advice from anyone who has gone through a similar situation? Is this normal? When I say normal, is it typical for someone with ADHD to feel this way with a management job? Or do you feel its normal for someone working 55-60 hours a week? I don't have much perspective as it's been the only full time job I've worked, and my father basically told me that he has been the same way at many jobs he's had when he's worked 5-6 days a week. People always say that work sucks and it seems to be every field, so I'm not sure if it's just normal and I tend to be more severe with how I express it within myself?\n\n\n\nTL;DR: there isn't one, can't be concise enough for such a thing here.

I've hear the surgery is horrible so I've been putting it off and hoping for the best.\n\nI've been doing okay, until now. I went to urgent care today because my throat is KILLING ME. I was diagnosed with the flu, negative strep (and apparently negative flu too but the urgent care doc said it sounds like I have the flu, so flu it is.) Now I have that white crap in the back of my throat, but I dont think it's stones. I tried to \"pop\" it and all I got was mucousy stuff and it made my tonsils bleed. It's never been this bad.\n\nSo no chronic strep or actual diagnosed bacterial infections, but several issues this year. I also got diagnosed with sleep apnea earlier this year and I've wondered if a tonsillectomy would help with that.\n\nSo, those of you who have had a tonsillectomy as an adult - worth it or nah? The horror stories I've seen about recovery scare me a ton but this shit just ain't worth the pain.",

      "selftext": "Basically the title. I (42M) have a great family at home…our kids are 10 and 14 now. Other than that, I feel so isolated. I am a teacher and mostly enjoy my job…not 100% sure if I’m going to keep doing it forever… but then I just get kind of bored and depressed over breaks, like now since we’re off for the holidays.\n\nI know it’s not seen as “normal” or “essential” for us guys like it is for a lot of ladies, but I feel like if I at least had a few friends to talk to/text, maybe it would help pass the time and make my life, outside of my family more stimulating, lol…\n\nLike my wife has a BFF that she met when our kids were friends in preschool…they are texting and telling each other everything all the time. My younger one still hangs out with them, but my older one has stopped. Our families do things together sometimes, but it’s just kinda awkward for me. I have a little bit in common with the husband/dad of the family, but the more we got to know each other I just kind of find him odd.\n\nI have had good friends at times in my life. Usually not that many at a time, but enough that I had people to talk to and hang out with.\n\nI had a best friend in elementary school. He  was a little younger, but very intelligent and we had a lot of good times. We used to keep in touch occasionally on FB, but he pretty much quit using it a few years ago. I know he lives across the country now and not a lot else.\n\nIn college, I got to be very good friends with my roommate…we roomed together the entire time and got pretty close despite coming from pretty different backgrounds. His family lived a lot closer than mine, and they basically treated me (and my parents when they visited at the same time) like part of the family. We text each other a few times a year still. We always remember to text on each other’s birthdays, but the conversation usually doesn’t go too far otherwise.\n\nIn grad. school, I had one friend who was there for my first couple of years. We were studying music (not what I teach now). We chat on occasion, but usually just if we see something on each other’s FB that’s relevant for whatever reason.\n\nMy last few years of music school, I played with a small group on a daily basis and of course we got to know each other pretty well. They scattered to different corners of the country…New York, LA, Ohio… one is actually still living with his husband not far away. There are few of them that, again, I’d love to keep in better touch with. I do text a couple of them on occasion.\n\nHow do you keep the conversation going and not fall out of touch? Or, how do you get to know people when you have busy lives and no time/money to hang out with other adults?",

I drove the two hours and spent about 30 minutes sitting by their grave looking through photos of them on my phone. I suppose I could have done the same thing at home, but I think there was something cathartic about traveling to where they lived. I think next year I will go on the 24th and have a meal at one of the restaurants we used to go to and use hotel points to stay overnight.   \n\nI really appreciate all the people that commented. Everyone posted something thoughtful. One of the things it showed I should not feel guilt if I do not go, as many have said they really are not there. Others said they feel visiting gives them peace. I am not sure what I feel right now, I suppose I am glad I went. \n\nIn any case, my parents were married on Dec. 25, 1963, so I thought going on Christmas would be a good day. My mom actually died on Dec. 26, 2015 we are in the USA, so we don't really do Boxing Day here. My dad died Jan. 2, 2024. So kind of a tough time of year all around. I will see next year. From all the comments, either way I choose is just fine. ",

      "selftext": "To really get to the bottom of my story- I am one of 7, the 2nd youngest- a 25f. My mom is 65f and my dad is 75m and a lot of my siblings are special needs. Three are autistic and one is special needs. In fact, we suspect that on both sides of my family, both my grandmothers were autistic before the label was ever widely given to anyone. I suspect my dad and my mom could be as well.\n\n My mom homeschooled all of us before it was really a thing, but to be honest it was less homeschooling and more handing us paperwork for us to fill out because she never followed up and interacted with us much with schoolwork. My dad was never really present when I was little because he worked all day and would hunker down with a book as soon as he got home. I never really got to know him much until I became a teenager.\n\n We never really went out much as I was growing up, and my mom told us all that people didn't like us because we were special and that people were jealous of us. We never interacted with many other people, except for church events and the occasional field trip. We all lived in the same small house until we all eventually moved out- I was on top of two of my sisters in a 12x13 bedrooom for years even into adulthood. All seven of us were rubbing shoulders all the way until I moved out. My mom would always get angry when people wouldn't invite us to private events and say really nasty things behind their backs but then be completely amiable to their face. It became a common occurrence for her to blame everyone for not talking or socializing to us. It felt like she was victimizing us all the time, and our problems were never actually ours, just everone elses.\n\n To this day, its really strange to me that my mom will roast even her really close friends to my face, accusing them of not caring about her and not talking to her and then when they are next together, all is well again. I know her friends are somewhat aware of her unusual behaviour, but I am completely bewildered as to why they would tolerate this two sided behaviour.\n\nNow as an adult, I find it really hard not to be bitter with my mom. She and my dad were older parents and things were probably harder on them because they had two sets of children with different age ranges. But compared to other people my age, it feels like I have had very little to reflect on my childhood as having been pleasant and spent more times wishing I was in a happier less congested and problematic household. Every parent-child relationship I have met since moving out seems more amiable and easy then mine. I hate how emotionally and socially stunted I am because of what I think is this upbringing.  \n\nI long moved out, and I am on pleasant terms with my parents but when I visit them for the holidays from out of town, my parents will gaslight me into spending all of my time with them, but they will do nothing but watch tv and have me clean. I don't  mind helping but it feels like staying trapped at home all the time and not socializing wasn't because they had seven kids but because they were just too lazy now. Nothing has changed.\n\nDoes my overall dissatisfaction mean anything? I know being upset doesn't solve anything, but I have no idea how to change this weird cycle of pessimism that my mom continually has of other people. Does anyone have any advice?",

A little 100 piece kit that built a 727 became a tiny fleet of freaking combat starships. Bits from other sets found their way in there to anchor what used to be a simple turbine but is now a STAR FUSION THRUSTER into place in the fleet command cruiser. Pieces were deliberately missing from the build to mimic crippling battle damage as I swooshed about the house screaming around tight turns in some silly canyon maneuvering battle scene. I found a pivoting piece from some other crappy pile of thrift-store lego and oh my god I now had retractable landing gear. The tailpiece became the base of a ground-affixed anti-aircraft turret mount...\n\n....on and on and on. Hours and hours of repurposing imaginative fun. Even in my late teens I would still grab some horky looking starship and frig around with a new \"weapon layout\" and viusalize it Battlestar Galactica-ing through some horde of mismatched junk ships.\n\nNowadays I look at my son's lego model shelf and see that the five-year-old Star Wars model stuff there with a thousand pieces and oh, so many interesting reusable shapes.... is untouched since its original build and has accumulated a layer of fine dust. It's pretty much the equivalent of having  been Kragled in place.\n\nLego when I was a kid, and even a young adult, was a playground. Now it's a piece of Ikea furniture but more expensive without an allen key and you can't sit on it afterward.\n\nMerry grumpy Christmas. :o)",

      "selftext": "Trying to work out my feelings about this.  My brother said today, \"Just tell us what time you want us there\" and criticized the menu and the time.  \n\nIt upset me more than . . . more than I expected.  They already aren't putting in any of the work, aren't bringing a dish, aren't helping to buy of the groceries.  It will be the first year I have done most of the cooking instead of my mom, although I don't remember a year we celebrated that I didn't do some of it.  \n\nMy parents want it to feel like they don't have to (but they definitely expect it of me, it goes without saying that I will be working to make the dinner happen).  I think they are afraid that if their expectations are too high, their family will just not come.  \n\nWe have already been preparing and will have been preparing for days.  The whole morning of course I will spend cooking and there wasn't really an option for another time.  I feel like I am doing all of this for my parents' relationship with my brother, and although my brother sees me in the kitchen doing the work, I don't think it registers to him that this is NOT just my parents' hospitality.  And I think if anything were to be said that the work at least is mostly mine, he would feel I am coming between him and them.  \n\nI'm not saying it wouldn't happen without me.  But the meal would be much less, fewer dishes, fewer favorites that have been selected just for someone (mostly for members of their family).  \n\nI don't like it.  Maybe I want to be appreciated.  Maybe I want to feel I have some say in their visits.  I definitely want him to understand that his parents need his support as they get older.  I live much closer; but it's not really long travel for him, about an hour.  \n\nEarlier this year I invited my brother for dinner after my mom had a major surgery, so they could spend some time and he could see that she was doing well.  He got offended that I didn't urge for his wife to come too.  (I did ask if she was coming and if I needed to adjust the menu for her.  She didn't like what I was already planning to make for Mom that night.)  It was easier to cook for just one extra, and I was caring for my mom after surgery.  I can see that he wanted her to be welcome, but it was the way the conversation went -- he wasn't appreciating that it was my invitation and my work going into his relationship with his mom, only that I was saying something that he felt was . . . I guess not putting as much work into his wife's relationship with his mom.  \n\nMy mom needs the help.  She is just not up to doing a whole Christmas dinner.  But I feel not just taken for granted, I feel used.  To make it worse, I don't want to rub it in to my mom that I'm doing a lot, because she will feel bad that she can't do more this year.  \n\nAnd if you want to know why the difference -- why am I expected to do most of it and they are not expected to do anything?  I don't even know.  It's PARTLY gender but not all of it.  They do cook.  My mom wants to do a lot for him, special things like making his favorite dishes.  It's just that I will likely be making them and she will be getting the credit.  \n\nI don't even know what to do about my resentment.  \n\nEDIT: thanks for the thoughtful and supportive replies!  They helped me think through what I really want to change about this.  It’s not really that I want to cancel Christmas dinner if they don’t help with it.  It’s more that I want him to think in terms of supporting our parents instead of being supported — bringing a meal, for instance, when Mom has surgery instead of coming to eat one.  It’s more of an issue of supporting them in general than it is a holiday issue.  I don’t know that he realizes this is needed and I’ll be thinking through how to tell him.\n\nEDIT 2: I am coming back for an update but needed a few days off from this.",

I am now the manager at that store, but I really don't want to stay in Nashville. It's just too expensive and there's not really much here for me. I also wouldn't mind doing something new for work.\n\nMy lease is up in 2 months and I am probably going to move back to the city I left. I would transfer back to my old store in a lower position, but my current boss is going to be heavily inconvenienced by me leaving Nashville because there is nobody to replace me. Nobody from another store has ever transferred to our store for a management position. She also runs the stores in the city I'm moving back to, so working under her over there would just be awkward.\n\nI'm thinking of taking a short break when I get there. 3 to 6 months to pursue personal interests, do some short road trips, and figure out if I want to stay there or move somewhere else. My rent would be half what it is in Nashville, and I have $35,000 saved right now. I obviously don't want to blow through all of it, but I also don't mind going through some of it. And its in a city where I still know a decent amount of people who, if I decided to stick around longer, could probably connect me to job opportunities.\n\nHas anyone done something like this? Was it beneficial? Was it a huge mistake? \n\nI'm pretty determined to move whether or not I find a job before moving. The idea of taking a breather popped into my head a couple days ago and it sounds more appealing the more I think about it.",

I confront them about things I believe are wrong, and they say I've been \"brainwashed\" by college into thinking it's cool to argue and yell. My parents are very loving and have made a lot of sacrifices for us, but they have their own issues too. The fights have become really toxic, and I never realized how bad it was until I went to college.\n\nI started therapy with a woman I work for—she pays me, and the money covers my sessions. I’ve had about 8 sessions now, but they don’t seem to be helping. Her advice feels rational, but it’s not connecting with how I feel. I feel miserable and sometimes take out my anger on my younger brother, which makes me feel even worse. I can’t leave because I’m financially dependent on my parents, and I feel so lost.\n\nAny advice or support would mean a lot.",

      "selftext": "I guess what they don't tell you about mental health, healing, and growth is that spending time around the same toxic, dysfunctional people from your past eventually becomes intolerable. \n\nMy mother is a narcissist. I know that term gets tossed around a lot, but after 5+ years of both individual and joint therapy, and the therapist during my teens confirming her diagnosis, she most definitively is one. She presents as incredibly friendly and bubbly on the outside, but it's another story behind closed doors. Moving halfway around the world (and staying away) for university and my own career is the only thing that saved my sanity. It also took a bad marriage, where similar patterns/dynamics occurred, for me to do even more inner work. Since my divorce last year, I've spent SO much time focusing on my mental health, and learning how to be a mentally sound person. And I guess I've reached that point where I (quite literally) cannot stand or tolerate being around her toxicity and dysfunction for the holidays........ because even though I just arrived in the tropics three days ago, I've just booked a flight home back up north, where it's cold and blustery. I was supposed to stay here for another week, but I couldn't fathom sticking around for another week. \n\nRefunds for my original travel plans are in progress, so at least I'm getting some of my money back, and trying to get full refunds. But, even so....... can't put a price on mental health. All I want is to be back home in my own apartment, in my own bed, and surrounded by my own loving, supportive community of friends. Throughout this year, I found an incredible new group of friends & community that have truly become like family -- I've bonded with many of them so closely, even more closely than with my own biological family. I'm also due to start a new job during the first week of the new year, and just moved into a new place two weeks ago, and am still not fully unpacked and settled. Going home early will give me the opportunity to continue settling in and being mentally prepared to start my new job.\n\nI guess this is part of the journey of adulting. ",

Oh btw you also might have to witness them dying in school\"\n\nSeems like the only thing I have to look forward to are those Alien sightings and UFO videos (I mean...

      "selftext": "My dad’s church had one (he’s a pastor) for their church office. An old school 9-key touch tone. The typical AT&T drab putty colored rented phone. \n\nThey hadn’t actually connected it in years, and had long since switched to cordless phones. But one day dad took a closer look at the phone bill and realized there had been a small rental fee on the invoice. Going back through records he noticed it had been that way for decades. He quickly realized the old touch tone office phone sitting in a closet was being rented from AT&T!!\n\nSo he cleaned it up, plugged it into the line to test that it still worked (it did), and took it to the nearest AT&T store  to return it and end the rental agreement (cancel at any time situation I guess). \n\nThe clerk at the store was so confused. Dad said she had to get the manager who was also confused. They had no clue people still had these! So they ended up calling corporate who had to ask one of the few legacy folks still there who knew how to process rental landline phone returns and walk them through how to process the return. Dad said it was one of the most comical days he’d had and they all laughed about it when it was all done. ☎️ \n\nMy family never rented these when we had a landline. Dad just always got a cheap landline phone from Walmart to hang on the jack in the wall in the kitchen with the super long spiral cord so you could walk out of the kitchen and go sit at the dining room table to talk if you wanted. (We thought we moved up in the world when we got our first cordless set!)\n\nHas anyone else dealt with rented landline phones in their past? I didn’t know those were a thing until Dad told me about that story a few years ago. I just always assumed everyone bought them from the phone company or the phone company just furnished them as a package deal with service back in the day. ",

People are asking themselves, “‘What does that say about our society? Where’s our society going?’”\n3. “The disconnect between public perception and personal humanity has been striking, with some commentary bordering on dehumanizing. This highlights the critical need to humanize leadership and address the pressures faced in high-visibility roles.” \n4. “My challenge is keeping employees engaged. How do you maintain a sense of purpose if you think your customers hate you?”\n5.  “I have to wonder if the demonization of corporate America and the wealthy over the last four years planted a mind virus in the assassin’s mind.”\n6. “If you walk by the place where it happened, it’s business as usual, which gives me some perspective. This was a random killing by a mentally ill person. Let’s not turn a tragic incident into a trend. Most people don’t hate CEOs. They don’t care about CEOs. They have bigger issues to care about.”\n7. “It’s hard to be aware of your surroundings. Everyone is looking at you, and you are not looking at them. You need that second set of eyes and someone who’s scanning the room for risks as you’re scanning it for customers, employees, and other people you want to meet.”\n8. “I sometimes get a bit annoyed at having security with me. It feels like a bit much. I mean, who would want to attack me? But I see the value in it. Being protected is part of the job.”\n9. “You’re never stopping anyone who wants to get to you.”\n10.  “When I was growing up, CEOs didn’t make millions more than everyone else in the company. I think we have to reflect on why there’s so much anger and do something about it.”\n11.  “I don’t think you could be a CEO and not have threats against your life, if you’re going through bankruptcy or have to reduce labor … There are people in Congress who want to ‘stick it to corporate America.’ Well, corporate America is made up of hardworking Americans who do their best to reward the investors, and many times those investors are pension funds.”\n12.  “I think we’re living through very seriously dangerous times where we’re normalizing antisocial behavior and normalizing violence on both extremes—on the far right, and on the far left. We basically moved, over the last 10 to 12 years, to a world that I don’t recognize. It’s very scary … I do understand that there’s enormous amounts of injustice and that we need to bring everybody along, and there’s a lot of things that we do, but I don’t think revolution is the answer to solving problems.”\n13. “Journalists look for heroes and villains; life is not that simple. Why is the killer getting 10 times as much press as the person who was killed?”",
