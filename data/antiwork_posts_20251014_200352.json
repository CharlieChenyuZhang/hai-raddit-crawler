      "selftext": "Im sitting in my car right now crying my eyes out. I've been at this company for 2 years as an analyst. It's been incredibly bumpy working at the company. At my previous jobs, I did incredible work and was told I was a joy to work with. Here, I felt like I was lied to and my training was sick or swim. I literally spent my own personal time doing excel and reviewing company resources.\n\nMy manager met with me today, and he told me he was disappointed I had missed an error that had been another team's responsibility for 5 months. Since I used to work on that error, I should have been able to figure it out, and he is questioning my basic knowledge foundation from my explanation. (He sent out a 4 month old email to the other team about a change for the error and CCed me) When I told him that okay I know the expectation moving forward he said I should have already known the expectation. It almost looked like on his face like a smirk or sneer when he said that. I asked what can we do from here about my position and I was told I should think about it and get back to him. \n\nAm I being pushed out? I've been told to get fired for unemployment rather than quit. How can I get them to fire me? (I have 3 job applications out right now, 1 might be promising) I'll be applying alot now but need advice so I am not fucked over. I also have my successful performance evaluations and evidence of bonuses received past two years.",

      "selftext": "so go here to learn my UBI economy plan. its a 20 minute video\n\nwell, i guess i wont debate, thats boring... but just say why you think my UBI economy plan is bad or wont work\n\ni highly think my ideas will work.. basically my idea is a 150k yearly UBI  for everyone who signs up, plus a labor draft, and more things too... my 20 minute manifesto video fully explains the plan\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/withawonder4president/comments/1o61a7x/withawonder\\_manifesto\\_part\\_2\\_join\\_the\\_revolution/](https://www.reddit.com/r/withawonder4president/comments/1o61a7x/withawonder_manifesto_part_2_join_the_revolution/)\n\nEDIT: i replied to someone to explain  my plan i guess. lol. so ill  post it here\n\nwell a TV show is 30 minutes. i highly think my ideas will work. you can i guess watch my video if you ever feel like learning my full plan.\n\nthe money would come from just printing it. fiat. and then the only tax would be as 15% sales tax. all income taxes and other taxes removed\n\nanyway i think i am very smart and i think this will work, but heres where the money comes from.\n\nbasically, every year the government will just print the money it needs for all programs including the UBI. and then every year the government takes in money from a 15% sales tax. and the money supply would increase alot, but eventually the money supply and flow would get so big that the 15% tax every year would take back in as much as the printing creates.\n\nso it would just be like a flowing money river that regulates itself. some years the government prints more, some years the government taxes more. it flows with the money supply, and the government would destroy all the money that comes in from taxes\n\nthere would be inflation, sure, but i think overall this ubi system would flow so much money to the poor  that it would work out. i dont think inflation would be that bad, and having a system that flows money to poor people i think is better than a system that doesnt\n\nbasically, my system flows money into poor people. i thnk that is much better than the current billionaire capitalism system which flows all the money into the billionaires like elon must or bezos .  so at least my system, on paper, in theory, is a system where the poor people are getting tons of money flow and government benefits. i think thats a good system. i think it makes sense to create a system where tons of money is flowing into poor people, instead of being flowed into billionaires\n\nthe real question is how do you make people work if they get free money. and my labor draft idea solves that problem. jobs would find people on UBI benefits and hire them, and they are required to work if on UBI\n\ni also have ideas explained in my manifesto video that solve the problem of debt, loans, mortgages, and college loans. my UBI idea includes full debt forgiveness and the government paying off all loans for poor people",

      "selftext": "May this be the year we stop pretending the madness makes sense.\n\nMay some of this bullshit finally burn away.\n\nThis prayer is not for patience. It is for resistance.\nThe end to this madness will not come from HR emails or town halls.\nIt will come from silence. From refusal. From saying no.\nStop buying what exploits you.\nStop feeding the systems that feed on you.\nBoycott the illusion of choice. Withdraw your clicks, your time, your loyalty.\nMay this be the year of quiet rebellion.\nMay illusion burn.\nMay work finally become human again.\n\n1. Return to office \"for community\" and \"values\" : when half the workforce is offshored.\nThey tell you to come back for “culture” while your entire cross-functional team is in another time zone.\nYou sit in traffic, pay for gas, lunches, and childcare, all to spend eight hours on Zoom with people in India or Poland.\n\n2. Companies like CVS, where most consumers are American but 80 percent of corporate is offshored.\nAmerican customers fund the business. American workers staff the stores.\nBut when it comes to salaries, benefits, and decision-making. It’s all moved overseas to save costs.\nThey call it “global efficiency.”\nWe call it hollowing out the middle class while selling prescriptions for the anxiety it causes.\n\n3. Recruiters for American positions who are not even based in America.\nThey’ll tell you it’s just logistics. That “talent is global.”\nBut these are jobs requiring U.S. knowledge, U.S. laws, U.S. taxes, U.S. hours, U.S. PI\nInstead of paying domestic recruiters a living wage, they offshore the role to someone who’s never lived the market they’re hiring for.\nIt’s not efficiency. It’s extraction dressed as opportunity.\n\n4. AI tools replacing human labor and the same companies calling it \"innovation.\"\nThey call it progress when they automate empathy, efficiency when they fire the humans who built the data that trained the machine.\nThey say we are freeing you for creative work, but offer no new roles, no safety net, just slogans about \"reskilling.\"\nThey replace us with algorithms trained on our own labor, our words, our keystrokes, and then charge us subscription fees to use what we created.\nThey call it innovation.\nWe call it cannibalism disguised as code.\n\n5. Contract work sold as “freedom.”\nThey say you’re “your own boss,” but you have no benefits, no sick days, no security, and no guarantee of tomorrow.\nManagers don’t want to hire you because you’ve “only done contract work,” even though that’s all that exists now.\nFull-time positions have quietly disappeared since 2020, replaced by rotating temps with no future, no healthcare, and no voice.\nThey call the roles “contract to hire,” but the moment they want to go lean, the contracts are the first to burn.\nYou do the same work, for less pay, with more fear, and they call it flexibility.\nIt’s not freedom. It’s precarity rebranded as choice.\n\nThe American system does not invest in me, my career, or my future.\nSo I have decided to invest the least I can back into it.\n\nYou take our labor and our loyalty but give us no security, no growth, no belonging.\nYou call us your employees and your consumers, yet you refuse to invest in either.\n\nSo I am done feeding the hand that bites.\nI am cutting my spending, cutting my effort, cutting my dreams down to survival mode as protest.\n\nI will no longer build your wealth at the cost of my peace.\nYou chose profit over people.\nNow people will choose withdrawal over participation.\n\nThis is not burnout. It is boycott.\nThis is not surrender. It is strategy.",

I have been working here for 6 months and my contract ends in november with the likely chance of getting it extended for 3 years (subject to funding). \n\nMy chronic pain is ever changing and is highly affected by winter, my own mental health, and affects my energy levels and sleep schedule massively. I also have other health issues such as thyroid issues and depression. \n\nMy manager knows about my chronic pain and accomodates for it already, but I am thinking of writing a document detailing how the pain causes fatigue, what my needs are and just for information that may help them understand how i will operate in the future. \n\nIn previous corporate jobs, I have always known to disclose as little as possible about my health and it has been helpful. \n\nNow, I know this may be a sin, but I am starting to trust my manager with the information. It will likely lead to even more flexibility, and everyone is disabled, so they to a degree understand my circumstances.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Do I wait for contract to renew?

      "selftext": "Hi, this title seems a bit clickbait but i's not totally.\n\nI won't reinvent the Marxism but basically, the coffee dispensers you have in your workplaces are means of production.\n\nSome investors have speculated that people in your workplace would want coffee, and would be ready to pay for that.\n\nSince they took the risk to invest huge amounts of money into building the dispenser, they're in a strong position to : sell you trash expensive coffee, and underpay the workers who will maintain and refill the dispenser.\n\nBasically, when someone pays a coffee via the dispenser, he will partly pay the \"plus-value\" of the dispenser owners, an amount of money that hasn't been generated by any work, to the detriment of coffee buyers and dispenser maintenance technicians.\n\nBut sometimes, even in the most corporate places, salarymen and salarywomen have found a way to bypass the necessity to buy stuff to the dispenser.\n\nThey have found a way to get coffee without paying the mean of production owner.\n\nThey collectively identified a common need amongs community memberes (\"drink coffee regularly\"), and they collectively created their own mean of production : they contributed equally to it, by contributed equally to buy their own coffee machine.\n\nEvery salary-paid coffee machines are collectivized means of production, producing coffee for all thanks to the contribution of all. At the end of the day, the workers who bought their own machines pay cheaper and better coffee. If we extrapolate this experiment in a way bigger company, then they could even pay for their own maintenace technician, but this technician would have a fair wage that does not finance a \"plus-value\" of any owner since it's a fait deal between consumers and producers.\n\n  \nThis process could be applied to any sort of collectivized production in 2025.\n\nIf 20-100 employees are frequently able to organize themselves to manage their own coffee production, then 200-1000, 2000-10 000, 20 000-100 000 people around the world could organize themselves to handle the production of anything ; they could invest in some bakery together, some farm, some gaming studio...\n\nThe principle would always be the same: instead of paying for a trash product that will pay for the mean of production + the owner income, pay for the mean of production directly and get the product to a very fair price and a very fair quality\n\n  \nAt this scale, workers would not be employed by the owner of the mean of production, but by the consumers of the products who will allow the production to not be pressured by a capitalist competition, revenues are guaranteed since the consumers are the ones who started the production. No marketing fee, no stock option payment, only true wealth in the pockets of consumers and workers.",

It is about keeping money moving.\n\nWhen people commute, they buy gas, grab coffee, eat lunch out, and spend more overall. That spending supports local businesses, boosts corporate profits, and increases tax revenue. When people stay home, all of that slows down and the economy feels it.\n\nThe phrase “better teamwork” is just a cover. The real goal is to restart the flow of spending. The system needs people on the road and in offices to keep money circulating.\n\nEven when entire teams are spread across different states and still meet through Microsoft Teams, companies continue to demand in-person attendance. Corporations do not care if workers quit over return to office. They will simply replace anyone who leaves. What matters is maintaining the cycle of spending that fuels the economy.\n\nIf management or government admitted this, people would push back. They would bring lunch from home, spend less, or refuse to commute. Instead, the message is wrapped in comforting words about collaboration and culture.\n\nReturn to office is not about teamwork. It is about economics and keeping the machine running.",

      "selftext": "I want to preface this by saying I’m autistic, and I’m just sick and tired of masking so hard to seem professional. It’s not that I’m even bad at school, school was never hard for me, I notice college is hard for me and I’m not EXACLTY sure what I want to do, currently I am saving up, to escape a bad home life situation. I promise I don’t share this to be “woe is me”, I’ve pretty much accepted my stakes in life. I think I’ve found some enjoyment at the end of the day, life is tough but I’m tougher, and I am determined to at least make a comfortable life for myself. \n\nAnd, I am, in a year from now I’m gonna move out, and rent with a friend, I’m also in a small place, and there’ll be more people my age around me, and god I’m just so excited, it’s given me something to hold on to. \n\nI started working fast food recently, 11 an hour, obviously not good, but I already have a sum of cash saved, and I don’t have to spend any of it so I save as much as I can, I should end up having a good chunk of cash saved. I was dreading this, because to be frank autism just makes shit hard, but I suck it up because I don’t wanna be on disability, and I try my best to not seem that way. But.. I’m starting to think I honestly don’t hate it, the work is meaningless and repetitive usually and I absolutely love that. \n\nLike, why the fuck would I take any pride in my job? I’m not doing anything important, and something about that makes the stakes low for me, my manager is also fine letting me wear my AirPods, I don’t wear them just to listen to music, it’s for the noise cancellation, loud noises can become too much for me, I didn’t say anything about it, just asked and it was fine. Overall, everyone seems chill with me, and will even strike conversations with me. \n\nI’ll be frank that I’ve been really isolated, I am still not really comfortable around them, and obviously I am *not* expecting them to be my best buddies in the world, I am mostly off to myself and listening to music. I also like it cus i mostly do a night shift, and it’s relatively peaceful, i also no longer have to fight my tendency to fight when my body wants to naturally sleep. \n\nI want to say, I’m glad they either don’t find me Odd and Unlikeable, or if they do they don’t seem to care, I almost feel this sense of relief, because yknow it’s fast food, they’d want me to work here the rest of my life they could get away with it. I’m not trying to act like it’s sunshine and rainbows, but I feel sad because there’s not like a lot else I could do, where I’m allowed to just do my work, maybe chat if I’m comfortable, and not have to pretend I am the Most Likeable Extrovert To Ever Be Perfect. \n\nEven as a kid, I knew I didn’t really want to work, or at the very least it didn’t mean anything, I shouldn’t value it anymore except as a necessity to live. I would tell people I’d like to be a garbageman, mailman, or a plumber, but they’d just laugh and tell me I’m too smart and gifted for that.. even as a kid I found the concept of “being gifted” to be extremely lame and just not true. I could just read at a college level as a kid, nothing to slap our knees and lose our shit over, I don’t see the job opportunities that should’ve apparently came my way. \n\nI would still absolutely be a garbage man or a mailman today, but it’s embarrassing.. I cannot drive. I am not scared or anything, it’s just that I need a lot of practice, and I promise I’m not just groveling in laziness or self pity, but there’s genuinely no way to get my license unless if I purchase private lessons. I will be in a more walkable area, i genuinely want to drive really badly, I will try to figure out something, because I know I have to learn to drive, there’s no ifs or buts about it. I just feel sad sometimes, because there’s jobs cut off that I’d love to do, but understandably of course they want someone who wouldn’t be a liability on the road. \n\nI spoke quite positively about work here, so maybe this doesn’t fit here. I guess I’m just sad in a way that I am not in fact “smart” enough for a “fancy” career, not even because I don’t have the skills, but I just cannot mask enough to not seem autistic. It’s just enough I can live a relatively normal life and am expected too, but just enough I end up giving some folks uncanny valley effects.. I used to be in a medical program, but I was tight fit and small, the people in there just acted like glorified highschoolers, and seemed to have an issue with me, at the end of the day it just wasn’t for me, but I do feel like I’m in some fucked up limbo sometimes, just enough but not close enough. I would never survive office politics, it probably wouldn’t even take a few months before they find someone more interesting and likable than me.\n\nI think I am ok, and will fight this last stretch to finally have a somewhat peaceful home life with my teeth if I have to. But it just feels so fucked because yes, I can work, but any job I do get, there will always be a timer, waiting to replace me, except at fast food because they don’t have the means to be getting away with getting rid of someone just cus they don’t care about gossip.. if I am ‘smarter’ than I don’t see it, I am currently in a college semester right now, but i genuinely don’t know what degree to get, and I had enough from a grant I could go to community college for free, so I think after I finish this, I’m just gonna keep working for awhile. I am also just sick of school, and think I just need a break ( from school, I’m still going to be working, or getting online certifications. ) I am NOT saying I’m gonna work fast food for the rest of my life, but it’s just that it’s kinda easy enough for me right now, and I can save up cash. So even though, yes, I obviously could not live off this, I can at least have a good chunk of cash saved before I have to start paying rent.

      "title": "Why does management always expect big results without giving you the tools necessary or true authority?",
      "selftext": "I’m a lead for a department and I don’t understand what upper management actually expects from people sometimes.\n\nIf I’m in charge of a department, I can lead, delegate, and try to keep things running smoothly but I’m not given the authority or resources to actually enforce anything. I can’t hire, I can’t fire, and we’re constantly short staffed. Yet somehow the expectation is that everything still gets done like we’re fully staffed with a high-performing team.\n\nHere’s an example: let’s say we have six tasks that need to be done right now.\n\nI assign one employee tasks 1, 2, and 3, and I take 4, 5, and 6 myself.\n\nBy the time I finish my half, they’re still on task 1 because they are milking it. So I end up doing 2 and 3 just to make sure the work gets done on time. Meanwhile, I can’t move on to the next round of tasks because I’m constantly cleaning up what others didn’t finish.\n\nAnd that’s the real problem is the team I’m given and working with. We’re already short staffed, but even within the small crew we have, only one other person besides me is actually solid. The rest are either really slow, take extra long breaks, or disappear half the shift (Hiding in the bathroom or glued to their phones.) On a typical 8 hour shift, they’re maybe doing 3-4 hours of real work. So when management asks why things aren’t getting done, it’s because I’m effectively running a department with one reliable person and a few ghosts.\n\nWhat’s frustrating is that these people are still getting paid for all that wasted time, while I’m the one picking up their slack to make sure everything gets finished. Sometimes I honestly think: why even have them here? If they’re only working a fraction of the time, I’d rather just have fewer people and get compensated more myself, since I’m the one doing their share anyway.\n\nI get that a part timer making $15 an hour isn’t going to move with the same urgency as a full timer or someone like me in a lead role. But there’s a difference between “acting your wage” and just being an asshole. I’m not some boomer preaching the “no one wants to work” line, I’m 29 and I’m just tired of working with people who drag everyone else down. Especially when it’s people older than me. It makes me cringe when I have to tell like a 37 year old man what to do and they do these things. It’s like dude I’m nearly a decade younger than you why are you acting like this? Lol \n\nOverall though I blame upper management for not staffing properly and for setting unrealistic expectations.\n\nThey expect “manager-level” results from people with zero real authority, minimal staff, and no incentive structure that motivates anyone to care. You can’t demand top tier productivity from a skeleton crew and then act shocked when things fall behind.\n\nI’m just tired of having such high expectations but with limited resources. I mean there’s only so much I can physically do. They must realize that? They’re not stupid and know we’re short staffed (On purpose to save in payroll) so how can they really expect things to look 100%?\n\nWhat made me think of this is I was running around all day just for my boss to look at the department and say “it looks like shit” and start asking me why these things aren’t done, despite the fact that it would of looked much worse if I wasn’t doing 75% of the work. It just sucks because I’m new to being a boss and I feel like I’m failing. \n\nIdk do you got any advice for me? Haha ",

      "selftext": "LET'S GO BITCHES!!!  \n\nIf you're here, you already know why I was let go and why I had to delete.  \nIf you don't, I'm sure someone will be kind enough to explain it to you in the comments.  \nSide note, if you're trying to guess where I worked or who I am, just don't. It doesn't make you look smart or clever.  \nIt's a violation of privacy and it makes you look like an ass.  \nIt's part of the first post problem.  \nI'm doing this to help people.  \n\nNow to the good shit I'm sure y'all have been waiting for...plus extra from questions I got in the comments. \n\n\n1. Talk to your hospitals about payment plans and any discounts they may have to offer you first. I had a $20,000 bill go down to a $200 bill. Results will vary, but please go this route first. You'll have to fill out paperwork. It's a hassle. It'll help you in the long run.  \n\n2.  Debt collectors cannot garnish you if you are current on child support...plus you owe it to your kids. Pay your damn child support.  \n\n3.  Once a bank garnishment is in place, there is no stopping it. There is no setting up a payment plan until the debt collection company knows how much money  the bank turned over to the courts.  \n\n4.  One a employment garnishment is in place, they are usually locked in until the debt is paid in full.  \n\n5. Hear me when I say information you give is *voluntary*\n\n6. Debt collectors *have* to follow federal laws. There is one written specifically for them called the FDCPA or the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.  \n\n7. If you are retired, if you are on SSI, or disability, you need to be honest about that shit. That money is not collectable.  \n\n8. If you are on a bank account, that bank account can be garnished. It doesn't matter if it was joint with your spouse or if you opened it for your kid.  \n*YOU* were on it.  \n\n9. Not all services are covered under one bill. You might get a hospital bill and think that's it. Anesthesia, radiology, and ambulance bills are different bills.  \n\n*I did see in the comments where that is not the case for public hospitals and that all services are included in bills there. However, most hospitals are privatized so please be aware that there is the possibility of MORE than one bill. \n\n10. May I suggest Discover? Especially for the nervous Nellie's who just will spill\neverything \n\n11. Debt collectors call blocked because once upon a time someone was embarrassed that a debt collector was calling them. So now debt collectors have to ask for permission to call unblocked.  \n\n12. The reason debt collectors ask you to verify with name or address is because they are dealing with medical data. It's protected by HIPAA. Playing 20 questions won't get anyone anywhere.  It just makes shit weird. You can ask for the company name, phone number, and ask to call back. They should have no problem with this.  \n\n13. If you're getting garned, I know you're pissed. I've been there. I've been dual garned. I had my paycheck garnished and my bank account wiped out. Do not scream at the person on the other end of the phone. I made $17.00/hr...and hear me out, you might get one of the good ones like me.  \nIf you had a judgement out, you were making payments to the court, a debt collection company missed that, and garned your bank by accident, what do you think will help you more?  \nI've also seen debt collectors work two hours on an account pulling an unfair garnishment.  \n\n14.  See if you can set up a settlement in full agreement. Depending on the state and who the debt is with the settlement is usually about 75%-ish and must be paid in full.  \n\n15.  Just because you say \"stop calling me,\" and the calls stop?  \nIt doesn't mean the collection process stops. \nBut it also means you get 0 garnishment warnings. \n\n16. Once you say you have an attorney, we can't talk to you anymore. Your people have to talk to our people.  \n\n17.  A judgement does not fall off after 7 years. That's bullshit. Once  a judge signs that paperwork, that is him or her agreeing the debt collection company has the right to collect that money. \nThe evidence has been presented and the judge agreed it was legal. I have seen cases from 2009.  \nLegal accounts collect interest, it doesn't matter if they're medical or not.  \n\n18. On your intake, on the insurance page, when it says you agree to pay all costs that insurance does not pay, that is you agreeing to pay the debt. I do not care what the man on social media said. He's wrong. I'm right. He's trying to sell you a course. I'm posting this shit on Reddit for fucks sakes. For free.  \n\n19. If you are 18, you are responsible for your own debt in all states except for one and that's the state of Nebraska where it's 19.  \n\n20. Wages can be garnished 15% to 25% of your take home pay. It depends on the company.  \n\n21.  Bank garnishments can take everything up to the full dollar amount. If the debt is $675 and you have $700 in your account, they can take everything.  \nIt doesn't matter if you have rent or your mortgage due. It doesn't matter if you need to buy groceries this week. *It does not matter*  \n\n22. Divorce decrees do not matter to debt collectors. If your names are both on the title and your ex drops the ball on payments? If your job or bank gets found first?It's all on you, babes.  \nRefinance. Refinance. *REFINANCE*  \n\n23. Colleges will usually go one of 3 ways. They will either be non-legal, which means that they won't go to court no matter what, you just can't enroll in any other classes til your bill gets paid. They will go legal, in which case, follow the steps above. OR it's through the government and Jerome Powell recently said those loans would never be forgiven and the Federal Reserve is privately-owned. If that is the case, Godspeed.  \n\n24. If you can *safely* drive the injured person to the hospital?\nDo that. \nIf you can't?  \nDon't do that.  \n\n25. If you file bankruptcy, everything prior to that file date is gone. Everything after it, especially if it was a chapter 13, is still there waiting to be collected on. \n\n26. *see 25, So if you're going to file medical bankruptcy, make sure that it is an amount that you absolutely cannot get out of.  \n\n\n\n\nI hope these tips help y'all.  \n  \n",

      "title": "I quit my abusive job, without a backup",
      "selftext": "So as the title says, I was working a job that sucked, they lied to me about raises and promotions, over worked me, punished me for others mistakes, and much more. One day I had enough, no watershed moment no final straw, I just came into work looked at my tools looked at my boss talking to people across the shop and said, \"you know what, I don't want to do this anymore\". So I packed my tool boxes and personal items up, and just pushed them out to my truck, I loaded everything in, walked back inside and told my coworker-friends and some of the foreman what was up and just left. \n\nI had no prospects for a new job, my wife is a SAHM and we have a 1 year old, a dog and a mortgage that was barely covered by my paycheck each month.(We are in about 18k of debt because of it, just to eat and buy gas) Even with all those drawbacks I'm so glad I left.\n\nSo here's the reason why, I had been hired as a level 1 mechanic, my manager who was also the one who hired me said during the hiring process \"wow you have more than enough experience to be hired at level 2 (5-10$ more an hour)but I just filled out last level 2 spot, so you'll have to start at level 1, but in 3 months it's preformance review time, and I will definitely move you up to level 2 then.\"\nIn 2½ years I was never promoted,( but they hired 5 people in that time, people with less experience and qualifications at level 2 one even at level 3) even though they had me performing the duties of a level 3 mechanic. Eventually I asked if there was any department that was hiring with better pay I could transfer to, they said that since I had welding experience and helped assist the welder a bunch already that they would transfer me there and I'd get a significant raise and they would have an instructor certify me for welding.\nWell instead of a transfer they declared me a \" dual department employee \" gave me no raise, and had me doing welding repairs that I was capable of but entirely uncertified to do.\n So after 6 months of me welding AND maintaining the equipment, I had the audacity to ask, when was i going to be certified to do what Ive been doing,  I was told \"yeah... Sorry, we looked into it and it's just too much of a hassle and too expensive to have a welding instructor come give you a certification test, were just gonna have you move back to being a full time mechanic, and we are going to higher a second welder who is already certified\"\nTo which I replied, \"oh ok... So does that mean I will be promoted to level 2 finally?\"\nAnd he said\n\"Well that's gonna be hard since you haven't been doing as much mechanic work lately\"\nI was dumbstruck, I stood with my mouth open for about 5 seconds, looked him dead on his eyes and said \"bet\" turned around and walked away, for the next few months I did as little as possible, until I was just bored and couldn't bring myself to try at all.\n\nIn almost 3 years I had only gotten a 0.9% wage increase, that when I received it they called a \"merit increase\" I asked if they knew what message they were sending by saying \"I only merit a few cent raise\"\nThey explained that really it was a cost of living increase but they just couldn't call it that. (And yeah you can't call a raise a cost of living increase when it's less than inflation that year).\n\nSo when I quit it was a bit spur of the moment, but a long time coming. I had asked my wife if it was ok to quit at some point soon and she was behind me 110%, I had looked for jobs before but hadn't gotten any bites by the time I quit.\n\nNow it's been almost 2 months of being unemployed and burning away all our savings and maxing out our credit to stay afloat, and we are still happy that I did it. I've gotten through a few interviews (about 15)and I have some job offers now, all much higher paying and better benefits. Hopefully I accept the right one and don't wind up back at the same kind of job.\n\nI know why people don't do it this way, if any one stroke of luck we had didn't happen we would be fuched and on the street, but regardless I'm glad I just said fuck this job, and left.",

The idea that a medical issue could wipe out everything I've worked for is deeply unsettling. And I’ve felt this way since my 20s. I’d gladly pay my share, even if I don’t need it in the near-term. \n\nPolitics aside—because I'm so exhausted by the political noise from both sides—I'm trying to understand why we, as a country, wouldn’t want something like this for ourselves. \nUniversal healthcare seems like it would be one of the most important things we could do to protect our well-being and financial security.\n\nThis isn’t meant to be a political post.

She changes the schedule so last minute that I came into work one morning two hours late because she changed my schedule last minute, and she’s done this with a bunch of people. It seems like something she does on the regular. So she can change my schedule last minute, not tell me, then give me no call no shows. She told me if I get more I’ll lose my job. no not her exact words but yes that is the gist of what she was saying. \n\nOne of my supervisors was trying to get the no call no shows taken off but A was really fighting her on it. I also told A when she changed my schedule a couple weeks ago that I can’t do any last minute changes and she has to stop changing my schedule around. She was arguing with me on it and not hearing me at all. I’ve been telling my other supervisor about this and A used to do this to him as well. He told me that A’s supervisor has been trying to get her fired; not sure how true that is. He suggested that I email A’s supervisor reporting her so I did. This is the most recent update. I don’t go to work for a couple more days but hopefully A’s supervisor read my email and does something about it. \n\nI’m starting to get convinced that A wants me fired.

Unless youve signed some kind of contract with them saying otherwise, you don't HAVE to tell them why. They have no right to your Personal Health Information, or anything you wish to remain private. Good employers have various types of leave available for you like jury duty, sick, vacation, bereavement, but any modern, respectful employer does not need you to prove it. It's pretty gross to ask an employee to prove their family member died, which btw requires a copy of a death certificate which isn't a quick process. I think for Jury Duty you might need to prove it, but even so,... \n\nIn general, don't tell them why, and don't ASK. You're telling them: \"I have to take off today\".\n\nI started doing this merely to avoid making up lies that I'd have to keep track of, like being sick with a fake illness.

It takes much longer to get food out. The biggest issue is meat since it takes 90 seconds to cook sausage and since we have 1 meat grill it takes 3 runs to make a single tray. We also have bacon and steak  that use the same grill and during a rush we always run out of all 3 since we can only cook one at a time.\n\nThe grill team has been yelled at for taking too long on orders and never having enough food in the cabinets when they know we only have 2 grills. Its complete bullshit and theres nothing I can do.",

      "selftext": "Supervisor sent a message to the 3 of us to join a call. I know he drinks the cool aid, but he does care, so don’t hate on him. Saw another post about this a year ago, it’s the higher ups. It’s not his boss. And it’s not even his boss’ boss. Whoever it is, they can’t fathom that remote workers offer them anything of value. \n\nWhen I was hired in May 2021 after graduating from college, it was a fully remote role. Still, I relocated to the city they had a site in. They had “back to site Wednesday’s” once Covid calmed down in Spring 2022. But in Spring 2023, my wife and I relocated to a different city, 2 hours from that site. So when they announced the “back to work initiative” where you had to come in 3 days a week, there was a backlash naturally, but I got to remain remote. Then comes Spring 2024. Back to site 5 days a week. Still exempt. And now here we are. \n\nA bit of backtracking, I started out in customer service, then moved into data analytics a little over a year in, but it wasn’t a promotion. We had the same damn job titles and the same damn pay despite our job description changing pretty much every 6 months and adding new and more duties. Finally the promotion comes in, but I don’t qualify because they simply won’t approve promotions for anyone who isn’t onsite full time. \n\nMy favorite part is that there was no offer to relocate in order to get the promotion. All he said was if we did relocate, he would resubmit, but couldn’t guarantee a timeline or even approval. I could relocate and not get a raise for another 3 years, or not at all. \n\nThree of the team’s top performers in a call being told they aren’t worth anything to the company. Had half the mind to just quit on the spot, but I’ll be looking for a job before I leave. The sad part is I’d like to change career fields, so if I do leave, I’ll most likely take a pay cut at first. It’ll be for the better though. \n\nAnd that’s the other thing. I’m not against in person work, I’ve been traveling to the other city once a month for 3 days, staying with family, and going onsite to spend time with coworkers. That was my choice, not required as a remote employee. But I wanted to. So I’d love to go onsite, but not 2 hours away :/ and not asking my wife to quit her job that she loves and makes double what I do. Anyway. Ramble over. Eff corporate America. \n\nTLDR: Raise promised for over 3 years goes to everyone except for the 3 remote workers on the team. Hired into a fully remote listed position, constant job duty increases, punished for relocating for wife’s new in person job before back to site initiatives even began. ",

      "selftext": "I currently work in a visa office (UK) and we're quite short staffed. On Tuesday and Wednesday evening this week, there was a really high volume of applicants and some of us ended up finishing later than scheduled. Our supervisor/shift manager said we wouldn't be paid overtime but we could have the time back. However, she has a habit of trying to guilt people about that, and this occasion was no exception. A colleague advised us to put it in writing with the office manager/overall boss copied in, or Supervisor will pretend she never said that.\n\nI emailed her a list of us who ended up staying past our finish time and how long by. I also said we appreciate it might not be possible to return it to everyone at the same time, so we're happy for her to check our individual rotas and decide who can have a late start, early finish or have it added to their break. She came up to me while I was in the middle of dealing with a customer and started having a go: \"You lot get to leave on time most evenings, why can't you do this one favour?\" I told her I'd discuss it after I'd served my customer, and she backed off.\n\nWhen we resumed the conversation, she asked when I'd like my 10 minutes, and I said I didn't mind as long as it's in the next two weeks, as my last day is on the 24th. She said \"OK, you can finish early on your last day then. But I still don't think 10 minutes is too much to ask!\" I pointed out she wouldn't say that if we were 10 minutes late, and she got nasty, saying \"Newdate, I don't mind you claiming the time back, but the way you asked was not nice!\" Awww, did I hurt the poor wickle supervisor's feelings then?🙄\n\nAccording to colleagues, she's had multiple complaints about her for bullying behaviour - she won't take you into the office to discuss issues or misunderstandings, she'll shout at you in front of everyone, which is really unprofessional. She's on her final warning apparently, so she was probably annoyed at being made to look bad in front of the big boss. Anyway, me and the other agency workers have just put the overrun time on our timesheets so the agency can pay us. Two more weeks and I'll never have to see her again! Roll on 24th.",

      "selftext": "I spent the last nine years working for this company surviving multiple layoffs. I was recently on a team that was disbanded and started training on a new one. However in the time between the old team ending and the new one starting I happened to find a new role with a different company that is not only fully remote but pays considerably better. \n\nNew company went out of their way to accommodate me so I could give my two weeks notice and make the transition as smooth as possible. \n\nSo I do the right thing and tell my trainer/manager that I found a new job and give my two weeks notice. Mostly so that if the new gig doesn't work out I can go back and still be considered rehireable. \n\nHowever, because I was in training for the old company as soon as I told them I was moving on they told me that I wasn't going to get paid for the two weeks, but my manager said I would be paid out my accrued PTO. It's not a full two weeks but it's better than nothing. It was my mistake not to get this in writing...\n\nNow I'm reaching out to payroll to find out when I'm getting my last check and they're telling me that they don't pay out PTO and I'll just be getting paid for the two days I worked before putting in my 2WN. \n\nI live in a red state and state law doesn't require them to pay out PTO. As of right now I'm fucked out of two weeks of pay and left with a sour taste in my mouth from a company that I honestly believed was better than this.\n\nTL;DR: Didn't get promise of last paycheck in writing, getting fucked by company on my way out the door. \n",

I’m currently working a traditional 9/5 and this is garbage. I’m never going to like it but I kinda enslaved myself with rent and car payment. \n\nNEET is quite lonely and gets very boring. Part-Time work is the sweet spot. I called my dad and told him I regret moving out and deciding to be an “adult”. Told me I can come back when my lease ends and it sounds very tempting ever since Ive had a big boy job. Working full time makes me feel like work occupies my entire life. I genuinely don’t see how anybody can be happy in life working traditional hours. The lack of time makes me feel like I have limited control over my life. ",

My students are in 6th grade and it’s a very tough class with its own challenges. My friend also works with 6th graders so we have a lot to relate to and share when it comes to these kids. We’re actually both teacher’s assistants. \n\nI noticed my friend always craves chaos and she’s always complaining about something. She never seems to have anything positive to say. Someone or something is always an issue and she paints herself out to be the victim.\n\nToday, after the kids went home she came into my classroom all excited telling me and the other teacher that one of our students was bullying another boy. But before all of that she demanded to speak to our head teacher in the classroom. In our classroom it’s 2 teachers and 2 (including me) teacher’s assistants. One teacher is very new and our other teacher is the head teacher like she’s been here the longest. When she demanded to speak to that teacher I told her that she wasn’t in the room and to tell me and the other teacher. She was talking very loudly about how our students were bullying another student. The new teacher said that’s not okay and we’re going to handle it. \n\nMy friend then texted me that she emailed our principal and someone from admin about what happened because “it didn’t sit right” with her. I said to her “oh I wish you let us handle this before going to admin” like the main teacher didn’t even know about what happened and my friend went over our heads. Then my friend told me that I’m making this into a problem because of me wanting the head teacher to know. I told her that it’s only right that the teacher needs to know before this goes over her and she not even having a clue. She also said that the teacher in my classroom needs to not be so stuck on wanting control. She kept insisting that she can’t have this getting back to her and being a reflection on her.\n\nIt’s also worth noticing that her class has serve bullying like physical fights. My class isn’t that great either but they aren’t physical and when they are mean to each other we don’t let it slide. I’m so disappointed like I wouldn’t do this to her and go over her head to admin if one of her students did this. I would calmly tell her and her work team without raising my voice and making a scene. We also have work observations coming up that include a raise and bonus on our job performance. This doesn’t look good and might hurt my performance and the teachers I work with. ",

      "selftext": "The way some folk hold up the idea of \"work ethic\" as if lack of it is indicative of laziness or as if laziness is inherently immoral in some way. \n\nThe term was pushed by protestants in the 16th century, any self proclaimed atheist who believes in \"work ethic\" is a fucking chump. And its all verifiable history. \n\nWhen capitalism rose up it kept the moral logic but ditched the religious shit. Industrial capitalism weaponised it to justify exploitation all this \"if you're poor its your fault, you don't work hard enough\" and \"pull yourself up by your bootstraps\" bullshit. That protestant work ethic evolved into today's cult of productivity. Societies where you're expected to be constantly fucking doing things. \n\nSo now the \"lazy\" person becomes a convenient villain in a story where work = worth, ergo anyone who refuses to sell their labor for survival or who prioritises doing what they enjoy is somehow defective. Even a lot of folk who theoretically reject capitalism (or claim to), still feel guilty when they spend a day lazing around the house doing nothing and just resting and chilling. As if they owe productivity to the cosmos. \n\nAll for what? \"work ethic\" didnt come from some deep human truth. It came from the Church. When will folk stop believing the lie that their worth depends on how productive they are? \n\n\"work ethic\" is an oxymoron ",

I thought I’d secure another part time role within a few weeks. I was wrong. \n\nI’ve compiled a list of all the positions I’ve applied to in this time frame and have eclipsed nearly 40 which I guess doesn’t sound like too much but when you have to repeatedly provide a resume then answer follow up questions on the application before you submit it; and each application looks a little different with its own criteria to be met it’s annoying. I’ve done around 10 phone interviews and 7 in person. \n\nIt gets really old having to provide scenarios to the same questions like “what was a time you had to do X, and how you do X and what was the result of X” and the constant regurgitating of questions alike. I try really hard to provide true examples and not just make things up. I answer all the questions directly and swiftly. I express how I genuinely would enjoy the nature of the work I applied for. I have experience in all the positions I’ve applied to. I dress up in professional attire, even been complimented on my appearance. I’ve been told the interview went great a few times. \n\nI even told one person I was at my son’s school event but still was willing to step away and talk about the position, to which she replied thank you I understand how important that is. Just for her to ghost me after saying she’d call back to set up an in person interview. Even called her back and left a follow up voicemail. Still nothing. \n\nOnly time you are told you didn’t get selected was through an AI generated email or through the job board app you used. No one calls to notify you. I lost count how many times I was told I’ll pass along your info to the location manager and they’ll reach out if they want to. \n\nI need the money and obviously have no choice but to keep applying but it’s draining and all feels fake. It all feels forced. I had genuine enthusiasm now I just feel down and like I’m wasting my time, gas, or mental entertaining all of it. \n\nJust a rant. Hope I can come back to this with better news soon. ",

I’m just telling you where I’m at and my brain is in a foggy soup like slurry.\n\nPayday was today so I was able to take a negligible chunk out of some of my debt. At this point that is my only motivation. The day when I can finally see “Paid in Full!” on my next Mohela email. \n\nThat and not wanting to be homeless of course.\n\nI like my job, I really do. After 20 years of retail this is a godsend. But each time there’s no one to cover night shift and I have back to back shifts, I can’t ignore the extra hours. \n\nIs 42 really that early of a grave?",

First day of work, they tell me that since they’re so busy, everyone is required to do 60 hours, 10 hrs a day, 6 days a week. They refuse to give anyone a date on when it’s going back to normal hours. I’m only on day 3 and i already want to quit. It’s so strict, you’re not allowed to have your phone, you can’t choose when you take your 30 minute unpaid lunch, and today they said we’re not allowed to talk to coworkers anymore, and they’ll start firing people for it. Every single one of my coworkers says they hate it. apparently they time your bathroom break as well with some sort of sensor with your keycard. The work itself is really easy and I don’t mind the actual work, however i don’t enjoy working there due to the conditions and how everyone there hates it, and hates the management. what should i do? is there any advice someone can give me on how to make the time go faster, or should I just leave? I don’t want to be dramatic since I literally just got there. I just think it’s weird how 90% of the workers just got there within the last two months.",

      "selftext": "For context, I was hired in late July of this year to work under the executive director(who was hired in June of this year) of a museum as a museum program director. Our dynamic was great until September and she began to quite literally lose her shit about any minor inconvenience, forget daily events even though we constantly talk about them and she has access to a shared google calendar, and constantly change her mind about how she wanted something done after a task was completed with her initial instructions. To me, it seems like this woman who looks to be in her late 60s is showing signs of dementia or she’s just a bitch and she can’t hide it anymore.\nI’m beyond tired of dealing with her tantrums but today took the cake; my coworker who has the same title as me but works in a different department and I decided that we would let each other know if the Executive Director was mad at the other so we wouldn’t continue to be blindsided, so I let this coworker know that the Exec D thinks her not getting a task done before leaving the other day was “bullshit”. My coworker has a very short fuse and decided to confront her using the term “bullshit”. It didn’t bother me (I was aware that would make it obvious that I spoke to her about it) because I thought this would be the perfect opportunity to start a conversation that nobody wanted to start.\nInstead of taking accountability for what she said and apologizing, the Exec D told my coworker that was a test to see if I would partake in gossip so she could get a better judgment of my character. My coworker was not manipulated by this and we are still a united front in trying to both survive her and get rid of her, but now there is a smear campaign being waged against me to the owner of the museum, and I’m not really sure where to go from here.\nI did have my own personal talk with the exec director after the incident and she also did not admit responsibility for her part in this mess and told me that her feelings were hurt that I would “throw her under the bus”. I was basically strong armed into apologizing in the situation because she could not listen to anything I had to say about why we felt it was necessary to “gossip” and instead focused on me being a potential problem in the future. Any advice? (I already spoke to the owner and she wants to remain neutral but did suggest documenting EVERY conversation between us)",

      "selftext": "I’ve been working at a busy food service establishment for 10 years now, and as a supervisor there for most of that time. One of my co-supervisors (he’s been out of college for a year and a half now) has been off the rails recently. “Joking” with other employees (who are in high school, mind you) threatening to beat them up if they say something sarcastic or silly, telling them he’ll make sure our general manager doesn’t let them come back next season (it’s a seasonal job), etc. He’s a frat bro that is trying to bring his prior hazing into our workplace.\n\nFive days ago, he makes a comment under his breath (that only I heard) that he’s going to get a certain disease that is negatively stereotyped/associated against gay people if one of our other co-workers plays Manchild by Sabrina Carpenter on our share music speaker (the irony…). I was so shocked he said that that I didn’t know what to say or to call him out because part of me in the moment slightly doubted that he said that, but in hindsight, he absolutely did say that. (For additional context, his older brother is also gay…)\n\nLater that same shift (which I was the shift supervisor for), he SCREAMS at me at the top of his lungs across the building (and customers definitely heard him) about something insignificant but he just wanted to assert his authority over me and couldn’t manage to approach me face to face and ask me it like an adult. Meanwhile, our general manager was in the building when he screamed at me and she didn’t say a word to him about how unprofessional he was being.\n\nI was so taken aback by his screeching, I’ve decided I’m not even going to engage with him at all going forward unless it’s strictly necessary for work-related tasks. \n\nAnyway, so I then pulled our general manager aside in private and told her all of these things and how unacceptable the other supervisor’s behavior is and she only seemed slightly concerned about the intimidating the high schoolers part. She said she’ll talk to the supervisor ASAP about his behavior, BUT IT’S BEEN 5 DAYS AND NOTHING. We have had multiple shifts where all three of us were present and I know for certain he has not been spoken to yet. \n\nIt’s so frustrating because I know my manager views this supervisor as her favorite and she just needs to get over that or else she risks losing good employees (me and others) or even opens herself up to a lawsuit if the one of the high schoolers’ parents find out and take legal action.\n\nAm I overreacting?",

When he got promoted, he got lazy and sloppy and now does just the bare minimum. \n\nDavid and I both applied and got selected to interview for the position, but ultimately he was chosen. I was happy for him. He’s been with the company for 10 years; I knew I didn’t have a chance if he went out for it. \n\nAt the close of the conversation about me not getting selected, Jamie made the comment “Stella, I don’t want this to discourage you from applying for leadership positions in the future! I think you’re a wonderful addition to the team and you have a very bright future with our company. I’m sure that by the time David is ready to move on, you’ll be ready to take his place.”\n\nThat was well over a year ago. Since then, I’ve taken on *several* extra projects (including creating training videos for new hires, revamping our inventory process, joined some committee meetings, etc.), done lots of networking, picked up shifts when others called out.\n\nI should mention that I was also still in college when I took this position, but my degree is not the line of work I’m in. I ultimately decided to stay on and work towards this promotion, even after I finished my degree, feeling like I finally found my people.\n\nI’ve poured every ounce of my extra time and energy into doing the absolute best in my own role, and trying to prove that I could do more. and that I would definitely be ready to take on the assistant supervisor role.\n\nCut to this month. One of my colleagues has been acting strange, Susan. Out of the blue we have an email congratulating her on outstanding work ethic. Then she sends a group chat reminding the whole team of a deadline. And I’m just kinda scratching my head.\n\nCut to this morning. There’s a small PR event. Who’s invited to represent us? Jamie. David. And SUSAN.\n\nThen…. It hits me. They’re priming her for leadership. *Susan* will be stepping into David’s role. Comments and emails are falling into line in my head.\n\nI’m gutted. I’ve been taking on all this extra work. Some of it I’ve sought, but a lot of it has been assigned or asked of me. I’ve never felt such a force of betrayal. It feels like a living thing boiling under my skin.\n\nI put in a transfer request to another department and it was approved by HR. But they won’t be able to make the shift for at least another 2 months.\n\nHow do I work with these people for the next 2 months? How do I look them in the face and smile, when I’ve been played? They’ve taken the fact that I’m eager to move up, and eager to prove myself, and used that to get numerous projects taken care of “for free.” And I’ve been doing all of this thinking I’m next in line. Having been told I’m next in line. Just for them to pull the rug out from under me. Taken advantage of. I feel like such a naive fool.\n\nPart of me really wants to just abandon the company altogether. But they’re the highest paying in my field. I would most certainly take a pay cut if I left them instead of sticking it out until the transfer.\n\nTL;DR- Job promised me a promotion, I’ve been killing myself to prove I’m worth it, for them to offer it to someone else with less experience. I can’t leave, and my transfer request is going to take a couple months. Idk how to force myself to keep going to work.\n\nAdvice. Stories. Open to anything you wanna hit me with. Doubt I could feel much lower.",

This will very likely remain as my routine once I finally have a \"real\" job outside school.\n\nWhat is the damn point of having a home if you spend 2/3 of your time away? Might as well live at the office and save the commute time.\n\nPlease note that I said that this schedule has me grinding 3 days a week, so I'm not working literally 24/7.

We accrue vacation time faster than most other agencies and generally speaking, but in my division in particular, we are very low micromanaging and heavy on balance, even if there’s more work than time. \n\nI was promoted into a brand new role about a year and a half ago and we have been evolving the role as we figure out how it really fits into our agency processes. We hired a counterpart to my position a few months ago and went with someone who was an intern at our agency. We have similar day to day duties, but I am a title spot higher and act as a mentor (not his supervisor) and work on some bigger projects. He’s been great, but since we hired him, one thing we keep on him about is that nothing we do is life and death, so clock out at the end of the day and forget about things until the morning. It’s not uncommon for him to say, “I plan on working on that this weekend” in passing and we always tell him he doesn’t need to do that, it can wait til Monday.\n\nSo yesterday, right before the end of the day, he calls me on Teams. Asks a question and we work through it in a couple minutes. As were signing odd. He says, “Thanks. I’ll go ahead and let … I’ll do this as my first task in the morning.” I told him to have a good night and logged out. Messaged my boss and told her about his mid sentence shift and we digital high fived over the small progress. \n\nThere’s multiple reasons I see. Part of it is his personality, part is cultural, part is being fresh out of college and into the workforce. But we’re breaking the free labor habit bit by bit. Next step is to get him to join my push for a 4 day, 32 hour work week. (We have to be at 32 to be considered full time per statute.)\n",

I think one of the inherent problems is the #1 mentality of the USA, with those in power trying to make metrics like GDP a competition. Instead of caring about 'total output' we should care about metrics like 'median well-being' - which should be defined by three or four core tenets: healthcare, housing, education, leisure\\*. We should strive to make all of these available to everyone and of the highest possible quality. \\*Leisure would be measured at least by the amount of hours in the work week across all industries. A 32 hour work week with no loss in pay would be a substantial improvement in life for many. Working less hours should be patriotic, and working more hours should be a hobby.",

I am a PA by trade and I wrote on a script pad the following. \"I'm an adult.\" After tossing it on his desk it didn't seem to make anyone happy and I didn't give a shit. I guess they were right. I have a bad attitude. Unfortunately it's because I won't allow you to treat me like a child and I certainly don't owe you anything. ",

Mind you I'm the best performer in the team but since they didn't want to promote me, I started doing the bare minimum, but still meeting every metrics to the tee.\n\nThen HR started bullying me when I stated the reason for the supposed \"Lack of performance\". She said she is here to enforce the rules and that I should abide to whatever my manager outlines in the PIP document. She also said that I would need to come to the office and I refused flat out because my father is very ill. She went on a rant about her also needing to abide by every rule she outlines, which is not true because she has an affair with one of my teammates, which is clearly unacceptable in the employee policy. She doesn't know that I know. Then she said there would be repercussions if I don't abide to these imposed rules which includes coming back to the office (In our jurisdiction, and labor laws you cannot fire someone based on alleged poor performance or family responsibilities). This is literally unfair treatment because everybody else is underperforming. HR literally threatened me and dared me to disobey to discover the repercussions. \n\nNow, what would you advise me, in terms of next steps. I documented every interaction, whether teams, emails, calls, recording meetings etc. Should I take this to employee relations? Or consult a lawyer or labor standards office?",

      "title": "Why do people haggle over FIXED fees?",
      "selftext": "Hi all, I'm in need of a moan/ explanation! \n\nSo quick background I'm a self-employed central heating engineer by trade. But like most self-employed people now I can do a bit of everything to a high degree. \n\nWell, a few years ago I fell in with one of those 24hr call out companies. It started as the odd job here and there, then evolved to where we're now where I get 2/3 jobs a week from them. Not enough for a stable income but nice to top up the weekly bank balance. I'm friendly with mostly everyone in the office and a few managers. To the point I sometimes get invited to team building things and last year got an Xmas party invite. \n\nTheir prices are simple and laid out both online and when u call. It's £90 for the first hour, then £60 for each hour. Which jumps to £120/ £90 for \"out of hours\" (anything after 6pm, which I think is quiet fair). They charge a bit more bcoz they promise someone within a couple hours and have dozens of tradesmen on the books. Now these fees are fixed and non-negotiable, it doesn't matter if I'm there 1 or 59 minutes, it's gonna cost u £90. Most of the jobs I get are 30-45 mins, with only a few going into the second hour and it's rare to hit a third or fourth (having had maybe 3? In the whole time I've been with them). I also try to be fair and if a job runs over that next hour by 5-10 minutes I won't charge for it, I don't like ripping people off. This has paid off for me as I always leave a card and have gotten some additional work via this.\n\nSo I get a call today about a leak under a kitchen sink. It's only 20 minutes from my current job so I agree and pop off. I arrive to a nice house with a rather nice Audi out front. I knock on the door and a woman in a pant suit holding a phone answers, I explain who I am and what I'm doing and her first question is \"will this take long?\" I say I don't know till I look with a chuckle, met by stonewall silence, ok then.\n\nI get in, she asks me to take my shoes off, ok. (It's a tile floor and I'm coming from my van, up a paved drive but I get some people are particular so it's fine). Check under the sink and sure enough I find the leak (it's the stop cock) so I go out, turn off the water, go to my van get what I need then go back in and drain the pipes.\n\nI undo the leaking stuffing box (which was already loose) and with some PTFE repair it. I check everything, turn water back on, check again and sure enough yep everything is done. Job took maybe 15-20 minutes with 5 mins being be taking my shoes on and off. I explain it's all done and she looks at me like I've shot her dog. Bare in mind she has hovered over me the entire time, not talking, just playing on her phone.\n\n\"Thas it?\" She said, I explain that yeah, it's a common issue and easily sorted. \"I'm not paying u £90 for 10 mins work\" I explain well, ur not, ur paying for my years of experience and knowledge in diagnosis and skills to fix it. She then grabs a £20 note and thrusts it at me and says \"I think this is more than fair\". Again I explain that no, it isn't, I did the job, u were told the price and it doesn't matter how long I take, the job is the job. She's starts complaining and then threatens to ring the company. I say no need, I'll ring them. So I did and put her on after I explained she's refusing to pay. She starts with the same bullshit and I can hear the guy try and explain and she gets progressively more aggressive. She ends up hanging up after clearly not getting her own way. \"I'm not giving u £90\" \n\nSo now I'm annoyed, so I play my trump card. I get my phone and begin recording, say \"I'm now recording for video proof that you are refusing payment for the job completed at the price that was quoted. That's fine, I will report this as a non-payment to the company, they will then instigate legal action against u. Claiming not only loss of earnings, but most likely legal costs and other expenses which can reach into the hundreds or even thousands. Can you now confirm that you're refusing to pay?\" She went quiet so I press and then she storms off. So I say I'll take that as a yes. \n\nI then leave, go to my van and get off her drive (some people are petty enough to call the police for trespassing) I then fill out the online form for job completion noting that it was a refusal of payment and upload the video I took. This isnt a 5 minute thing as it's got loads of boxes to fill. I then get a knock on the window and she's standing there, I undo my window and she passes me the full £90 with venom in her eyes and storms off.\n\nSo I rang the company and explained she's paid but a note should be put on file. I'm assured that it has. I get the manager on and he apologies and I say it isn't his fault. I wasn't worried as I've had this happen a couple times before and the company just pays me themselves anyway if the client doesn't. I'm now going to get a KFC and chill out before going back to work. I just don't understand the mentality, no doubt if I'd taken 1 hour 10 minutes shee refuse the extra. I get it, things are tough at the moment but it isn't my fault I'm just a regular guy trying to pay his bills and feed his family. ",

It's about how the world will truly become a dystopia worse than what you'd find in the likes of Cyberpunk. Also I am not anti-work, I am anti-working below what we are worth. I am not familiar with this subreddit, so I don't know what the narrative is.\n\nWe're already in a hyper capitalistic model where even the upper middle class are struggling to meet the standard of living that the median salary could provide a decade ago. Imagine how fucked the world would be when we're working around the clock making new legislations as automation wipes out over half the jobs in every field. The several trillionaires reaping the rewards, and trust me there's going to be over a dozen of them given the trajectory we're moving. We don't even have a model for universal base income yet the frame work of every institution would crumble if we were to employ it right now at metric, simply because automation isn't there yet.\n\nDoesn't feel like any government is taking this issue seriously. They're just busy trying to be at the front of the AI race, while the average folks are just an after thought. \"Well they've managed so far in the hyper capitalistic model, they'll learn to adapt when they're out of work too\", is what they're thinking. If we're opening Pandora's Box in good faith, we should be in talks about revising the global economic model now, not later. But that's just not how the world works, the top 1% of the top 1% calls all the shots and they do not want to be taken down from their pedestal. They'd rather watch the world burn before they give up their status, and this is backed up by historical evidence.\n\nUniversal base income needs to be soft launched in the coming 2-3 years. Economic system reform needs to be talked about in full transparency, no bullshitting around. If you think the wealth disparity is bad now, you don't even want to imagine what it's going to be like in the next 10 years. We're all talking about WW3, fearing about blowing each other up, but no one seems to care that we're facing the actual collapse of society that every institution is pushing for. No one is championing the dialogue for a sustainable system, they only care about filling their pockets before we get there.",

      "selftext": "So a couple of years ago I changed jobs to another auto shop where I became the parts manager. Because it's at cycling distance from home the savings alone left 300 € extra in my pocket every month. \n\nThe thing is my boss and upper management are insufferable micromanagers. On a number of occasions I was being directly addressed in meetings with suppliers, government inspectors and whatnot and people decided to speak for me. Am I so stupid I can't speak for myself?\nSome things they do are just outright shameless. \n\nLast year they took on a repair of a microcar with a slightly odd Lombardini diesel none of the mechanics knew about. Instead of rejecting the job outright or contracting with a specialised shop I town, they went and ruined the engine. Not only did they charge an old retired lady over a 1000 € for the bodged repair, they ended having to send it to the specialist and charged 800 € more!\nEarlier this year my own car broke down just outside the shop with an injector leaking fuel into the engine. For a simple repair consisting of pulling the injectors and fitting a sealing kit I was charged 8 hours labour because they had a clueless panel beater do the job and I paid for the time he took to learn how to do it.\n\nThe cherry was over a month ago: my boss convinced himself I had misordered a batch of parts and told me I wasn't right in the head and he would charge me 18 000 € if I couldn't return the lot. Before my time in the firm they never even bought a single part abroad because they couldn't speak English. It's a place so lost in old ways they would pay all suppliers by cheque. \n\n\nLast month a shop contacted me with a better offer. I waited until I got my house mortgage signed by the bank.

They told me to tell my manager my new start date which was 4 weeks away, Plenty of time. When I told my manager he seemed happy for me but at the same time he seemed miffed about the whole thing. After a few days I gotten the offer letter and signed in and let him know. He then proceeded to ask me for my offer letter to which I asked what info he needed and he replied just with \"To review the letter\" I said I'd have to ask HR since I signed it and its gone now. Called HR and they even said not to give it to him since its not his business to know whats on there and that he should contact the other department. I told him that and he then requested their names. I messaged them and told them he wanted to review my offer letter to which they even said do not do that. They said they will message him to see what exactly he needs to know more than the starting date. \n\nThis whole experience makes me feel as he has been sabotaging my ability to go to another department since this is the first time a department just skipped over him and just hired me right away and now hes making a big stink about it even though he told me that my work/life balance does not fit well with the department. \n\nAm I crazy?\n\nEdit: Got confirmation from the other department, My start date is still a go. However my manager never messaged me to let me know he spoke to them. Im guessing they told him to go pound sand.",

      "selftext": "A few years back, I was a QA manager for a large 3rd-party call center company - basically other companies would farm out their customer support calls to us because we could do it cheaper.  At the time this happened, I had three supervisors under me, each with 5-15 QA reviewers under them.  The QA reviewers would listen to the recorded calls and make sure that the agents were following the correct procedures, etc. \n \nThe operations team (basically management for the phone agents) got approval for an incentive payout for the phone agents, where if they met their weekly scheduled hours, they would get an additional $1/hr for that pay period. I should point out here that to be on QA, you needed to be a high-performing agent on that project, and it came with a $0.50/hr bump.  If you’re following, that means after they rolled out the incentive, you would actually be taking a pay cut to work in QA. As a result, we were completely unable to fill any vacancies on the team because who the hell is going to take a pay cut for a “promotion”!\n\nI raised this numerous times; to my manager, to his manager, and to her manager (the Sr. VP in charge of our department) and was told in no uncertain terms that the pay structure was put in place by the COO and was “working as intended”.  Goals slipped (because we were under-staffed) and I guess eventually I was such a pain in the ass about it that they added me to their weekly “exec” call with all the big wigs from ops and the COO (who I learnt later had the reputation for being a complete asshole; apparently every week on that call he would pick someone to rip to shreds in front of everyone; I guess my managers had decided to throw me under the bus).  When they got to my program on the agenda, the COO asked me why we were missing our targets;  I explained that we couldn’t staff because no one wanted to take a pay cut to work for us, and explained the gap in the pay structure that was causing it.  Dead silence on the call.  “Well that’s not intentional - Wayne (our VP), get it fixed”.  \n\nThe next week, all of my sups and analysts got a $1.50/hr raise, based on pay for the position was raised by $1.50/hr, and for the rest of my time there my management never let me forget it.  Anytime anything went wrong, they’d rub my nose in it.  Anytime we missed a target, they’d rub my nose in it.  Anytime I tried to get concessions for my team… you guessed it, rubbed my nose in it.  \n\nI left that job for a non-management role at a different company and I’m never ever willingly managing people again.  You work hard to do the best you can for your people, and it’s nothing but eating shit from upper management for it.  Plenty of my peers were more than happy to fuck them over to benefit themselves.  I’m not naive enough to think that it’s different at any other company, but I’m not going to participate anymore. \n\nThe sad thing is?  That’s exactly what the execs want.  They don’t want people in charge who give a damn about their people, they want the assholes who will dick down their employees for even the smallest gains. ",

      "selftext": "[I understand the irony of having a \"SFW\" on my moniker in an antiwork subreddit. The origin of this username is that I needed a nekkid-lady free subreddit favorites list if I was going to surf reddit at work. So SFW really is in the classic \"no boobies in front of your boss\" way]\n\nMy story vault is deep, but this is happening right now and therefore feels a lot more relevant to share. I work at the front desk of an orthopedic clinic in the outpatient building of a large hospital in an eastern state. Up until a recent management change, things in my department ran rather well. Everyone, including me, was happy. But then the \"foot-down\" nonsense started and now it's a shit gig. The big change for me personally was the banning of web surfing between patients. I now go bonkers rather than pleasantly entertaining myself, keeping myself fresh for the next check-in (or out). We can't surf. We can't be on our phones. This has greatly affected the poor students who used to rely on between-patient times to do homework. We're encouraged to find something to do but there IS nothing to do. Throughout the two years of good time, I often talked about how the big thing that keeps me even keel is that we can relax between check-ins. This is really taking its toll.\n\nBut today there was a nice little cherry on top. After my lunch break, I came back to my manager chatting up the nurse manager in the rear of the front desk area. It blocks my way in, so I had to (as politely as I could muster) excuse myself past them to get to my seat and start the unnecessarily long log-in process on my workstation.\n\nSo nurse manager clears the way and manager gets all of our attention. There are four of us. I have been previously coached about not engaging when leadership engages the team in this manner, so I was sure to offer my rapt attention. My previous response to the claim I didn't engage the speaker in these cases was simple: If the conversation is not relevant to me, I tune out. I fully admitted - if you're talking about work - even a tangentially related subject like a medical breakthrough or something - then I'm all in. If it relates to my job I'm dialed into the conversation. All the way. I just admitted that I disconnect when the subject doesn't concern me. That was actually well received during that mostly uncomfortable conversation.\n\nSo manager has the attention of all four of us. She thanks us for our time and has an important question to ask. The question?\n\n\"So are we going to decorate a team pumpkin this year?\" [\"this year\" being curious word selection to me, as she only hit the team over the summer] So yeah, she wanted to know if the front desk team was going to decorate a pumpkin this year, as each year our outpatient building does a pumpkin decorating \"competition\" where the \"winning\" team gets a tour of places they don't usually get to go.\n\nThe moment she finished her sentence, she happened to have rested her eyes on me. My jaw dropped a little. Then my eyes opened wide, I smiled as big as I could, and continued looking her in the eye as I twirled my office chair around back facing my desk. My contempt was probably pretty palpable though I didn't say a word or look at anyone other than her. My coworkers got excited about it and they talked straight through 'til the end of my shift. That's a briefer time than you might think - my lunch time slot (that I chose) gives me an hour between the time I get back from lunch and when I leave. During that time, I checked in a patient and checked out two more while they talked about it. I audibly reacted when my manager exclaimed we can look up ideas on Pinterest between patients! That was when I cracked a little, with the surfing ban still very much fresh with me.\n\nI didn't get any post-shift texts from my coworkers, who get off 30, 60, and 90 minutes after me. That generally means it was uneventful after I left. But I am anxious to see if I'm called into another meeting for my completely intentional reaction. Time to go to bed! I need to be fresh just in case.",

      "title": "Toxic non-profit controlled by a narcissistic dictator (feat. egotistical leaders)",
      "selftext": "I work for a non profit and I recently discovered some pretty shady things. I will list them all below:\n\n1. Micromanagement is EXTREME. They record all of our calls with donors and they never disclosed this to us nor the donors. They read all of our messages, emails, they track our work under a microscope, and they record all of our meetings.\n\n2. We have recurring donations set by default as a way to trick people into donating (And our CEO says \"they most likely won't notice and if they do, they'll be too hesitant and feel guilty to ask for a refund\")\n\n3. HR updates our Employee handbooks multiple times a year as a result of an employee who does something the CEO doesn't like (ex. It was never mandatory to have cameras on during meetings but when people would keep their camera off, HR implemented the rule on the employee hand book and forced employees to sign or face termination).\n\n4. The CEO always bitches about the budget but approves a high budget for an unnecessary project that he simply just likes rather than a much needed project that he doesn't like, which causes a higher workload on employees needed to complete said project.\n\n5. HR is sending out feedback forms as a means to hear the employees and make changes towards a positive work environment but I'm 100% sure it's a trap to terminate those who have too much to say OR a trap to change the employee handbook again. I am certain of this because a few months ago, there was an investigation towards a manager that was reported by multiple people to HR. HR launched the investigation in a very indirect way (did not tell employees what the investigation was for and asked very ambiguous questions) and the result of it was that the manager still works with us but the CEO threatened to fire anyone bad mouthing the org or anyone in management. There was also speculation that one of the employees is a \"Mole\" who builds trust with employees and reports everything they say back to the CEO.\n\n4. Whenever someone speaks up about something unethical in the organization, there is usually a response after 2 whole weeks from HR, staging a meeting to make the employee feel seen, just to terminate them at the end of the meeting and by the very next day, they already hired a replacement (which tells me the 2 week delay was used solely to hire a back up employee under wraps)\n\n5. The CEO is completely two faced and verbally abusive. He puts on a smile and positive energy in front of everyone but unprofessionally scolds, threatens, and disrespects employees in one-on-one settings. He gives people false hope that he's on their side and throws them under the bus immediately after. He's been reported numerous times by previous staff and all of those employees ended up terminated.\n\n6. The CEO uses donor funds for personal expenses. There are several transactions on the ledger that show personal expenses as little as a coffee to as big as an all paid business class trip abroad in a 5-star hotel for his entire family. Which leads me to my next point...\n\n7. The CEO crosses major integrity lines due to his hunger for money (See point 2). He feels threatened and shuts down anyone who proposes an idea that prioritizes anything else other than the money (Ex. There was a donor that has donated and volunteered in the past and complained that we never update him on projects he's donated to. I suggested we use our time and resources to launch an initiative for donors to keep active track of projects they've donated to. The CEO responds by saying \"Doing that is going to take time away from making solicitation calls and it's better to lose one donor with a bad experience than losing money from solicitation calls\"). Whenever we host an event, he tells us to tell donors that 100% of ticket sales goes towards donations even though ticket sales are used to cover the cost of the event in reality. When an employee solicits a donation, instead of congratulating them, he scolds them for not getting a bigger donation. He's quick in having us generate donations without figuring out where the donations are going towards first.\n\n8. Everyone else in leadership is the CEO's puppet and when they're free to make their own decisions, they only make decisions based on their bias (Ex. if an employee proposes a logical project but someone in leadership wants the opposite project, even though it's poorly designed and less successful, they will sabotage the original idea just so that their idea get chosen).\n\n9. People in management lack leadership, transparency, and good decision making. There is an upcoming event that I was told my attendance was required. I got excited about it as I really wanted to attend (and even postponed travel plans) until my coworker mentioned that the budget was cut and I probably won't be attending. It wasn't until I went out of my way to ask my manager was I told that I wasn't attending. I have been putting in more work than anyone else on my team for the success of this event. Then I find out that my other coworker was sent to the event 2 weeks in advance even though she resides in a different state, on the opposite side of the nation, is paid hourly, and is completely unfamiliar with the area. I reside in the same state the event is held in, know that area better than anyone else, and am paid salary so it would have been significantly cheaper to send me to the event rather than my colleague. Now I find out that said colleague is just out there hooking up with tinder matches, getting high at the beach, and meeting up with online friends rather than working. But in general, leadership makes bad decisions with finances, donors, programs, etc. There is absolutely no logic behind their decisions and seems like they just make them entirely based off of desire or mood.\n\n10. There are a lot of liars in leadership that put off blame yet they accuse everyone below them of lying. Regarding the event, when I asked my manager why I wasn't attending, she said it wasn't her decision, it was the event coordinator's decision. So I ask the event coordinator why I wasn't attending and he says it wasn't his decision, it was my manager's decision. Regarding a different event, management told us to lie to donors and tell them we were raising funds for X beneficiaries (because people were more empathetic towards them) even though we were really raising the funds for Y beneficiaries. Early in my employment, my manager told me to launch a project but stopped me half way through and told me it was a waste of resources. Months later, stakeholders asked why this project was never finished and my manager throws me under the bus in a CC'd email stating \"why did you abandon this project? It was supposed to be done months ago! Go complete it now!\". Yet the one time I told my manager I completed a task but forgot to log my work, she called me a liar in a meeting with HR and said I was too untrustworthy to be employed, which resulted in me being put under a performance review.\n\n11. The entire board is made up of close personal friends of the CEO and they're the only ones that make the decision of keeping him or firing him. All of the employees that got fired reporting the CEO was due to the friends of his on the board.\n\n12. Just in this year alone, we've had a total of 6 employees so far who quit on the spot or were fired and left on extremely bad terms (the entire org is only 12 employees, so that's half of the staff there). Previous years follow the same pattern; anyone who has ever left the org either by choice or force has had the org entirely burn that bridge. But when the org becomes desperate for staff, they reach out to those same employees with a lowball contractor offer and expect them to say yes.\n\n13. The org pays volunteers way more than their employees. There is constantly a push for long term \"volunteers\" but it was discovered that these volunteers are being paid more hourly than most employees. The entire purpose of a volunteer is someone willing to contribute without financial compensation.\n\n14. The CEO constantly mispronounces people's names. This point doesn't have as much magnitude as other points but it's pretty disrespectful to have people on your team for months and continuously butcher their name, even though their names are being said properly by other staff AND are written on the zoom calls. It almost seems like a power move to belittle the person, considering how narcissistic he is.\n\n15. There is an annual retreat for all employees (staff and management). It's the one time where the company takes care of the staff and rewards them for their hard work. We get to travel to a new site each year and really enjoy our time. This year, they claimed they don't have the budget for it yet everyone in management got to have a leadership retreat. In turn, we are still having a retreat but it's a low budget retreat held over an all day zoom call on a SATURDAY and we're all required to attend.\n\n16. When there are work conferences, we are expected to share rooms. I didn't think too much of this at first because I went to a lot of conferences in high school and had to share a room but I realized that was IN HIGH SCHOOL, not a professional environment. A few people who have traveled for work before brought up to me that it's incredibly inappropriate to have us share rooms and the more I thought about it, the more I agree. Every employee is remote so when there are conferences, we're having to share a room with a complete stranger. It's incredibly inconvenient to have to be up early, stand on your feet all day, and then go back to share a room with a stranger who keeps you up all night with their snoring. After the most recent convention, I found out that my manager got her own room which in return gave the other coworker (who was supposed to bunk with her) her own room. Yet when I asked for my own accommodation due to a medical reason, my manager told me I had to pay for my own room out of pocket. I asked her why then she and the other employee each got to have their own rooms, she said \"because we both like having our privacy\".\n\n17. Response times from management are practically non-existent yet a high standard is placed on staff. Management takes DAYS to respond to a request and when you don't finish a task because you are pending their response, they report you to HR for poor performance. Yet when they message staff at 4:52 pm on Friday, asking for a big task, the employee is required to reply within a few minutes and expected to start on the assignment since it was \"technically\" assigned before then end of the workday and continue it over the weekend before the next workday or else we'll look like we're slacking. My manager reported me to HR for taking 40 minutes to respond to her message (I was on my lunch break) but I have been waiting 2.5 weeks for her to approve my project charter.\n\n18. The CEO makes jokes about us getting limited holidays off. Unlike most companies, we only receive less than half of the calendared holidays off. When someone recently made a remark in a meeting about going to the beach on Columbus day, the CEO laughed and said \"You wish you had Columbus day off! You all already get enough days off\". So we're required to work on a federal holiday and he makes a remark about how he's going golfing with his buddies while we \"hold down the fort\".\n\n19. Staff with children get way more perks and excuses than those who don't. Regardless of my job, I have always been extremely against people using their children as an excuse out of work mostly because people really tend to abuse that excuse. One incident, I got sick in the middle of the work day and began vomiting so I had to cancel all my meetings for the day. My manager called me unprofessional and said I was required to request the day off at least 48 hours prior (as if I scheduled my stomach virus in advance) yet other employees with kids, MULTIPLE times week, take half days without informing anyone in advance \"to pick up their kids from school\", leave meetings early because \"their kids want a snack\", reschedule meetings last minute because \"their kids got fussy\" and management + the CEO completely turn a blind eye.\n\nThese are just a HANDFUL of things that I've seen in the short time I've been employed with this organization. I had volunteered for this organization years prior when it was under completely different leadership and really liked the mission - which is what led me to apply for a job.\n\nMy first red flag is when the person who's job I replaced was training me, she called me and vented for hours about how toxic this work place was. I convinced myself that each person has their own experience but to be honest, I just really needed the money and health insurance.\n\nI told myself that I'll just ride it out until I find a better opportunity. So I am currently looking for other employment though it's difficult considering most companies are in office and I have very niche experience. I don't know how long I can mentally stay in this job but I do know that once I leave, either by choice or force, I am going to burn the organization to the ground.\n\n",

This office has never been my favorite but, the pay is decent and so are my hours. So, our office manager never wants to be labeled “the bad guy” so, she wanted to basically bring in someone to do her job. Someone she can tell to come down on us and have them be the bad guy. Anyways, I should have been offered the supervisor job, I know the job extremely well and I’m good at it. I get compliments from our patients regularly. The issue was I cannot work Fridays so apparently that deemed me unfit to be the supervisor. Whatever I didn’t wanna be the bitch and be bitched at anyways. So, they hire this guy, he came in and for the first few weeks I felt like he was incredibly fair, super nice, treated us as equals with him instead of making him seem above all of us. Well, that all changed this week… he is criticizing literally everything. He goes out of his way to find things we are missing. He actually nitpicked how I left a voicemail today. He takes no ownership for anything and if he accuses me or anyone else of anything, and you defend yourself, he gets very defensive and just basically calls you a liar. He talks down to us like we are children. I don’t know if anyone has any sound advice besides, looking for a new job (I’m doing that already). While I have to weather the bullshit, please help! Today I got so irritated with him bc I was there for 5mins and he had a list of criticisms. I got so mad I cried (not so he could see) but, my mental health seriously cannot handle this everyday. Any tips or advice is so appreciated. ",

      "selftext": "Where I work we get a good amount of time off per year like 4 times out of the year off.

We’re waiting for a visa so I know in 2026 he’ll be back in the country and we don’t need to worry about long distance. \n\nWe have a December break coming up and I booked my ticket in March. There was also our summer August break that lasted two weeks. I extended the break by two days and I asked HR if that along with leaving a day earlier for December break would be alright. I asked before flight tickets were even booked. HR agreed it was fine and wouldn’t be any issues. \n\nI have a lot of personal days that I haven’t used and I wanted to take a personal day to put on my December break. We’re allowed to use up to 8 personal days for whatever we chose to use them towards. Then in January we get additional days and if we don’t use these days by July we get an additional paycheck. \n\nMy husband and I wanted to change my flight ticket for me to come a day earlier so I won’t miss Christmas Eve. I asked HR if that was ok and the same person told me that if I take off the 22nd or 23rd it would affect my job performance and how much I’ll get for my holiday bonus. She also CC’ed my boss onto the email which felt like an extra sting. This same woman knew on 3 separate occasions that I was going away and confirmed all those times it would be fine. Even in the email conversation it didn’t make much sense. In one email she said it would be a problem towards my observation and I wouldn’t get a full bonus. Then in another email she attached from August showed her saying it would be alright as long as I attach flight documentation. I have sent her the same ticket a few times prior so it’s all in the records. \n\nI understand asking for that additional day would be an issue. But all this time it seemed taking off the 23rd wouldn’t be an issue and this is something she knew about and confirmed many of times. I’m just so disappointed I was so looking forward to my bonus and I don’t want this to hurt my job performance. My dad helped me send the perfect email to HR and my boss.

They're running a show we never bought tickets for, and I'm ready for the credits to roll.\n\nFrom the student graduating into inescapable debt, to the mother struggling to make rent. Parents have to explain to their kids why the dental work they need is going to have to wait. The gap between what we were guaranteed as American citizens and what we got is insurmountable for all but the most privileged. The people who deserve the least get the most, and those that need the most get the least. This system has failed and it was designed to do just that.\n\nThe FDA staffed by pharmaceutical executives. FCC commissioners from telecom companies. The SEC is populated by Wall Street alumni. EPA heads from polluting industries. The revolving door spins so fast it's invisible. They're not even trying to hide it anymore. *Regulate your future employer gently, collect your reward after*. \n\nThe referees work for one team. The guards were hired by the prisoners. A Fox is the head of Henhouse Industries.\n\nPoor education was pushed as a way to retain voter demographics. Funding tied to property taxes ensures generational inequality. When the citizenry does not even know their rights, how can they possibly stand up to defend them? As regulatory capture encroaches on our rights, politicians evade and avoid. The media casually manages to never ask hard questions; never rocking the boat, only rocking the cradle. The beautiful faces on the news were used to sing us a sweet lullaby of lackadaisical attitudes and dulled senses. They turned out the lights, and it's time we turned them back on. \n\nEDUCATED CITIZENS ASK UNCOMFORTABLE QUESTIONS  \nstruggling populations accept the answers they're given\n\nRegulatory capture is complete. There is no democracy, there is only the ignorance of a bygone era refusing to take a bow and sod off.\n\nGerrymandering killed elections.   \nJack-booted thugs killed whistleblowers.  \nAnd the surveillance state killed freedom for anyone asking too many questions. \n\nIt's time the ones who brought us here, the names on **the list** be called to account for what is happening.

I then had to have a talk with them about it, in which they brought up that it was the 7th time this has happened, that it's a problem, and if I sign in late again, I have to sign an agreement stating that the next time I sign on late, I will be fired. Last week although I was online and working, I forgot to send the sign on message until 32 minutes after I should have, and had to sign the agreement.\n\nThose 7 times happened over the course of 5 years and it had not happened prior to this last time for over a year. And okay, I get that oversleeping is not great but it has never affected my ability to get my work done, nor does it affect anyone else's. I have not had any other issues or complaints about my job performance in over 6 years. The week before signing this agreement, my boss was asking me to help out a coworker with something because I'm so great at that particular task. Then this.\n\nAfter signing the agreement, my boss messages me about how they hope I resolve this because they love working with me and I'm important to the \"team\" and they don't want to have to let me go. So then don't? My boss literally owns the company I work for. If they don't want to fire me, they don't have to. But they would rather let 7 days of being late matter more than the other 1300ish days of being on time, with those 7 days being of absolutely no consequence anyway. \n\nI've been continuously learning this lesson as time goes on, but here's my reminder not to strive to be a good worker. It ultimately doesn't matter in the end and is only detrimental my own wellbeing. I wish I had worked a lot less hard at this job for the first 4 years but I started to catch on more in the past couple. I'm looking for a new job.",

I’ve been in healthcare for quite some time in various positions, clinical support, as well as non-clinical admin roles. I was very excited to get into this massive healthcare organization via this affiliate.\n\nI work as an office coordinator at this affiliate and I’m good at what I do, I was nominated for both first and second quarter, and I’m only a year there. Providers and my coworkers feel comfortable coming to me for questions and support. I work consistent overtime pretty much daily. The affiliate has had a lot of turnover in upper management our previous county sites supervisor was fired. My lead rage quit a few months ago (effectively making me the lead without the title or pay bump). It has been hellish. This new supervisor is something else entirely. I’m used to especially in healthcare, a certain level of toxicity. This manager is incredibly unprofessional she consistently posts weird memes in our teams chat with inappropriate statements. The latest teams message was a meme, and telling us that she has bad news she “forgot” to add in OT for the last paycheck. When people started respond she told us she “just works here lol.”\n\nShe sits for two hours in her car outside of our affiliate in patient parking spots smoking and taking meeting loudly with the windows down. (patients have complained). She’s nowhere to be found when providers need to get a hold of her for something on site.\n\nToday, I one of my coworkers texts me a picture of the chat that has a meme with the added caption about quarterlies saying, “some of y’all been acting up.”\nShe has posted continuously in the work chat about wanting us to donate to her sons fundraising program. And has also complained that we’re not giving her enough attention throughout the day. With memes about how quiet we’ve been.\n\nIt’s just everyday. I’ve been trying to transfer, talking to internal recruiters, but the last I heard there have been layoffs in multiple departments in the company I’m at a loss. I feel so demoralized and full of anxiety everyday.\n\nTLDR: I feel like I’m being held hostage and unable to to transfer, and my new supervisor is widely u professional.",

If you don't want to telework and would prefer to go into the office then good for you, that option can still be there for you to haul your ass to an office everyday but all people should be given the option to live a better more well balanced life rather than being forced to be chained to a small desk for 75% of their waking hours.\n\nWhy is that the life people are fighting for?",

This is the most important step. Don't go it alone.\n2. Agree on ONE specific \"no\" that you will both practice for the rest of the week. It has to be concrete and measurable.\n3. Back each other up. When one of you holds the line, the other is there to support them. If management asks questions, they have to talk to both of you.\n\nWhat could a \"no\" look like? \n\n* **\"No, we cannot take on that last-minute project. Our workload is at capacity.\"** \n* **\"No, we will not be responding to emails after 6 PM.\"** \n* **\"No, we are taking our full, uninterrupted lunch hour.\"**\n\nRemember the most important rule: One person saying \"no\" is a target. Two or more people saying \"no\" is the start of a new policy.\n\nThis isn't about being negative or difficult. This is about saying YES to our health, YES to our families, and YES to having a life. Every collective \"no\" is a crack in the foundation of this burnout system. So, who's in? Find your person. Make your pact. What's the first \"no\" you would put into practice?\n\n**TL;DR: I'm proposing we fight burnout by finding at least one coworker and making a \"Pact of No.\" Agree on ONE specific boundary to enforce together (like no emails after hours) and back each other up.

      "selftext": "The Story of Two Woodcutters —Why You Should Sharpen Your Axes\nOnce upon a time, there were two woodcutters named Peter and John. They were often at loggerheads over who chopped more wood. So one day, they decided to hold a competition to determine the winner. The rules were simple—whoever produce the most wood in a day wins.\n\nSo the next day morning, both of them took up their positions in the forest and started chopping away in their fastest possible speed. This lasted for an hour before Peter suddenly stopped. When John realized that there was no chopping sound from his opponent’s side, he thought: “Ah Ha! He must be tired already!” And he continued to cut down his trees with double the pace.\n\nA quarter of an hour passed, and John heard his opponent chopping again. So both of them carried on synchronously. John was starting to feel weary when the chopping from Peter stopped once again. Feeling motivated and smelling victory close by, John continued on, with a smile on his face.\n\nThis went on the whole day. Every hour, Peter would stop chopping for fifteen minutes while John kept going relentlessly. So when the competition ended, John was absolutely confident that he would take the triumph.\n\nBut to John’s astonishment, Peter had actually cut down more wood. How did this even happen? “How could you have chopped down more trees than me? I heard you stop working every hour for fifteen minutes!”, exclaimed John.\n\nPeter replied, “Well, it’s really simple. Every time I stopped work, while you were still chopping down trees, I was sharpening my axe.”\n\nEverybody, everywhere seems to be busy. Most people are just too busy doing and trying to achieve that they do not take the necessary time to renew themselves, to learn and grow—to sharpen the “axe”.\n\nHow exactly do you sharpen the axe?\n\nWe overwork ourselves amidst the overwhelming tasks at hand. We feel drained, exhausted and our productivity declines. Do we simply take a break, rest and relax? That isn’t sharpening the axe—that’s just putting the axe down. The blade will still be dull after your break. Yes, the woodcutter needs to rest, but it’s only when he sharpens his blade, learns new techniques, trains up his strength and stamina, that he becomes more productive.\n\nDr. Stephen R Covey defined “Sharpen Your Saw (or Axe)” to be: increasing your personal productivity, by having a balanced strategy to renew yourself in the four aspects of life: Physical, Social, Mental, and Spiritual.\n\nPhysical: Eating well, sleeping well and exercising well.\nSocial/Emotional: Having a good social life. Building meaningful connections with others.\nMental: Learning something new, reading (books are your mentors), and writing.\nSpiritual: Expanding spiritual self through meditation, spending time relaxing in nature.\nFeeling good doesn’t just happen. You need to take the necessary time to create growth and change in your life. Arianna Huffington urges us to sleep our way to increased productivity, happiness, and smarter decision-making. Warren Buffet credits his great money decisions to his voracious reading habit (80% of his time is spent on reading). Toyota invests time and money into their employees, developing a continuous improvement culture—a true model for a learning organization.\n\nRemember that every day is a brand new opportunity to recharge, renew, and refine yourself. Devote some moments into sharpening your axe instead of chopping away doggedly: start working smarter instead of longer.\n\n\nhttps://youtube.com/shorts/MSKMoruSaY4?si=ri0Bxjabs7XPsZ2z\n\nhttps://screeble.com/story-of-two-woodcutters/#google_vignette",

      "selftext": "\nExactly three weeks ago I started a new job at the biggest university in my state. I finally have good benefits and after sixth months, I’ll be able to get full tuition assistance. I applied to about thirty jobs here before I got hired - working here was my dream. \n\nThere’s just a catch, I am completely miserable.\n\nI started out three weeks ago, and right off the bat, there was no training. I sit next to my manager’s cubicle and he spoke to me at most a couple times a day. I made use of the time by finding training videos provided by the university, but other than that, I had no clue what I was doing. He left me behind for meetings we were asked to go to together, and overall seemed very  bothered by me. And I know training a new person can be draining - but this felt like a whole different level. I chalked it up to first week nerves and inexperience, then came week two. \n\nPart of my new job responsibilities include processing reimbursements. I like details and systems, but am aware of my weaknesses as a learner. I was honest about these in my interview. I take my time with learning because I’m neurotic, and I want to learn to do things right. I’m not afraid to ask questions - this was another thing I mentioned in my interview. Anyway - on the second week I received one training session on how to process reimbursements worth thousands of dollars. After that, they just started throwing the rest at me. Every time I asked a question I was met with exasperation and a hurried answer with no explanation of why this process was done at all. I just feel lost at this point, I am lost. Lost while doing very important tasks worth thousands of dollars, too. The pressure is really intense. \n\nI know everything I know at this job because I’ve genuinely bothered someone to learn it. And I say that because of my most basic understanding of body language. Rolling eyes, frowning, physical distance, and what I can’t describe as anything other than a sort of silent treatment. Today, while I was sitting at my cubicle, a coworkers came up to my manager, pointed at me, and whispered “how’s that going?” She could’ve been pointing to the empty wall behind me, but I certainly feel like the “that” in question at this point. \n\nI feel like I’m in an experiment of how long someone can last in a strange, silent, and hostile work environment. I could not stop crying after my shift today. I’ve been having full body shakes what feels like the whole day, and I really can’t pinpoint why. Why is this job so psychologically devastating? I’ve been an elementary school teacher and a receptionist - neither were this taxing or hostile. \n\nI ask you to explain, please, because it feels deeply psychological. I went straight from my last job to this one. I am a hard worker and know  I am capable of learning and adjusting just as well as any coworker.\n\nI’m really questioning if this is worth the toll on my mental health at this point. Today I thought about skipping my flu shot this year on the chance I’d fall ill and get some days off. I’m not sure if this is a toxic workplace or something I’m missing — how do I tell the difference? \n\nTL;DR: Got dream job at university but no training, coworkers hostile and cold, and I feel deeply demoralized. Why does this feel so psychologically heavy when I’ve handled stereotypically harder jobs?\n\n\n\n",

These days I’ve worked a lot purely only in the office, the reason is they really liked my customer service skills but again they’re telling me “we want you to get more experience”. I literally only took this job because they said the travelling was optional at the very beginning but when they told me I need to travel again it’s making me want to quit. Of course I won’t but what can I tell my manager to try and stop it? \n\nOne of my coworkers said that he mentioned to my manager that his wife gets upset and worried when he leaves so he no longer has to. \n\nMy partner is from a foreign country and I’m the closest thing to her. I was thinking of telling my manager I don’t like to travel because I wish to be close to home incase my partner has an emergency. The current job setup is working perfectly for me (I work 12h night shifts 7-7, which no one else wants to do and we’re very short staffed.) and I really hate the conditions of travel, I get no sleep, they work me up to 16h a day, high stress and fast pace environment and people expect a lot because they’re paying my company a lot to have me there… I have a high anxiety level which I take CBD for and now I’m just hating this job if they make me go.. sorry if it sounds lame to rant about this.\n\nWould appreciate any thoughts, thanks.

Meanwhile, the executives and owners sit in their corner offices, counting profits that we created, never lifting a finger themselves. They build empires off our backs while we scrape by, constantly reminded to “be grateful” for whatever scraps they throw at us.\n\nI’ve sacrificed nights with friends, time with family, even my own mental health, all for a system that doesn’t care about me, about us. The American Dream? A cruel joke. The reality is stress, exhaustion, debt, and fear.\n\nAnd the worst part? I know we’re capable of more. We’re the ones who keep the economy moving, who create the wealth, who sustain society. Yet we’re treated like disposable tools. The system doesn’t fail because of laziness, it fails because it’s designed to exploit us, to grind us down until we forget what living feels like.\n\nI’m angry. I’m in pain. But I’m not silent.

      "selftext": "Long story short, the EU wants all workers to register their hours, and we have to implement and work with some form of registration software.\n\nWhat came out of the training is that yes, you have to clock in and out (via app, physical scanning point (beep!) or online on your profile), but it's as much to your benefit as your employer's: if you work more than 48 hrs/wk on average over 4 months, you may be eligible for compensation. Likewise, if there are fewer than 11 hrs between you clocking off and clocking on, that's a violation on the part of your employer, which in an extreme case can/should be referred to a labour tribunal (separate entity to the employer).\n\nWe have SO MANY rules for PTO. The biggest one is that you MUST take it. Everyone gets 5 weeks of PTO, but e.g. parents also get 5 \"care days\" per child under 7. Parental leave can be interesting, since you can split some of it between the parents. We have a lot of different union groups, and some of them have particular *extra* PTO that must be taken as well. Again, PAID TIME OFF. There are a lot of unions represented amongst our employees, and the company would NEVER go against the agreed-upon union agreement. Again, labour tribunal.\n\nAll sick days are, of course, paid. No need for a doctor's note, you just notify your manager that you're not well, and they will set you as \"sick\" in the system until you're back. The company recoups your wages from the state. As soon as you're back, the system registers you as such. Obviously, if you're out for a long time, you talk to your manager and figure out a plan, but you won't get fired because you broke a leg and need 6 months' rehab.\n\nSo many employees aren't aware of the parameters of their union agreement, but because we have to register them accordingly, they can now log in and see how many days' PTO they have, when their parental leave is, how many extra hours they got for that one project, etc.\n\nPersonally, I love the transparency and the fact that nothing is up for debate or on the whim of a vindictive boss: you know what you're entitled to, they know what they have to give you, and all is right there.\n\nAnd for those of us on the employer's side: we loooove having all the data at our fingertips. We know which union agreement you're employed under, what those parameters are, and if we fucked up, we're more than happy to apologise and award you those extra hours. Because we're also workers.\n\n(No, I'm not bragging, just giving an insight into how a relationship between a company and HR can be.)",

I have a long history of quitting jobs because I couldn’t tolerate the people I worked for (ok, I have some health issues too, that’s part of it,) and now mostly I source my own jobs and work for myself. \n\nI also work a little bit for a housecleaning company, admittedly, not the worst one around. I had to supply all my own stuff ($100+ without reimbursement) but I make a few dollars more than the other local companies and I get to work by myself. I knew I was in trouble one day when she told me she treats all her employees like family. (She lives a thousand miles away from me..I’ll never even see her in person.) \n\n\nI think it should be illegal for employers to say this. It’s in so many job postings. We all laugh about it. We all know it’s not true. When you consider the psychological impacts of familial trauma—being subjected to this kind of subtle manipulation is powerful, outdated, and inappropriate. You want to treat me like family? Well, guess what— my family is a mess. So what are you really saying to me? Why are you even allowed to say that? My family dropped me and abused me as soon as I wasn’t useful enough, and especially at times when my life became complicated. The ironic thing is that these employers will do the exact same thing, (this one already has gotten unpleasant with me after I set simple and commonplace boundaries about my schedule.) making their claim totally true, and I can’t even complain. I know this phrase will never be totally viewed as taboo. At least for generations. So I took to Reddit. Hope you understand! \n\nWhat would a quiet revolt against this terminology look like, if it ever were to exist? I would love to hear your thoughts. ",

I wrote essays about the regulation and its most recent uses and interpretations and then I passed a final exam worth 70% of my grade in the class about that regulation.\n\n I told all of this to the recruiter for the position and he actually responded back with \"yeah but no one has paid you for it.\" He then proceeds to recite the one line of information that he knows about the regulation. \n\nI just can't anymore. I'm getting turned down for jobs cause they think I'm overqualified because of my schooling. Then I'm getting turned down because they want 5 -10 years of direct experience in the role even though the entery level applicant would take 5  -10 years of experience to get to that role. Effectively they want someone with 20 years of experience to work for $18hr.\n\nThere was one job they wanted someone to be the office manager and the bookkeeper for $16hr even sall some CFO duties to perform in their expected responsibilities. \n\nI had to job search through covid and it wasn't this bad. They atleast had work from home, now it's all in office and they will only give you an interview if your with 20min of the office. Like wtf is the highway for now?

I was a Scrum Master/Agile Coach at One Another Giant IT/Tech Company for a five years, then invited to Spain (other \"division\") as a high-skilled professional. Good salary, a nice apartment in 250k town, a future  \n  \nThen I sent a message in a company-wide chat where suggested my colleagues look into joining a union to protect our rights. That's it. That was my \"crime\", bruh  \n  \nDays later, I was called into an office and fired. They called it \"restructuring.\" I call it retaliation. They offered me about €10k to sign a paper and disappear quietly. I refused. It was a matter of principle  \n  \nThat principle cost me everything. My job, my savings, my apartment, my legal status. I spent most of last year in homeless shelters  \n  \nToday, thanks to the Red Cross, I have a small room in one town in Galicia and have €110 to my name. Now fighting a legal battle that could, in theory, win me my job back and around €180k in back pay (50% I have to give to the labor union if I win, since they are handling this case). My appeal has been sitting in a high court for six months with zero updates. I can't leave Spain, or I automatically lose  \n  \nI'm not asking for money. I'm asking for perspective, or maybe any advices how to survive when exists such strict frames and restrictions on rights: my lawyer jokingly calls this \"a legal (juridical) limbo or even Catch-22\" referring to the Spanish system  \n  \nEvery logical part of my brain says I should have taken the money. But my gut says that if people like me don't fight, these corporations will crush everyone. In other words, let's say that \"I'm stuck between principle and pragmatism, living a Kafka or Dostoevskiy novel\"  \n  \nFor anyone who's ever fought a seemingly impossible battle against a system designed to wear you down – what was the one small thing that kept you from giving up?",

      "selftext": "We talk a lot about terrible bosses and toxic workplaces, but I stumbled upon this philosopher (Byung-Chul Han) who I think totally nails the *deeper* reason so many of us feel completely burnt to a crisp.\n\nHe calls our time the **\"Achievement Society,\"** and it's a total mindf\\*ck.\n\nBasically, the old system was a **\"Disciplinary Society.\"** Think factory work. You had a boss who was a clear-cut asshole telling you \"You SHOULD do this or you're fired.\" It sucked, but at least you knew who the enemy was.\n\nNow, the new system is way sneakier. The main slogan has changed from \"You should\" to **\"You CAN!\"**\n\n* \"Nothing is impossible!\"\n* \"Unlock your potential!\"\n* \"Be an entrepreneur of yourself!\"\n\nThis constant pressure of \"positivity\" is the new prison. It tricks us into becoming our own slave drivers. We're not just being exploited anymore; we are actively **exploiting ourselves** in the name of \"ambition,\" \"passion,\" or \"self-improvement.\"\n\nWhen you fail or burn out, you don't blame the system. You blame *yourself*. You think, \"I just wasn't passionate enough,\" or \"I didn't manage my time well.\" It's a perfect system for keeping us isolated and blaming ourselves for problems that are 100% systemic.\n\nThis is why **\"Quiet Quitting\" isn't laziness.** It's a rebellion. It's drawing a line in the sand and refusing to be your own worst boss. It's one of the few ways left to say \"NO\" when the whole world is screaming \"YES YOU CAN!\"\n\nSo yeah, the exhaustion isn't just a personal failing. It's a feature of this entire setup.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Does it feel like you're your own worst enemy sometimes? How do we fight a system that's already inside our own heads?\n\n**TL;DR: A philosopher argues that modern society has shifted from external bosses forcing us to work, to a system of \"positivity\" and \"endless potential\" that tricks us into exploiting ourselves. Our burnout is the result of this, and quiet quitting is a logical act of rebellion against it.**",

      "selftext": "I was working a casual security job at a liquor store. One of those gigs where you’re basically a deterrent, not a hero. The rule is simple: don’t intervene, stay safe, observe, report.\n\nAnyway, I show up for my shift — no radio, no earpiece, nothing. I ask two different store staff for one, they both say I need one, but no one actually gives me a radio. So now I’m the “security guard” who can’t communicate with anyone.\n\nA little while later, two women literally walk out with bottles of alcohol. I couldn’t even warn anyone because… again, no radio.\n\nThen one of the store workers — short blonde woman, late 60s — comes over and orders me to stand directly at the main entrance. That’s the exact spot the Security company tells us not to stand because it puts us at risk if a thief decides to run or get aggressive.\n\nI explained that I’m supposed to observe from a safe position, not stand out like a human scarecrow blocking the exit. She snaps back that “the last guard got fired for refusing”. When I asked her to prove that, she immediately changed the subject. Classic intimidation move.\n\nAt this point, I’m stuck in a hostile environment with no radio, no communication, being ordered to do something unsafe by the client’s staff, and being threatened with firing if I don’t comply. I tried calling the operations line to report it, briefly got through, then the call dropped.\n\nSo I wrote a full incident report explaining everything — unsafe orders, lack of radio, attempted intimidation — and left the site.\n\nFast-forward a few days later, and I get this official letter from management accusing me of “abandoning post without approval.” Not a single line asking why. Not a single mention of my report. Just pure corporate boilerplate about “serious misconduct.”\n\nThe best part? When I said I couldn’t attend their “disciplinary meeting” on the 7th, the manager immediately replied:\n\n> “Wednesday the 8th at 1330.”\nDidn’t even ask if I was available — just assumed I’d show up.\n\n\n\nNow I’ve actually tested positive for COVID, so I emailed them saying I’ll need to postpone until I’ve recovered. You can feel the frustration radiating through the screen. They’re dying to tick their little HR boxes, and I’m just… not playing.\n\nI’m going to resign anyway, but watching them scramble to keep “process” alive while I drag my feet from has been the chef’s kiss.\n\nTL;DR: Got no radio, told to do something unsafe, wrote a report and left. Company ignored it, accused me of abandoning post, and now I’m politely delaying their disciplinary meeting while they lose their minds.",

I’m morbidly obese in the worst possible way, I’m depressed, anxious, and stressed… but hey, at least I have health insurance and retirement benefits!” — Me to my therapist, psychiatrist and a couple of co-workers\n\nLet me explain why I have said this and how it came to be:\n\nI started working for my state government in the Office of the Attorney General in August 2017 as a receptionist. At the time, I really enjoyed my work, even if I worked for a few bad apples. \n\nThat position was eliminated in 2019 due to the floor closing to the public. Because I was part of the union and paying dues, I was able to move over to the DMV in early 2020 and work as what they call an “Issuing Operator.” \n\nThen COVID happened, and I got sent home. Which was very distracting because I developed some bad habits and my ED relapsed so I was binge eating almost daily while using apps like GoPuff and Instacart, and trying to hide the evidence in my room, and in my home office. I was also easily distracted and overwhelmed by the invasion of work into my home life, and having to deal with life when I was supposed to be working. \n\nI always did better when they called me into the office and for a while after they sent me back, but I always got distracted again and would fall into bad habits. Earlier this year, I got what they call a Letter of Intent because of my gap time and internet connection issues, so I started commuting back and forth again…. And everything slowly fell apart. \n\nI had also been dealing with some medical issues over the years: anxiety, depression. I saw two different therapists, and started treatment for my eating disorder. I started seeing some doctors about weight management and was taking a number of medications for appetite suppression; one of those suppressants brought me to some dark places and I was considering suicide. I even had a plan of how to do it. I started seeing a psychiatrist after that, and they referred me to a sleep doctor and told me that I may also have ADHD along with my autism diagnosis. \n\nAnd now, this Wednesday, I got an email from IA, saying that they are investigating me because my quota is much lower compared to other people in my division and I’m supposed to see them tomorrow — Monday. So I’m pissed, anxious, fighting the urge to cut myself, and making myself sick in the process (I threw up this morning). I’ve been told it nothing to worry about but I immediately jump to the worst case scenario and don’t know how else to respond to it. \n\nSo… wish me luck I guess.",

      "selftext": "I came across an interesting argument in Julie L.

      "selftext": "So I’ve been working for this company a bit over a year now. Factory job, started in the lowest position- wasn’t bad at first until a few months in when things got dicey for management and they needed more operators. Up until this point I had been expressing interest in moving up, and they finally gave me that chance… but not really. They taught me to operate one of the fillers, which, as per the job descriptions of the company, can only be run by an operator; I learned later that they were not promoting me to an operator, instead I would only be promoted one step up. I should have left then, but I didn’t, instead I decided to stay out of the naïve hope that things would get better. A few months and mental breakdowns later there was another opportunity to move up, this time into quality. I was interviewed first and waited over two weeks for news only to be told that despite my performance, I was passed up for someone choosing to return to the position. No big deal, I got offered a position with compounding recently too as sanitation, and went to pursue that opportunity. It was a trial period, one week- at least it was supposed to be. When offered I was promised that my schedule wouldn’t change at all, but at the end I was told that there would be mandatory overtime, and was asked to think about it overnight. The very next day, still working there, one of the metal parts fell on my head and I got a concussion (yay) and was out for the rest of the week. Tomorrow would be my first day back, but as I decided the day I got a concussion, I will not be going back- I’m done. Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me, fool me a third time? I’m fucking done.",

I'm scared of the financial impact and the loss of benefits. And like I said I'm sad of losing the community I love. \n\nJust needed to vent here. ",

Ever since I was 14 and 9 months, the earliest you can possibly get a learners permit for driving in Michigan. I got a job from a family friend at a local golf course washing golf carts. Felt amazing getting my first paycheck. Like I could get anything I wanted. It was mine! \n\nLet's skip ahead a few years to present. I've had at least 10+ jobs in my life, some only lasting a few months, the longest job I held was working in two different departments in a Publix in Florida for about 5 years.\n\nI'm not entirely sure when it happened, theres a few notable instances, but over the years, working started getting harder and harder. \n\nI never went to college, felt like it was simply a waste of time and money. I have no passion, no objective, no desire to create, or really do anything. I enjoy existing regardless. I want to live. There are people I enjoy being around, games I want to play, but every day I feel like I am closer and closer to the knifes edge. \n\nJust the concept of working seems to mentally kill me. I'm currently working a job at a local Domino's back in Michigan, but between bills I have for medication, doctors, etc. I am never able to get ahead. I'm living paycheck to paycheck, day to day, only really able to buy food and other leisure purchases, because of the tips I get through delivering.\n\nI don't know what to do. I have panic attacks almost every day. I drive home almost every day literally screaming in my car. My mind is constantly full of thoughts about how to kill myself, and how I wouldn't be forced to work my entire life if I was dead. It's getting to be too much, and between my own mental problems, and the state of the world, and the amount of hate towards other people for no reason. I'm scared. And I don't know how much longer I can keep fighting, or what I'm even fighting for. \n\n\nHow do you all do it? I have a loving partner who is in no better financial state than I am, I have a loving family that's unfortunately scattered to the winds across America and Europe, but it never feels like enough, I cant stop questioning why I'm even trying to fight anymore...\n\nI just want it to end.",

      "selftext": "I’m currently working with a client who has absolutely no clarity on what they want. Every sprint, they redefine the scope, contradict previous requirements, and expect instant magic.\n\nWe’ve literally reworked the same feature around 20 times; no exaggeration. For instance, Sprint 3 completely wipes out everything we did in Sprints 1 and 2. All that work? Pointless now, because Sprint 3 introduces changes that contradict and override the earlier ones. You’d think we’re building something groundbreaking, but it’s just an inventory of a restaurant management system.\n\nThe funniest part? They talk about it as if they’re launching a rocket or discovering alien life. Meanwhile, I’m here wondering if they even have a single documented requirement that makes sense.\n\nAt this point, I just nod, laugh at them, pity them, make the changes, and send the invoice.\n\nRant over.",

We've had people leave, and had open positions in India for devs, and it's been pending for months. I can't do anything about that. BUT the client fired their own internal Product Manager. So now they are asking my CEO to have me be on-site 3 days/wk.\n\nI get paid pretty well. Not a flex, but I was happy with this job. The client's location is like 3 hours away by train, each way. It's unclear if they expect me to make a 6 HOUR ROUNDTRIP commute each day or if they'll pay for a hotel, but either way, that's bullshit. I'm genuinely considering quitting w/ no notice. I'm not doing that. My wife is pregnant and I'm not wasting most of my time for a contract that ends in January.\n\nI guess if anyone knows, would I have standing to file for unemployment in DE (Delaware in the US, not Germany) if I just quit, due to this?\n\nEdit: I am a full time employee of my company.

During this time, I’ve already noticed a few things that have been quite discouraging, such as:\n\nLong-time employees who work incorrectly or make mistakes in the process and then blame the new hires, or even other senior employees who aren’t present at the moment.\n\nThey also have a habit of threatening employees with dismissal. It’s common for them to say that there are other people ready to take our place.\n\nOn top of that, we work with public service in a small town — meaning everyone knows everyone, including the employees’ relatives. We’re often threatened with complaints made directly to managers, and sometimes people even stop them in the streets to complain.\n\nAlthough the salary is good, this constant pressure and the indirect comments are discouraging. For me, since I already have experience in other fields and I’m not a big spender, I don’t see it as worth it. I also worry that these abuses might get worse after the probation period, since, after talking to some coworkers, it seems this kind of behavior is already a common practice within the company.\n\nIn your opinion, in the long run, would it be worth staying? Or should I take advantage of the last weeks of the probation period and formally inform them that I don’t intend to continue, so I can leave with everything I’m entitled to?",

My mom is demanding that I go into work and change my availability to immediately after school so I get more shifts (despite the fact that I have a lot of homework and am taking AP classes), she also has outright said “you should work all weekends and get out of the house.” She’s also constantly telling me this, like 50% of the conversations we have are about this right now.\n\nLike come on I’m still a teenager, let me at least have some time to enjoy my life, I don’t wanna be a workaholic like them. I’m not anti work, I like working, but I’m perfectly FINE with 1 or 2 shifts a week, like ffs no one i know is even working at all, give me a damn break.\n\nI’m almost getting to a point where if she tries to make me go in and change my availability or “demand to work more” I’m just gonna go in and put in my 2 week notice.\n\nWhat do I do?

According to my partner, that guy NEVER calls in and is a really good worker. However, there's a coworker that calls in like once every few weeks? So he's kind of ruining it for everyone who needs/wants to request time off, or call in due to sickness. So that might be where it's stemming from. \n\nAnyway, my partner and I were trying to hang out on Halloween (our favorite holiday). So he requested it off, and they acted weird when he did. One of my family members is planning a big bonfire with our extended family the next day (just got the invite today), and invited my partner, as well. So now, he's afraid to request that off too, cause he doesn't want to upset the boss. Here's the thing though: he RARELY calls in or requests time off! They literally made him the lead cook recently because he's so good.\n\nBut God forbid someone gets sick, or request time off way in advance.

      "title": "Why I Quit my Retail Job Over Gum",
      "selftext": "Before my shifts I always popped a piece of gum in my mouth because it was a way of putting myself at ease in public. Being somewhat self-conscious, I was subtle about the chewing. Gum was fairly common among workers of all levels. One manager sometimes complained about it though. She was a team leader who often chewed gum herself.\n\nA year into working there, on a slow day, this Mean Manager (MM) decides that it's time for me to be written up for gum and makes one of her peers do just that. Afterwards, I confront her, saying that other people chew gum too and she even does it herself (yeah, poor arguments). She says she had a gum problem. I later realise this was a nonsensical lie.\n\nA week later, I discover that MM told an assistant manager (AM) and a colleague that I pointed out that both of them chew gum too. But this didn't happen, MM was making up petty lies. The fact that she was lying using my name left a bad taste in my mouth.\n\nFast forward six months, MM whispers something to another AM, and two seconds later he is telling me to spit my gum out while I'm in the midst of cashiering. This new manager had never acknowledged me before, yet here he was, humiliating me in front of everyone because of MM.\n\nAfter this there are other issues with MM and one day I confront her about her lies. She tells me I did bring up the AM's and colleague's names. I was confident I hadn't, I had no reason to. But she insists I did. She began saying things like, \"I swear on my granddaughter's life,\" and that's when I started doubting myself, thinking, *maybe I did say those people's names?!* She had successfully gaslighted me.\n\nA few months later, the store manager (SM) takes out some of his precious thumb-twiddling time to talk to me. The gum topic comes up, naturally. At first, I use the \"MM does it too\" argument but my shaky hands lead to anxiety being brought up and that being my reason for it. He then accepts me having gum in my mouth and discreetly chewing it, and says he'll tell MM that I have a medical condition. That same day MM threatens to send me home for chewing gum, but I tell her SM will talk to her about it.\n\nI thought I had finally won the chewing gum war. MM does bring it up again once, saying, \"About the gum, SM said you can keep it in your mouth and you're doing the opposite.\"\n\nA month later, more MM issues. I find out she is no longer managing me. I am also told - by another AM - that he's been watching me chew gum in front of customers when SM only allowed me to keep it in my mouth. Apparently, I have also been telling people that I'm allowed to chew gum and that they should do it too. These lies made as much sense as anything that MM could conjure up.\n\nAlas, I realised that I couldn't care less about the job and no longer had it within me to fight for something as insignificant as chewing gum. MM won, I lost, and I quit.",

      "selftext": "Well, I was \"temporarily\" laid off a few months ago due to the company's financial hardships. The company makes bank, but they don't manage it correctly and it caught up to them, they laid off most of the staff.\n\nThe first one to go was HR, and then, everyone else. Since the layoff deadline is coming to an end, I dug a bit and found out a few things:\n\n* HR is now ChatGPT, what could go wrong?\n* A lot of the people who were laid off were actually terminated, but they got laid off instead because the company didn't have enough money to pay for termination\n* I'm the only senior employee (+5 years of seniority) who got laid off as my department is not essential to company operations\n* I've learned I'm too expensive to keep, but also too expensive to terminate. The layoff deadline is next week and if they don't recall me they'll have to pay severance, but I've learned they'll probably call me later this week to offer my job back IN A FEW MONTHS. Technically, it'd be under a new contract so I wouldn't keep my seniority but I'm not supposed to know that. The company counts on me not pursuing severance and just considering it continued employment.\n* The company deducted vacation days I booked before being laid off, no reply when I requested them to be reinstated\n* One of my coworkers went to see an employment lawyer since things are looking grim, apparently the higher ups didn't like that and now plan to fire him, now no one talks to him or gives him hours. Management is strongly discouraging people from seeking legal advice and just asking people to \"have faith\" like they're freaking Toretto\n* The CEO got a brand new Maserati and spends twice my yearly salary in toll highway *per month*\n* The current attitude seems to be \"be grateful you still have a job,\" but since 90% of the staff got laid off, the remaining 10% are extremely overworked and of course, not getting paid extra for all the additional duties\n* Unemployment where I live is at 2008 levels, not good. I also work in a very AI affected field (think illustration, design) so it's not looking good for me.\n* Shortly before being laid off, my boss asked me if it'd be possible for me to train an AI to pilot my drone and edit my videos automatically. Outsourcing is not really an option, but I'm sure they'd look into it.\n* Clients pay for getting high quality pictures and videos of their real estate properties, I've learned the company has the receptionist trying to generate marketing videos with AI and the results are understandably horrible and clients are pissed off.\n* The poor receptionist has been tasked with training AI to make my designs, the problem is that a lot of the stuff I do is incredibly specific. For example, I make a lot of interactive documents and we all know AI is not the best with typing and following brand guidelines. So now the company is just using excel and plain work documents. This is a company that makes well over 100M a year (they're just terribly managed), and they're sending freaking plain excel sheets instead of a proper catalog of the products.\n\nI could go on and on. I feel bad for my coworkers because they're good people. I'm in a good position and I can afford to do my own thing, but some of them NEED the job to stay in the country. It's not that \"no one wants to work,\" we just don't want to work with the shitty conditions those companies offer..!",

      "selftext": "Finally landed a great job that actually seems to care about their employees and pays decently. So I gave my two weeks’ notice at my current job (Market 32) to leave on good terms. Instead of handling it professionally, my manager cut all my shifts except one out of spite. I literally did what I was supposed to do by formally quitting.\n\nThis place has been a nightmare. Management is petty and retaliatory, the pay is garbage, and if you’re part-time there are zero benefits. They treat workers like disposable objects. On top of that, there’s blatant transphobia, constant misgendering, and open discrimination toward autistic employees.\n\nI’ve worked there almost 3 years, always reliable, always on time. I’ve numerously cleaned shit and piss stains off the bathroom floor, dealt with rude customers who commented on my appearance, and managed to keep things looking great even on the busiest days. Everyone here in maintenance are all men, but once my manager found out I was trans, she started misgendering me and \"forgetting\" my pronouns lmao.\n\nI’m done. I’m no call/no showing that last shift, because I’ve already moved on. Goodbye Market 32, and fuck you Judy. I wish I could do something even more petty but I honestly don't care. I should have just quit on the spot.\n\nI’m only 18, and I feel very proud I forced myself to apply to jobs out of my comfort zone, even when it felt impossible. There are always better options out there, you just have to keep looking. I had no idea what I was doing but I've now found a job that pays 22 an hour. Just wanted to rant, I know a lot of places are like this but that shouldn't be the case. Any time me or my coworkers would take a day off, even if it was months away, they would do shit like not schedule us for a week. Makes no sense to me, I'm ecstatic to leave.\nOnly thing that sucks is I was kind of relying on those two more paychecks before I leave. I can't start at my other job for a few weeks so I'm going to have to pull out of savings.",

      "selftext": "Hi Reddit. \n\nDutch guy here. Some (maybe a lot) context; I work at a higher professional education (HBO) level, but I don’t have an HBO diploma, and I’ve been working for about 10 years now in commercial office environments. I’ve always held a leadership position there (think teams ranging from 3 to 25 people). I’ve done this at several companies: started at a start-up, moved on to an SME, and now I’m at a multinational. I’ve been given great opportunities and made use of them. For a while, it felt like the dream. But—\n\nThe problem: In all of these jobs, I’ve felt the same emptiness, and I’ve been losing a lot of motivation and zest for life.\n\nI’m (if I may say so myself, but I also hear this from others) good at what I do. I pick things up quickly and can often deliver the same quality on projects in much less time than my colleagues seem to need.\n\nFrom this, two pain points arise: I’ve tried to take on more work than my colleagues because apparently, I can. But it costs me a lot of energy, and I don’t feel the compensation or recognition balances it out, even if it could. So that frustrates me. On the flip side, where I am now, I do the minimum required work in the shortest time possible and take it easier otherwise. This leads to procrastination, loss of motivation, and more frustration.\n\nI haven’t seen the point in it for a long time, and on top of that, I’m completely fed up with these dull offices. Sure, I get work done and I’m paid well. But just the thought of having to keep doing this for decades makes me feel depressed.\n\nI’m considering another job. But with no formal degree and only “HBO-level work and thinking experience,” I keep finding myself coming back to similar positions in my search. I’m willing to take a pay cut. There must be a decent job out there, say, around an average salary, that isn’t completely soul-crushing in a soul-crushing environment?\n\nHas anyone escaped this feeling/this situation? Or does anyone have a golden tip on how to enjoy what apparently is “the standard”?",

I didn’t want to find out afterward, I wanted to go out on my own terms and that’s exactly I did.\n\nI came prepared. I brought copies of my resume and gave full, detailed answers throughout the interview. I wasn’t passive or checked out. I treated it with the same level of commitment I’ve always brought to the job. I’ve been pushing for this since August of last year, and I always I showed up early, I stayed late, I always gave 100%. I took pride in the work, I essentially tried to be the physical embodiment of what a properly loaded van should look like. I don’t think anyone who’s worked around me would disagree.\n\nWhen they asked if I had any questions at the end, I said no, but I did have something that I wanted to leave them with. I pulled out my folder and handed them my formal resignation letter. \n\nThen I explained why. I told them I’ve given more than I could afford to give physically, mentally, and emotionally, just trying to prove I belonged here. I said it’s crazy how you can want something for so long, but the moment it’s finally within reach, you start to realize the damage it caused to chase it. That at a certain point, loyalty starts turns into self-betrayal. And that’s the point where I was at, accepting this promotion would’ve felt like self-betrayal to me. \n\nI told them this decision was the only one that felt like it respected everything I had already put in. That I wasn’t angry or bitter. I understood the process. I didn’t hold anything against them personally. but I just couldn’t keep giving like this with no return. I said I knew I was only being seriously considered now because people knew I was on the way out, and even they nodded in agreement when I brought up how I should’ve gotten the role back in May.  \n\nThey asked what was next, and I told them I have another job lined up as a behavioral health technician. I’m working on my master’s and need 600 supervised hours to graduate. My plan is to finish in a year and a half instead of two years. They were surprised to hear I’m only 22. I made sure to let them know this wasn’t me burning a bridge, but to me, this was closure. And I said that I wanted the door to remain open in case there’s a path back in the future.\n\nWe shook hands. One of them said, “It’s been real,” and the other said they appreciated me even if their time with me there was short. I said I appreciated them too. I told them that this wasn’t easy, I was up until 3 AM writing that letter, and I won’t lie, I cried while doing it. I told them that I enjoyed the grind, I just hate what it ended up costing me in the end. \n\nI didn’t quit because I hated the job. I liked the job and I liked the people. But I couldn’t keep breaking myself for something that wouldn’t even meet me halfway. It still hurts, But I know I left with my head up. I know I meant what I said. I know it was the right call for me.",

I put in my clock out code at the office and then requested a shift adjustment on the app for the extra 2 hours that I worked. At first they approved it but then once it came close to payment time all of a sudden they disapproved it and only paid me for the hours I was scheduled! \n\nAt happy returns I worked a shift there but then realizing that I lost my phone while on break I started to look for my phone like anybody would do, when they realized I was looking for my phone they sent me home for being \"not productive\" is what one of the bosses claimed \n\nWhen I explained to him that I can't clock out on the app unless I find my phone he got irritated and sent me home.\n\nI went home later that day I saw that my shift I just worked for got marked down as \"canceled\" and all of my other shifts with them were marked down as canceled I then requested for the 5 and a half hours that I just worked for in the app and once again got approved and then approaching payday didn't get paid. Only this time instead of disapproving my hours they just kept adjusting my hours less and less until eventually there was nothing. Not only did they do that but on top of that they then dropped my rating from a 5 star rating to a 1 star rating! Fuck those guys! \n\nIf you can think of any other companies that goes out of their way to not pay you correctly on instawork please comment them and I'll add them to the list!!",

He quit because the company passed him up for a promotion (he'd still be my boss, but more power and money). The person who replaced him was an absolute neglectful cock who straight up told me to never talk to her, and to send my complaints to the supervisor (who was above me but below her). \n\nOn top of him leaving, he sent out an email saying the company is testing out a new system which takes a main perk away. \n\nI fucking hate corporations and companies.

And I said im not a full time employee and that policy doesnt apply. But I needed the job and accepted. The main reason for the hybrid role was because I live on the other end of town. My commute is minimum 45min (approximately +35 miles) each way. Unless I take tolls or express lanes to get that down to about 36min (and $30/day which is not reimbursed)..\n\nThey expressed the desire to roll me over to full time and assured me that my commute would be factored into an equitable arrangement. \n\nFast forward, they offered me the high end of the salarh range, and in my eagerness and naivety. I accepted. \n\nThe last few days have been an insanely stressful back and forth with my boss about how my performance the past year demonstrates that 3 days in office works. And I've been willing to show up more if needed. \n\nI am requesting something that is in line with their work policy (this is what the policy is for), and at first, the boss wouldn't budge.

Most engineering companies still have these arrangements available. \nIt's simply daunting to consider spending +6k a year on tolls. And worse.. nearly 8h a week driving. \n\nIts a good salary and good benefits but fuck. Idk what to do. \nI fucked up and should've clarified things early on. \nNegotiated reimbursement or locked in a hybrid arrangement. \n\nEh. \n",

Basically you just speak to clients and give them the rundown on their policies and answer any questions they have. Very simple. I initially turned down the offer after my second interview because it was either pay for the cost of the license ($149) or feed myself and my cat for the rest of the week. I chose to live another week so I thanked them for the offer but declined. A couple of days later I get a text from the hiring director who did my second interview and he basically said we’ll offer you a discount (I only paid $75) on buying the coursework for your license and I agreed and bought it. Fast forward not even 4 days, I FINALLY receive an email from some man who’s supposed to be the manager of me and the team I’ve been assigned to and it’s about training and onboarding. At the end of the email it states “if you have any questions or concerns please do not hesitate to reach out” so I did just that. I emailed him back in a reply saying I would not be able to attend the Friday zoom meeting seeing as though I am a college student (which was included in my application+resume and I also brought it up in my second interview) and there are test(s) I can not miss nor reschedule, will I be able to attend another day earlier in the week? No response. So I text the number of one of the clerks I was given to tell her my concern. The same thing I stated in the email to my manager I sent her. Not sure she even read my text message completely but she just “Hi, please reach out to your manager directly. Thank you.” I didn’t even bother responding to that but I sent ANOTHER email to that manager and he still has not replied. I’m giving them until Friday morning. I have no energy and no patience to keep reaching out to managers that don’t bother checking their emails or messages. I’m almost completely finished with the coursework and then I just have to apply for the proctored state testing for it. It just all feels like a waste of time.

On one hand I’m happy I’m working the amount of hours I asked for, but on the other I’d be making way more money at even McDonald’s if the one near me was hiring.\n\nMy question is if these are somewhat reasonable conditions to work by, or if this is abnormal, since getting a job is nearly impossible these days. I’m also wondering if I have any kind of case since I’m only making like a hundred something bucks a week.",

As usual some of the people who get targeted are the most experienced and of course, more highly paid of the bunch. I've heard some were told earlier in the year, \"I'm sorry but we can't give you a raise because you already make too much.\". Meanwhile CEOs have UNLIMITED upside for their pay but are always the ones who get to stick around. \n\nImagine how many jobs a CEO could save by simply saying, \"You know what? I actually have more than enough money for this year. Use my pay to shore up these jobs and we'll look for other ways to weather this storm.\" Instead, it's \"Fuck you, got mine!\". I know people who purposefully do not ask for an increase in wages or rank simply to keep from being one of the ones on the chopping block at any given point. Think what that says about the kind of society we now live in where you have to calculate how little can you get by on just on the off chance you can skirt by a firing, just for being cheap and easy to keep?\n\nIt is a sick, sick profit driven world we live in and I feel for all these people who now have to look for work in one of the worst job markets we've ever had. Every job gets 100's of applications, most of which never get looked at. Half the postings are fictitious just to make it seem the company has a dynamic work force and are always looking for new talent. Meanwhile they either hire from within or simply say, \"Oh we eliminated that position actually.\", after you waited a month to see if they were interested in hiring you.

They're also splitting our 40-hour weeks across 6 days instead of 5 to avoid consecutive extended shifts.\n\nWhen someone pointed out this is literally illegal, our manager said, \"Corporate legal found a loophole in how our employment contracts are structured. It's all above board.\"\n\nThe kicker? They presented this as a \"benefit\" because we'll \"have more hours available\" to earn money. Yeah, at regular pay rates instead of overtime.\n\nI've already updated my resume and have two interviews lined up. Funny how companies cry about \"nobody wants to work\" but then pull stunts like this.\n\nKnow your rights, folks.

I’m an evening/closing person mainly, often tasked with cleaning and stocking up the bathrooms. \n\nWithin the months I’ve been at this job a potentially distressing pattern has emerged. It started with the women’s sink faucet. It sat for months unfixed, with a hand sanitizer bottle offered as an alternative. Meanwhile the men’s bathroom was completely fine. Come to think of it, the faucet had sat there broken for far longer than it’s worked during my 6 months there so far. It works now but…\n\nRecently though, we’ve completely ran out of Toilet paper. We actually don’t have an “employee only” bathroom, instead employees must use the same bathrooms our customers use. Granted management has tried to tide us/them over with facial tissue, but the lack of initiative to order more is a health hazard waiting to happen, especially on the women’s side. I for one am practically forced to invest in my own supply for work just so I can have it for when my cycle inevitably hits.\n\nI don’t know if it’s a supply chain issue, or management simply doesn’t care, but the lack of alarm from my coworkers is deeply disturbing. The situation is unsanitary, and that’s not counting blood waste. I’m not sure if bathrooms open to customers is grounds for reporting to OSHA but I’d think if there are no employee only bathrooms that it’s a violation?? I don’t know I haven’t experienced this before.\n\nAt the very least <Company> isn’t fixing things as soon as they break. Our drinking fountain has been leaking for weeks, our front doors have needed to be repaired multiple times. Sink issue, no paper towels to clean with or wipe hands, no toilet paper. We technically don‘t have soap supplied by the company, instead it’s bar soap that an employee went out and bought for the store.\n\nI’m still employed there with no job lined up currently, or else I’d name drop them. It seems more like it’s more the company rather than the location?? Idk. Should I report them to OSHA?\n\nEDIT!!: I made this post at like 4 in the morning when I was on an anxiety bender. Now that I have my brain screwed in properly I can give a disclaimer that based on the pattern on even stuff I haven’t said in this post body, it’s not management. Management has been trying to make do with what <company> sends for the last few months. It’s <company> that isn’t responding to requests to fix various problems throughout the store. It’s management that’s buying soap out of their own pockets. I probably shouldn’t report them to OSHA because it could cause problems for our GM, who’s actually trying his best to give us everything we need. Like they need a fall guy or some shit idk. \n",

Last night was the nail in the coffin for me, being harped on for my attendance when I hadn’t legitimately called out in over 7 months. \n\nAfter weeks of being understaffed because so many people had quit in August — and working doubles and overtime — I got sick. I ended up with a severe case of pneumonia that required IV antibiotics. I was out for four days. On two of those days, I even tried coming in, but I was sent home because I couldn’t breathe and looked pale. I work at a hospital. The charge nurses told me to go straight back to the ER, and sure enough, it had gotten worse and I needed IV treatment — all because I was scared of getting fired.\n\nThey rolled out a brand new point system. We only get eight points in a six-month period, which might be fine, except they specifically said doctor’s notes and hospital stays don’t excuse absences at all. A colleague of mine was fired just last month for being hospitalized with sepsis — they wouldn’t even accept her doctor’s notes — so naturally I was terrified. Each call-out is two points. Not to mention, they also ding us for clocking in early, clocking out late, taking too short of a break, or being just one minute late.\n\nThe odds were stacked against me, especially when they told us the policy had actually gone into effect in June but they didn’t bother to announce it until September. They said they’d be adding up all the old points retroactively. By then, I was sure I already had more than eight, just from skipping breaks due to short staffing or clocking out late — things you’d think they’d want from employees. But nope.\n\nThis past week had been eating me alive with anxiety. I quit before they could fire me. Just being out with pneumonia would have been eight points by itself. It’s 2 points everyday you are out. I came in to work when my dad died, when my kid was in the hospital, after I got out of the hospital all to avoid this bullshit but it doesn’t matter. Even when I myself was walking in with a ox sat of 77 \n4 months pregnant.\n\nI’m scared about the future because the job market is terrible, but I also know there has to be something better out there.\n\nI hate this society and this work culture. It shouldn’t be like this ever. ",

      "selftext": "I hate work. Not my specific job, but the very idea of wage labor itself. The mere fact that you have to give away a third of your life just to avoid starving to death and to secure the bare minimum of necessities drives me into a catatonic stupor. Of course, another third of life is spent on recharging the brain and body, but at least that part has some compensation — dreams, whether good or bad. So, after subtracting work and an average of 8 hours of sleep, you’re left with 8 hours of your own time. With an average lifespan of 60 years, in reality, a person truly lives (not just exists) for only 20 years. And that alone is a heavy reason to reflect on the futility of existence.\n\nIt is very rare for someone to make a living doing what they truly love. I don’t count famous musicians, movie stars, heirs of family businesses, etc., since they make up less than 1% of the population. In most cases, people simply step over themselves and switch off the \"awareness block\" of their condition. I, having changed more than one job, realized that I don’t and never will have a job that I like. I don’t enjoy loading, digging, hauling crap — monotonous physical labor. The very idea of smiling at customers while trying to sell them some bullshit, or jumping through managerial hoops for a bonus makes me sick. Sitting in an office and slowly rotting away while pretending to be busy and listening to the absolutely uninteresting chatter of 45–50-year-old women disgusts me. I’m tired of supervising and managing drunken working-class idiots, who probably share my thoughts about work anyway. Even remote work disgusts me; freelancing feels repulsive. It’s constant stress. In the end, I don’t want to be a worker, a manager, a boss, or a freelancer. The only things left are creativity and hobbies. And here I’m strongly against turning the things I love into a source of income — I’ve burned myself on that once already. It’s a truly awful feeling when something you used to love and could do for hours becomes a prison sentence.\n\nSo, the only acceptable model of existence for me is parasitism. I’ve honestly admitted to myself: I want to do absolutely nothing, put in no effort — or the bare minimum — and still have everything I need for life. To become a rentier, rent out five apartments, and just collect coupons from society. But I’m broke, I have no wealthy relatives or real estate — and I never will. And so once again I’ll have to slave away just to buy a bowl of soup. For all eternity, until the end of time, I am doomed to work. I am doomed to be a slave.",

One of my coworkers brought it up in a group chat with the other two servers, confronted the owner who then showed him how she did the tipout (with herself and her husband, the other owner, both getting the largest proportions of the tips), and then we all quit lol and said we were gonna report it to the dept of labor, but I’m pretty sure I’m the only one who actually did. \n\nWhen I made my report, which included a photo of how the owners were distributing tips as my proof, the DoL basically said we’ll review it but it could take months/years and I had kind of forgotten about it (as this was ~2years ago)… until I got an email the other day saying I have zoom court with them in a month!! \n\nif this was a corporate place I’d happily get all I could out of them… but it’s a small, family-owned local spot, and I don’t want them to go out of business or anything, just to pay their employees fairly!! they also have an adult daughter who is special needs and needs to have support/an aide who works with her, and wouldn’t want to jeopardize their ability to take care of her. however, while they’d constantly tell us the restaurant was just scraping by, they’d also be showing me pictures of the bathroom they’d just had remodeled, or their patio they just had re-done, which (especially where we live) is thousands of dollars of labor/materials…\n\nanyway, any tips on how to handle this cordially and still get what I’m owed, without completely destroying their livelihood? what should I expect to do in zoom court? \n\nETA: already feeling better from the replies. thanks y’all.

      "selftext": "I have read many thread about current layoff of white collar jobs and high earner. six-figure tech workers or management finally feeling pain, suddenly calling for unity. But where was that unity when factories in the Midwest shut down, when retail workers or any low pay job couldn’t afford rent, when blue collar jobs got outsourced? When we introduce gig workers??\n\nWe’ve built a system where CEOs make absurd multiples while normal workers can’t buy a house. A janitor in the 60s could afford a home and raise a family. Now? Even two parents working full-time struggle. That wasn’t magic anyway… that was policy. Back then, the richest , also the one earning the equivalent of today 6 figure, were taxed 70–90%. We chose fairness.\n\nAnd here’s the paradox: today it’s the Republican Party and this clown of Trump pushing tariffs and protectionism, that is normally stuff usually associated with the left. Meanwhile, Democrats ignored Sanders, no primaries and stuck to donor-friendly incrementalism. The end result was that the “party of labor” forgot labor.\n\nLook at China, or even Brazil: not perfect systems, but they understand tariffs, state-led planning, and protecting their markets. The US once did the same after WWII. That’s what built the middle class. Hyper-capitalism tore it apart.\n\nSo no I’m sorry but six-figure earners aren’t the main victims here. They just feel it now. The real crisis is decades of policy that let corporations run free, hollowed out communities, and pushed inequality off the charts.\n\nWe don’t need hand-wringing. We need serious action: higher taxes on wealth, state-led investment in industries, socialism , stronger unions, and an end to corporate capture. Call it populism, call it fairness, call it survival. But stop pretending this “market knows best” thing works\nit doesn’t",

      "selftext": "There's this guy I work with let's call him Derek who has started bringing our manager coffee and a sandwich every single morning. Like clockwork. 9am, there he is at her desk with a latte and some overpriced breakfast sandwich from the cafe downstairs. And she just eats it up (literally and figuratively). The thing that's really getting under my skin is that Derek is, objectively, not great at his job. He misses deadlines constantly, half-asses his reports, and the rest of us end up picking up his slack. I've had to redo his work more times than I can count. But now he's suddenly besties with the boss because of some breakfast sandwiches? I was playing jackpot city last night trying to decompress, and I just kept thinking about how unfair this whole situation is. Like, I actually do my job well. I meet my deadlines, I help other people on the team, I don't cause problems. But I'm not out here buying my way into someone's good graces.\n\nAnd here's what really worries me: there's a promotion coming up in the next couple months. If Derek gets it because he's been sucking up with his little breakfast routine, I'm going to lose it. This dude doesn't deserve a promotion. He deserves a performance review.\n\nI know office politics are a thing and schmoozing matters, but this feels so blatant and gross. Am I overreacting? Should I start bringing her breakfast too? (I really don't want to stoop to that level.) Or do I just accept that hard work doesn't actually matter as much as knowing how to kiss ass?\n\nHas anyone else dealt with this kind of thing? How do you not let it drive you completely crazy?",

Will they still submit my resume just to make numbers? Do they get paid by how far they can drag you down the funnel or by the number of resumes they collect?\n\nEdited: This frustrates me for two reasons. Like fake job postings, it's a waste of my time. Second, and more importantly, there are a lot of people actively looking for a job. It makes a lot more sense to work with one of them than to try to trick someone who has a job into applying for something less desirable than their current circumstances. ",

His old team jumped ship 3 years ago, after training him. The pay was comfortable, and my husband’s immediate supervisor was a great woman, who went to bat for the team again and again. With the WFH benefits, my husband decided to stay. He was happy, why leave?\n\nWell, now he has no choice. About 6 months ago, they hired a bitch who has been bullying him the likes of which makes my blood boil. I love my husband. I love him greater than anyone I have ever met on this miserable planet. He is a great source of comfort to me. And he is hurting.\n\nHis supervisor seems to have her hands tied. She acknowledges this whole thing is stupid, and can likely see the end result. She has actually taken steps to mitigate the damage this woman is trying to do to my husband.\n\nI want blood, but I know that is unreasonable. But Im not gonna take this lying down. I won’t tolerate a pair of boobs levying her power over men to make my darling husband look like a creep. He can’t say two words without her crying about it. It’s gotten to the point where he is afraid to talk to anyone whenever he goes into the office. No joke: his actual written pre-pip notice says he has been too nice AND too rude. If he talks about what’s going on to other coworkers, he gets pulled aside the next day for “going on a witch hunt”. One of his old coworkers is offering him a position with better pay away from all this. As soon as my love is safe, I want to send a message to this bitch. She wants a witch hunt? I’ll give her a witch hunt. Let’s see how well she cries “sexist” when the person pressing charges against her is another woman.\n\nHow do I go about this in a legal way, that won’t backfire on my husband and encourages the witch to seek therapy for her victims complex? I don’t want to destroy her. But I also don’t want her to continue torturing souls as pure as my husbands. Thoughts?",

I knew even some of my work was coming out shitty but passable by bare minimum, yet still worried me that someone might say something if they paid close enough attention. I even had to use 15 hours for mental health because one shift lead loves to bully people when he has it bad and unfortunate last month, I was the target of such. But it seems like no matter what, he doesn't get punished for it, considering he's been there for 6 years now.\n\nHow would I go about filling this out to ensure I could get accommodations for mental health leave forgiveness using Sick Time Off so I can save the hours for physical illnesses?

      "selftext": "Hi, I am new here. I have been working a lot of corporate jobs, in the city, making a switch to less conventional work has been near impossible. Anyways. Often times, the things that workplaces expect out of the Ideal Employee make me feel I am betraying myself. Make me feel that I am betraying others. They expect me to just be quiet and stay out of it when my co-workers are dealing with any sort of behavior from customers. They expect us to drain every dime from our customers even when it doesn't make sense. They want us to conform, fall in line, do what we're told, and not just keep our opinions to ourselves, but to entirely align them with the company opinions. They even go as far as using studied cult tactics to control us because they're effective and it's just business.\n\nThe most frustrating part of this is that when you are interviewing for a position, they WANT a person. They don't want just another cog in the machine. They want you to have hobbies, to do things in your free time and be able to talk about it, and if you say, \"I spend most of my time sleeping or working,\" it's a red flag, so you can't say that, but it's hard to feel that you have the time to do much more than that, when I am at the top of my timebudgeting I still only have the time to catch up on the week's home chores. So you just have to talk about the hobbies you'd like to be doing or that you used to do and hope they don't catch on to that you don't actually have the time to do them. They want you to be interesting and genuine for the interview-- then after wards that gets punished. But hopping jobs without another one set up is especially reckless these days, so I don't have time to become a person again before getting to the next job, because getting to the next job feels like my only out.\n\nTLDR; tired of not feeling like a whole person, not knowing how to answer, \"what are your hobbies?\" in a way that feels in any capacity genuine. Also facing corporate fatigue + interview fatigue.",

It wouldn't have really made a difference if the kitchen was properly staffed though, because they often cut corners to be the best in the district. Mon-Thurs mornings, two cooks are expected to work three stations by themselves each. Open, work three stations by yourself, and also manage to get extra prep work done that was REQUIRED. If you wanted to go home on time, you had to do it in-between making food. I always told myself I could do it and I could get through it, but I really started to falter. My performance went down and so did my ability to be kind.   \n  \nI had to go out of work for mental health and hospitalization, and decided to take some more time once I was out, and asked to be put on medical leave. As time passed and I felt less and less inclined to fill out the packet, and eventually just came to the decision that I was going to quit, and look for WFH jobs. \n\nI found what I needed, and headed to go quit in person so I could say goodbye to some people, and I ended up hanging out with one coworker after he had got off. I told him to catch me up on all that I missed because at that point I was out of the job for almost a month. \n\nAs he began to explain new menu roll outs, new rules, and how the managers had only gotten worse since I left, I genuinely felt panic and dread began to build up in my throat. Just hearing about my old job was enough to put myself back into the headspace I was always in when I worked there. I hadn't realized how much my 20 HOUR A WEEK job was destroying my mental health and my physical self until I had finally made it out. I can't imagine ever going back to that job, which is so insane to me because I remember feeling like I was never going to get out of that place. Like I was trapped there forever. These places really do induce helplessness in you and keep you there. For what? Certainly not the paycheck. ",

      "selftext": "After weeks of sustained posting and direct tagging - and despite their aggressive legal action in other matters - neither Cornbread Hemp nor any associated entity has sent me a Cease and Desist (C&D) letter or filed a defamation lawsuit.\n\nThis is a profound admission. If my claims of a pretextual firing (following a \"rock star\" review) and direct retaliation (proven by a smoking gun audio recording) were false, their (already retained) legal team would have acted immediately. Their inaction is driven by a fear of legal discovery, which would force their internal emails and Slack messages into the public record.\n\nThe hubris is the final, unanswerable challenge: Cornbread Hemp has the resources, the motivation, and the legal infrastructure to sue the state of Tennessee, but they cannot manage to counter my documented claims.\n\n—\n\nI never wanted this fight to be public. I tried everything to handle it quietly: I asked for help, I gave them every off-ramp, I  spent months trying to find attorneys who could intervene before it got this far. I was patient, careful, and kept giving Cornbread chances to do the right thing.\n\nInstead, they doubled down.\n\nI worked at Cornbread Hemp earlier this year. In 90 days I built their Customer Experience department from scratch, created growth paths, retrained the CX team, and even fixed their broken AI Agent that had been failing for months. My work saved them money, improved performance, and got them public praise.\n\nThen my pre-existing health conditions (which I had disclosed during hiring) flared up. I didn’t even ask for an accommodation - I just tried to use my **earned PTO after my 90-day probationary period.** Instead, I was told I *had* to go through the ADA process. I followed every step: submitted medical paperwork, HIPAA releases, everything. Their response?\n\n* **Direct retaliation, caught on tape:** My manager told my team I was locked out of my systems “because of ADA stuff” and because I mentioned bringing in legal help. I only found this out when the transcript was emailed to my work email (the one account they forgot to lock).\n* **Constructive discharge:** While I was still on payroll, they hired my replacement. I got emails in my inbox from an external account manager welcoming her and updating the calendar invite.\n* **Wrongful termination:** The same day I notified their attorney that I’d filed an EEOC charge, their lawyer emailed me saying my employment was terminated.\n\nAnd the kicker? At the same time they were blocking my access, my boss was out giving interviews and putting her name on the AI work I did. Gorgias (our Support/CX platform) literally featured her in an e-book.\n\nMeanwhile Cornbread Hemp is all over LinkedIn begging people to “speak up” for the future of hemp, claiming to care about integrity and wellness, and touting a new partnership with University of Louisville Athletics. But when an actual employee used her basic rights, they erased me and retaliated. I even warned UofL about the risk weeks before the announcement. They ignored me.\n\nI didn’t go public out of choice: I went public because they left me no other option. I’ve already filed with the EEOC and documented everything.\n\nThis is what corporate hypocrisy looks like: profits and PR first, people last.\n\n**Receipts:**\n\n* My LinkedIn activity documenting the retaliation and termination - [https://www.linkedin.com/in/gracemckamey/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gracemckamey/)\n* A Google Takeout full of timestamped, contemporaneous documentation\n* Audio recording of my manager admitting retaliation\n\nThey’re growing and hiring, so beware.\n\n**EDIT - what I’ve already tried:**\n\n* Hired two employment attorneys - one told me to take 6 weeks severance, the other told Cornbread I resigned without ever speaking to me.\n* Contacted dozens of employment law firms, both local and national.\n* Reached out to disability rights organizations at the state and national level.\n* Sent complaints to state regulators and federal oversight bodies.\n* Contacted workers’ rights nonprofits and advocacy groups.\n\nNo one would take my case and some said their insurance wouldn’t cover them working with me. After months of being stonewalled, going public is my last resort.\n\n**EDIT 2 (BOO LINKEDIN BLOCKING PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE ACCOUNTS FROM SEEING POSTS):**\n\nThis is what I have a recording of my manager saying to my direct report:\n\n*\"Also, before we hop—I’ll let you go—but we removed Grace. Just her access from everything today. Just full transparency into what is going on.*\n\n*I don’t know if you’ve talked to her or not, but there’s just some back and forth with her timeout and some ADA stuff, and she is saying that she’s about to bring in a legal group. So we—yeah—we removed access so that way she doesn’t get into everything and just mess anything up.*\n\n*So just let me know if there’s any repercussions. There shouldn’t be. But if anybody says anything or—you know—I know that she’s friends with REDACTED, so that’s something I’m kind of keeping a close eye on, especially with these ticket counts.*\n\n*Just want you to be in the loop. This is not common knowledge—just between us—but that’s kind of what’s going on. And you’ll just notice that she’s not on Slack or anything anymore.*\n\n*Yeah. Which might be a big thing, unfortunately. But we’ll cross that bridge if it comes. So. Yeah, it’s fun over here.\"*\n\n**EDIT 3:** I have presented webinars that provide SHRM credit for HRCI and HR.com. I am fully aware of the consequences of my campaign and will no longer be working in any type of corporate industry, which is why I am speaking out. My only goal is to make it uncomfortable for this company to ever treat any other disabled person like this.\n\n**TIMELINE:**  \nI asked to use earned PTO beginning on May 13.  \nHR said no, I had to submit ADA accommodation paperwork.  \nI tried to do that. They wouldn't take it and refused to communicate with my provider, even when I provided a HIPAA release.  \nI expressed concerns about how they were handling this matter and the legality surrounding it, as I had previously worked extensively in HR tech.  \nThey cut access on May 30, citing my legal concerns. I was not informed of this directly, I found out via the meeting transcript being sent to me accidentally.  \nI did not have a lawyer for weeks after May 30. I did not have a lawyer for a week+ after May 30. I retained my first attorney on June 9.  \nMy replacement's start date was July 14.  \nI was not terminated until July 23.\n\nTo clarify: I was never against the ADA process. I thought it was inappropriate and concerning to force it during an employee's medically documented physical and mental health crisis for 8 total days of leave. Especially when the employee in question had a strong performance documented the week prior and available PTO.\n\n**IMPORTANT UPDATE: I posted my story in** r/Louisville **and the number of cruel comments is, objectively, shocking. Someone even commented #TeamEricandJimmy (the names of the co-founders).**  \n[**https://www.reddit.com/r/Louisville/comments/1ntq3i7/local\\_hemp\\_company\\_retaliated\\_against\\_me\\_for/**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Louisville/comments/1ntq3i7/local_hemp_company_retaliated_against_me_for/)\n\n**EDIT 4:** I've reviewed the transcript of my 90-day review with my manager that was delivered to me on May 12, one day before this conflict began.\n\nMy manager called me a \"complete rock star\" and told me, \"You have done exactly what, like, I was really looking for in this role, and I was really scared I wasn't going to find.\" She credited me with having \"rebuilt Al agent\", implemented SOPs , onboarded new agents, and optimized our metrics. She stated that I  \"brought a lot of stability and momentum to cx\".\n\nThe single piece of constructive feedback I received was to \"slow down a little bit\"  because I was moving so quickly. Her exact words were, \"You are accomplishing so much in a short amount of time, and the impact around that has been so positive and so obvious, but sometimes I think we are moving a little bit too fast.\"\n\n**FINAL EDIT** \\- **Here. Receipts.** **I'm getting tired of defending myself, honestly. Before anyone else brings in another red herring, my leave was extended due to the sheer stress from this situation and the death of my husband's father from terminal cancer on June 1. Also I edited the headers of the emails to (obviously) redact and because my comment wasn't posting and I was afraid it was formatting but it was length so I broke it into two comments.**\n\nGrace Clements <REDACTED> Fri, Jun 6, 2025 at 5:28 PM\n\nTo - Jesse Pavlovic <REDACTED>\n\nCc - Katherine Goodman <REDACTED>, Grace Clements <REDACTED>, Eric Zipperle <REDACTED>\n\nHi Jesse,\n\nThis is my fourth written request following the submission of my provider’s return-to-work documentation confirming a qualifying disability and a projected return date\n\nof June 17. As of today, June 6, I have not received confirmation of receipt from anyone at Cornbread Hemp.\n\nPer my attorney’s guidance, I am now explicitly reiterating that my leave through June 17 is being taken as a reasonable accommodation under the ADA, tied to a documented disability. This accommodation request, and the supporting paperwork, were submitted in good faith and in full compliance with the interactive process as initiated by your team.\n\nPlease confirm in writing that:\n\n1. You have received my documentation,\n2. My leave through June 17 is recognized as ADA-qualifying,\n3. No disciplinary action will be taken during this protected period.\n\nIf further clarification is needed from my provider, please let me know and I will coordinate accordingly. I remain under active medical care, and I continue to cooperate in full.\n\nOn Thu, Jun 5, 2025...\n\nJesse,\n\nFollowing up on my recent messages, I’ve now received my provider’s return-to-work documentation, which confirms a return date of June 17, 2025. I’ve attached\n\nthe letter here for your records.\n\nPlease confirm receipt and let me know if anything further is needed on your end.\n\nOn Thu, Jun 5, 2025...\n\nJesse,\n\nI am following up on my message from earlier this week regarding my ongoing medical care and anticipated return date of on or around June 17. I wanted to reconfirm that my provider’s return-to-work note is still pending and should be available soon.\n\nPlease confirm receipt.\n\nOn Tue, Jun 3, 2025...\n\nJesse,\n\nI wanted to provide a brief update regarding my current status under the ADA interactive process.\n\nPending final documentation and medical clearance from my providers, my anticipated return-to-work date is on or around June 17, 2025. This estimate is\n\nbased on my current progress and communication with my care team, but remains subject to medical confirmation. I will follow up with finalized documentation as soon as it becomes available.\n\nPlease let me know if there are any additional steps required from my end in the meantime. I remain committed to cooperating in good faith throughout this process.\n\nOn Tue, Jun 3, 2025...\n\nGrace,\n\nThanks for sharing the form.\n\nPlease let us know by the end of the week what you and your provider decide and whether there are any other specific accommodations we need to consider.\n\nThanks,\n\nOn Mon, Jun 2, 2025 at 9:33PM...\n\nHi Jesse,\n\nI’ve uploaded the completed ADA documentation from my provider to the shared Google Drive folder as requested.\n\nAt this time, I’m actively working with my provider to obtain the additional clarification regarding a return-to-work date. I’ll forward that update as soon as it becomes available.\n\nPlease let me know if anything else is needed in the meantime.\n\nOn Mon, Jun 2, 2025 at 4:50PM Jesse Pavlovic <REDACTED> wrote:\n\nHello,\n\nI spoke with your provider REDACTED, as noted on your release form, not the provider who filled out the original ADA form, and shared the documentation requested.\n\nYou can use the same folder link you used previously to submit documentation.\n\nI’m sorry to hear of the death of your family member *\\[my husband's father died of cancer on June 1\\]*. Thanks for the heads up on the Gusto request.",

      "selftext": "For context, I am 35, and since my early 20’s I have been working for a skilled trade as a machinist. My first few years I put up with all the bs, old head white racist guys saying terrible things. Put in my time and kept my mouth shut for the most part. After 5 years at that place, once day they let myself, and 3 other guys go in one day. No 2 weeks notice for me. After years of overtime, non mandatory Saturdays I was “supposed” to be grateful for, just let go instantly.\n\nWell that was a bit ego hit. It killed my confidence at the time. Luckily my wife was supportive and I found something within a week or two. A much smaller machine shop, with maybe 8 employees. Much better vibes. So I was happy for the most part for a while. I had grown with the company. Had a family. Based a lot of my life around my work. But over the years it has grown, things have changed, and the bosses goals changed.\n\nThis was September 5th of this year. The position I had is no longer available. They’re restructuring how they go about things. But this time it wasn’t as much of an hit to my confidence. I have grown, their decisions had already been made and wouldn’t have changed.\n\nSo I have taken the rest of this month to decompress. This will give my wife a chance to go back to work, I can now take the kids too and from school, and I got a job as a maintenance/groundskeeper that works perfectly with our schedule. I also think I will be much happier\n\nSorry for rambling, but I thought maybe you guys would appreciate this. If I had any advice for a younger person that unfortunately has to work, is don’t get stagnant. Once you do, it’s time to go. Also, “the squeaky wheel gets the grease”. It took me a long time to truly understand that. I choose to not live like that, but unfortunately, people who don’t shut up end up getting raises, position etc. over you. Maybe that’s why I have been in the situations I have been in. You’re just a badge number, don’t forget that. Oh and HR is not there for you, they’re there to protect the company. \n\nOh well. Have a good day!",

We're tech writers normally) at nearly half the pay. We were told to give it some thought and let them know our decisions. I had already accepted the furlough and was going to use this time to finally take a break. However, we were told that if we were to decline these offers we would be laid off. Meanwhile, the other two that didn't get offers, get to just be furloughed. We WERE told (secondhand info via email) that even if we were terminated, we would still have a position on the new contract.\n\n  \nAll of this has been extremely unfair and again, I know management really was just trying to help and it really backfired on him because I know the \"higher ups\" are the ones making these decisions ultimately. I also realize that even with half of my pay, that's MUCH better than unemployment. I just really hate being forced into a decision like this. I've already taken a loan from my 401k and am looking into what would happen to the loan if I was terminated even with a unverified promise of being rehired before the end of the year.\n\n  \nI've been a gov't contractor since 2008 and have never had this happen, but I have only been with like 3 companies during this time. Has anyone ever dealt with this before?",

      "title": "The Harsh Reality of SIPs – Not What You Think",
      "selftext": "There are a lot of things that happen in the world but are never really known to us, thanks to worldwide politics.\n\nLike a study showing drinking coffee can lead to urinary bladder cancer—but it never proceeded further to confirm how much that’s true. Or cockroaches being ground into coffee, and that has been approved from America to the Australian government—because the coffee industry is big and corporates don’t want to lose. Even after the advent of 5G and with most people having access to the internet, such things stay hidden.\n\nI understand the people who don’t have access to the internet also aren’t sipping their Starbucks. This is how the world works.\n\n\n\nSo likewise, there’s an “easy money printing scheme,” and if it’s easy, almost certain, then surely the big boys wouldn’t want us to know—the SIP, systematic investment plan.\n\nUnlike mutual funds or maintained funds where the manager gets a cut, most SIPs, if self-done, only pay minimal fees (via expense ratio and other small charges).\n\nBut that wasn’t always the case. In 2015 or even 2018, SIPs weren’t hyped. It was almost with COVID—suddenly, everyone talked about SIP. Almost every tech YouTuber to news YouTuber pushed SIPs. Every post, every video—more of the same, especially in the immediate post-COVID era.\n\nWait a minute. SIP is a form of trading—mostly buying index. And trading means one has to lose for someone else to win—a zero-sum game.\n\nAnd wait another minute—how come corporates, governments, and the big bulls didn’t react to every common man knowing the “secret sauce” to become a millionaire soon, or at least to ensure their kids would be millionaires?\n\nLike my kids, your kids, everyone’s kids on this sub—millionaires.\n\n\n\nNow, two questions:\n\n1. Why didn’t corporates stop us from knowing, like the coffee example?\n\n2. If all of us win, who will lose? Governments, hedge funds, or Musk/Gates/Ambanis giving us their share until they become poor?\n\nIf I invest 100 per month to get a million, who’s paying?\n\n\n\nSo—here’s the analysis and the fck reality.\n\nAs per my knowledge, SIP is very widely done in India—so from now on, currencies in Indian rupees (INR).\n\nLet’s say someone with 2 kids earns ₹40,000/month (\\~$450 USD).\n\nOut of this, he pays health insurance, life/term insurance, taxes, takes care of wife and kids, school fees, and so on—and somehow goes into extreme frugality to put ₹10,000/month (\\~$110 USD) into SIP. Wow.\n\nSo as a result—he loses vacations, holidays, movies, dinners, outings, and a lot of basic needs and happiness. But f\\*ck, man, he is planning for 20 years. He invests ₹24 lakhs, and gets back about ₹92 lakhs after 20 years.\n\nThat’s $27,000 invested and getting back $103,000—all assuming 12% growth as shown by national index funds in the past decade.\n\nIsn’t it awesome? $70K, almost 4.5 times return. That changes a family from poor to rich, at least in the Indian subcontinent. That’s huge money.\n\n\n\nSo, with sacrifice of happiness, peace, vacations, movies, dining, and everyday joy—the father somehow made his kids rich, moving a hierarchy above.\n\nBut here’s the catch: inflation.\n\nInflation averages around 6%, so the growth is not 12% like we think—it’s 6%.\n\nEveryone says, “Even 6% growth after inflation is huge.”\n\nRight. But let’s look at buying power and the HUGE politics behind it that everyone fails to realize.\n\n\n\nExamples:\n\n1. iPhones. Expensive in India because of import costs and taxes. Post-COVID, iPhones are manufactured in India—technically no import duties. People expected huge price drops. Surprise—“Made in India” iPhones cost the same as “Made in China.” Why? Because the company itself doesn’t want to reduce prices. Not just the government, the company too.\n\n2. Biryani. Average price went from ₹70 to ₹130–150 after GST and supply chain issues. Now GST reduced, raw materials stabilized. Still, biryani prices remain high. Why? Vendors realized people accepted the higher price.\n\n3. Onion raita. Onion shortage made vendors add cucumber/cabbage to cut costs. Shortage ended, onions cheap again—but they still add cucumber and cabbage.\n\nThese show: even after costs fall, businesses—from big brands to roadside vendors—stick to higher prices. Because once people accept it, profits rise. But they forget the “more money” they earn buys less.\n\n\n\nSo going back:\n\n12% growth → 6% growth after inflation. But real buying power is far less – About 28.5 Lakhs in Todays Terms \\~31500USD. Its kind of 0.17 % all the way from 4.5 Times.\n\nDont FORGET – Capital Gain Tax, Expense ratio, Opportunity and happiness Cost.\n\nYou can land in the odd spot where the nominal returns look higher than what you invested, yet the buying power after 20 years is actually lower than your original contributions today.\n\n\n\nSo after 20 years of sacrifice, vacations missed, discipline held—the hardest part—you’re not rich. You’re staying where you are.\n\nNo one’s paying you from their pocket. They’re giving you back exactly what you invested plus a little growth.\n\nSo, who’s losing in this zero-sum game?\n\nIt’s you.\n\nNot JPMorgan, not BlackRock, not Ambanis or Jack Ma. You.\n\nYou gave your money—₹24 lakhs / $21K—for free, interest-free, for 20 years. ₹10K/month for someone else, interest-free.\n\nThe interest loss, the buying power companies gain from your money—all your loss.\n\n\n\nI’m not against SIP. It still yields profit, so I do recommend it. But don’t think:\n\n“I’m 30, I’ll do SIP for 20 years, retire at 50 with financial freedom.”\n\nThat’s not happening.\n\nKnow what’s real, then decide. Don’t dream misinformed and get f\\*cked 20 years later.\n\n\n\n⚠️ Warning: This is not financial advice. Just an analysis based on how politics, inflation, and real-world economics work. Do your own research before investing.\n\nSalary hikes + Increasing SIP yearly with certain percentage is not considered here for simplicity.\n\nIF I’M WRONG I’M OPEN FOR CRITICS, No HATE PLEASE.\n\n",

      "selftext": "After reading a post about a European asking if it would be worth it to work in the US for a few years, worrying about not getting PTO, vacation, etc so many people said \"you have to work for the right company\" or \"you have to have an advanced degree if you want those perks\".  It made me realize work in this country is extremely classist.  Take most big box stores.  CEOs and managers who sit in an office all day long get scads of paid time off, paid holidays, and often paid family leave.  The people on their feet all day long, stocking shelves, helping (often rude, angry) customers, and manning the cash registers get nothing.  Even worse, if a company mandates employees who work 30+ hours a week are entitled to PTO, they will only hire part timers, meaning the employee has to hold 2 or more jobs and often work 7 days a week for little pay.  You're sick?  Too bad, you have to go to work anyway because you can't afford to take an unpaid day off nor can you afford to go to the doctor and provide a note for your employer so you won't get yelled at for calling out.  And yet, everyone blames those employees for being in that situation.  News flash, not everyone is cut out for college.  And we need these people to keep our society moving along.  EVERYONE, regardless of what they do deserve paid time off and holidays to rest, recharge, and take care of their health.  I wish I could start a movement that everyone, regardless of what they do, and whether they are part time or full time, could get paid time off so everyone could have time for themselves and still be able to afford the essentials of food and shelter.  3 weeks should be the minimum.",

I’ve felt very icky about the manager ever since this happened. I’m new to this company, and maybe it was playful and I’m just missing it but it felt pretty targeted and the vibes have honestly been off since.\n\nI personally believe the concerns should have been addressed privately face to face with said employee.

I’ve just personally noticed it more “recently”.\n\nI notice this as not only an employee but as a customer as well. \n\nI hear the remarks like “no one wants to work anymore” but yet nearly every single retail store, restaurant and even entertainment places could benefit from having an extra 3-4 workers on the schedule. \n\nI guess I just don’t understand why it’s like that? As a company wouldn’t you think it would be more efficient to have enough people on staff that way your company runs smoothly and can get more profit. \n\nI’m using hypotheticals here but if you work at a grocery store and got 2 guys running the entire produce department, at some point if it’s a busy football Sunday or the first of the month, realistically even IF they run around they simply will never be able to put out enough product and keep up with the crowds. So even if you had one extra person helping them then you would be getting so much more product onto the floor which equals mores sales/money. \n\nLike you’re literally losing potential profit across the board yearly by not having enough hands. \n \nI just don’t get it. \n\nAnd I mean I’m looking at this as someone who is in this situation at my own job. However as a customer to many of these places it is frustrating waiting in line forever because they only got like 2 registers open lol (I’m not rude about it though, I understand it’s not their fault)\n\nI know this is all very noticeable from a customer perspective to because the quality in almost everything just fucking sucks. Less quality control and worse customer service. I know this is totally a first world problem but sitting in a fast food line for 20 minutes to be handed much lower quality food by someone who’s in a terrible mood all while paying $20 for it is just not it lmao ",

      "selftext": "Hey all\n\nAn independent Builders Merchant that i've worked for just over three years now issued me a 4-week redundancy notice on Friday, two days ago. Two other people were made redundant, the company looks like it will be closing up on the horizon and until then running on a skeleton team until the stock holding value is low enough for the MD to shut the business.\n\nThe other two redundancies were put on gardening leave, so they effectively left immediately. One was the yard foreman and the other, external sales. My job role was/is stock control, whilst having a hand in most other areas of the business. I also have vastly superior knowledge of the sales and accounting software system than anyone else in the business and that is the main reason I believe they have not put me on gardening leave like the other two because they need me to pass pm my knowledge to the rest whilst I'm still effectively an employee.\n\nI've managed to find another job which starts just after the redundancy ends, which means I should be getting a payout as well as the monies I'll have earned until then. But I just feel like shit. I feel as not only am I not wanted anymore but also like I don't belong. I'm supposed to keep working as I have the last three years but knowing that on 24th October it'll be my last day with the company and everything I do at the moment is for long term gain for the business, it feels like, personally I'm just wasting my time.\n\nThere isn't any sick pay at my current place so I cannot reasonably take any time off between now and the end, although they do owe me a week in holidays so I might see if I can take my last week as holiday - it'll save them money, so they might accept it.\n\nAnyway, just feel like I wanted to rant somewhere. The company was never a great place to work, with no sick pay, barely any raises, no bonuses, barely any HR to speak of. At almost 40 years old I'm yet to work for a company that seems bothered about the staff.\n\nAny tips on how to make the last few weeks less grim for me? I'm conscious they may be looking for reasons to get rid of me before the redundancy comes in, in order to not give me the payout, so putting in notably less effort is probably off the cards.",

      "selftext": "I’ve been in my current job for about a month and a half. On my very first day, a coworker warned me about someone — let’s call her Karen:\n\n\"Just so you know, she can be hard to deal with. Someone quit recently because of her.\"\n\nAfter a few shifts with Karen, I understood why. She undermines me, bosses me around, uses passive-aggressive comments, talks to me like I’m incompetent (I’m an immigrant), and compares me to other coworkers — for example, praising someone else while criticizing me in front of them, without addressing me directly.\n\nAt first I tried to cope, but it quickly added up. I started dreading shifts with her, came home drained, and the stress is amplified because I have cognitive disabilities. This only happens with her; I have no issues with anyone else.\n\nFast forward to today: a senior coworker quit because of Karen. Since I witnessed an argument between them, my boss asked me how Karen behaves and whether she causes problems for me. I told the truth: she’s a hard worker but difficult, stressful, and undermining. My boss acknowledged it was a pattern.\n\nThen Karen spun everything against me. I was called into the office with both of them and was suddenly criticized for things that weren’t relevant at the time, including being told I need to “communicate better” and implying I don’t understand the language — even though I have a C1 certificate and had previously been cleared by my boss. Karen also blamed other things on me. Now I’m the “problem,” despite no one else having complaints and Karen being known for pushing multiple people to quit.\n\nI like this job and don’t want to leave over one toxic coworker, but I’m reaching my limit. My boss will likely ask for feedback again, and I don’t want to lie — but I also don’t want Karen to spin it against me again.\n\nTL;DR: A toxic coworker has a history of making people quit. She’s now targeting me, manipulates situations to make me look like the problem, and I need advice on how to deal with that situation.",

I’ve been there now almost one whole year. \n\nBut recently they cut the hours back so that we are working just under forty hours. The one upshot is that at this particular facility, we are always so far behind that I can pick up extra shifts as often as I want so that I can at east get a tiny fraction of overtime needed to barely put a dent in the debt that me and my husband have been spiraling into.\n\nHe had a major stroke last year and although he recovered enough to go back to work, he still had difficulties that his previous workplace would not accommodate. He is a CNA and he currently works at the same facility I’m at. But his health has been such a roller coaster that I have spent huge chunks of time working double and triple shifts so I can at least keep the lights and the gas paid off as well as the lot rent. \n\nI realize it’s my own fault being so readily willing to sacrifice myself. I just finished a sixteen hour shift last night and in a few minutes I will be starting another one. A few weeks ago I even worked 24 hours straight (three shifts) and I’m not exactly burning out but I know there’s a brick wall with my name on it any time now. \n\nI’m doing the best I can.",

It isn't the only thing,by a long shot. \n\n I defended myself to my boss and asked her if she really thought these things sounded like me. I got no reply. These girls are already given preferential treatment by my boss,even tho my boss told me that she knows these girls are mean,they lie,and I shouldn't worry about her believing them. \n\n At the end of this meeting, I was told to no longer speak to my coworkers, unless it involves work.

It’s like an algorithm generated echo chamber of information you totally agree with or are enraged by that creates polarized extremes, there is amplification of divergence. He is a crystallization of everything wrong with the past in a single person, and was able to con people into voting for him by appealing to the evil in them he embodies. Every day a new distraction. More circus, less critical thought. \n\nMeanwhile the average wage gap between CEOs and workers is a ratio of $285 to $1. So for every dollar you are paid, your CEO pays themselves $285. In 1965 it was $20 to $1. A fair wage got you a house and could support a family with only one wage earner. While the quality of life for the employee has plummeted and the cost of living rises despite technological developments, policing, monitoring, and control of information is at levels never conceived of by the nation’s founders. Population has increased worldwide, but the resources globally are held by fewer individuals. Capitalism unchecked has become feudalism. \n\nWe are peasants. Corporations have the same legal rights as citizens, and can violate the rights of citizens without CEOs ever being held accountable. Corporations have no physical body to imprison, the people who own them have a sacrificial entity to protect them from repercussion and give the illusion to the peasants that there is not even a castle at all. They are lords over fiefdoms. Instead of fields they have massive companies. The stone walls keeping the riches in and the poor people out have been replaced with demographic and legislative ones impossible to lay siege to. \n\nRegardless of who is the president at any given time, we are now empire. We have a king. No one wants to admit it. Whichever way the vote went, the empire would remain. One will rotate out with another whose turn it is. The lords will profit as the peasants suffer. It doesn’t matter what we started as when all were all created equal. It got highjacked, or our vices amplified our shortcomings and greed to such extremes that we became the very thing we rebelled against but with the mass delusion of equality. Now the peasants don’t know they’re peasants, happily consuming propaganda in their free time to keep them from realizing at any time they are free to regain control. Divided against themselves, controlled by media, policed and monitored, yet free at any time to collectively change reality if they could only see the cardboard castle on the hill through the haze, its walls made strong by lies told to keep them from their own reality.

      "selftext": "I’m just flabbergasted. I’ve been with my company for two years. I got a huge promotion for a different branch across the country (Texas to New York). The branch isn’t open, so I had to do some training in Ohio and a couple weeks in Georgia for 4 months.\nFor four months this company paid for my rentals, hotels, and food. Not to mention the labor of those training me as well as my own wages. For four months I was amongst strangers and working with people I would never see again. And across four months, I saw what an absolute train wreck my management team was. \nThey took no accountability when things went wrong. They were harsh and cold in their communication, and they were constantly gaslighting me and setting me up to be the scapegoat for their failures. Not to mention, my boss has zero grammar or spelling skills. The amount of times I would receive teams messages like “I need to here from you today,” or “I solved the mistry” was dragging on my soul. Even the Ohio and Georgia people saw their incompetence and didn’t disagree when I said I was thinking about leaving. \nI love the company. I really do. I love that we help a lot of people and I love the benefits and how much time off they give us (I’m in the US, so these things are exceedingly rare), so when I talked to my manager and said “sorry I’m too homesick to do this move” she said she understood and we would find something mutually beneficial for us moving forward. I told her that reason because I thought it would keep the peace and not ruffle any feathers. \nI set up an interview with a Dallas branch, and they offer me the job on the spot. It’s the same position, and they would have to lower my pay a bit, but I didn’t even care, I just needed out. \nNext thing I know, I’m expected to stay with the New York branch until they hire AND FULLY TRAIN my replacement. Which could take anywhere from 4-8 months. In which time I would have to pay for my own hotel, rental, and food… in New York. Which is insanely expensive and I wouldn’t be able to afford that. \nSo they denied my transfer to the Dallas branch, and told me if I don’t show up at the new center in New York for a walk through on Monday, they would consider it my voluntary resignation. And yes, HR was looped in on all of this. \nSo, I’m sitting at my brother’s house, on the Saturday before the walkthrough, in Dallas, thinking about what to do next. All I know is I guess I’m voluntarily resigning on Monday. \nMy feelings on the situation fluctuate from one moment to the next. I sent a Hail Mary email to the district manager, but she won’t budge. \nI’m angry, I’m sad, I’m at a loss.\nI finally found a career path and an industry I’m passionate about, and I finally stood up for myself and got myself out of a toxic situation before it consumed me… but now I have no job, no house, and no car. My brother is being very kind and letting me stay with him until I can get back on my feet, but I feel like I’m mourning what I lost and what could have been. \nI’m trying to be hopeful. I’m trying to stay calm. I know at the very least I can enter a phlebotomy program and work for a hospital instead of plasma, but it’s not the same. And even then, I’m not above a barista or retail job. \n\nTLDR; these people don’t care about you. Do what’s best for you. ",

Some take longer of course, but we figured out issues pretty fast for the most part. Every morning the customer service hub would have a bunch of tickets from after hour requests. We'd call them back and do any incoming ones, and then we'd have an empty ticket queue by the end of day usually. We'd work hard for 4 hours and the rest of the day was pretty easy.\n\nThen the new management implemented a tracking policy that would measure how much time we spend on doing tickets. If we spend less than 90% of our time at work on the tickets (not including the half hour lunch and 2 coffee breaks), we are written up. Two senior employees got written up because at the end of day we did all the tickets and there was nothing left to do. They tried to explain that there is no more tickets to do but they're told to \"find more work to do.\"\n\nSo we all found more work to do. Every ticket that could take 5 minutes, now took us 10 or 15. We had to look up EVERY avenue of problem solution after all. Calls and screens are not recorded, so all of a sudden the customer is asking us more questions that we have to find information on and explain. And all of a sudden our computers are acting slow and taking longer to load.\n\nNow the customer service queue is full at the end of day and it just keeps getting bigger and bigger. Banging out lots of tickets isn't important to them, so we don't aim to do that anymore. Management keeps asking us why the ticket queue is full now. We shrug and say it's just how it is. They hired three new people to help with the tickets. But we are responsible for training them, and we made sure to teach them not to work too fast. We don't want them getting in trouble after all and the boss said \"take care of the newbies\". Gotcha boss, we will take care to make sure they don't get written up.",

I take public transportation to and from work.\n\n(Today) I had a meeting because I was late to work yesterday because my train was stuck between two stops. I tried to call them 3 times and they never answered the phone. In the meeting, they called my operations manager and he indirectly called me a grievance. A damn grievance. Then he kept snapping at me about how I can never take responsibility and how about setting your alarm. Yea, I am occasionally late because of things out of my control, but in no way do I deserve to be talked to like that.\n\nYea, last year was a rough year for my attendance but I doubt anybody would want to keep coming to a job that here their current assignment is constantly sending you home with scratches and bruises and they don’t do shit about it but tell you write it up. \n\nI had to step out keep from losing my shit and earning myself a termination letter, and they couldn’t even give me a few minutes to collect myself. My union rep came out and said what we’re not gonna do is make a scene. I broke down, and I’m not proud of it. We argued for a minute. There wouldn’t have been a scene if she’d just given me a second, it’s not like I stormed out or anything, I just asked to be excused for a moment. The meeting ended with me getting suspended for 2 days but I knew that was coming already.\n\nThere are several employees there that could get away with skipping the country on them and others my ops manager wouldn’t dare insult like that, because unlike them, I don’t take pride in going off at the slightest inconvenience. I hate that man. Every interaction with that god forsaken man is a problem, and I don’t even have to say anything more than good morning to him. The only reason I haven’t told them all to rot in hell and quit is because I’m trying to move in a year and a new job lower paying job would throw all that work to the wind for another 2 years. I’m not trying to stay in my current state that long.\n\nSorry for the long post, but I need to get it out. Oh and a quick warning, if anybody thinks about working for We transport, don’t. You’ll be penalized for the smallest mistakes and torn down to the point of a mental breakdown. Unless you know somebody in management that’ll cover for you every time.",

      "selftext": "Hi, come here to vent/de-brief more than anything so apologies in advance for rambling.\n\nI started my new job about 18 months ago in a new department. I was really excited and thrilled they chose me to work with them. I was genuinely honoured to have the opportunity.\n\nMy first day was quite odd. I was shown to an empty office and just… left there. This is how it’s pretty much been since. \n\nMy manager Dan didn’t really spend any time with me to show me the ropes, introduce me to others, or even try to interact with me. I thought the set up was strange and I felt very isolated. \n\nIt was the same with my other colleagues. They seemed to really keep themselves to themselves. No one really spoke to me or even said hello some days. I would go into work and barely speak to a soul. Just in an office on my own the entire shift.\n\nI was asked to manage a really challenging employee. They were just awful. Made multiple complaints about me that were wild.  Things like I was “seeking retribution” or I was “trying to sabotage” etc. they were pretty unhinged, from seemingly nowhere, and it was obviously built on mental health issues. It became really difficult to go into work and face the day as I knew this person was on the war path and I was isolated. Loads more happened around that and I don’t want to get into it too much on here, but believe me when I say, it was crazy and surreal.\n\nI raised it to Dan quite early on, and told him that the situation was really affecting my mental health. It felt beyond me and I needed support. Dan did nothing. I just had to take the abuse. It nearly broke me and I started to think I was overreacting as Dan used to roll his eyes and look like I was taking up too much of his time whenever I would try to tell him what was going on. \n\nIt transpires that the crazy paranoid employee originally wanted to apply for my job but was told not to. Subsequently they sought some sort of revenge with a campaign of hatred against me, and were going around the team making seriously nasty comments about me, and that is why they excluded me. They never invited me to team nights out or activities, never included me in general chit chat, some wouldn’t even look at me. They believed the employee until they got to the point of crazy paranoid obsession. The team noticed that the employee was unhinged, and started to question the whole thing.\n\nApparently Dan knew all of this (including what was being said about me) but chose to ignore it and watch me burn. Many have apologised to me since finding out I’m not a bad person, but Dan hasn’t. Dan’s last day was today. He didn’t say a word to me just left. However, gushed over everyone else. I just feel so angry. I’ll never know what I did to him to deserve that.\n\nFeeling horrible about the situation but at the same time, I now know I wasn’t going crazy. The mental employee made my life hell and Dan could have stopped it but didn’t. He just watched on as I became more and more broken. \n\nLooking to leave the department as I don’t think I will ever feel okay here. Even though colleagues are now including me in the team, and have apologised, I feel the damage has been done. I’ve been stuck in this department as the job market isn’t great, but I hear there will be some jobs coming up in other departments within my company around November. Can’t wait to get myself out of here.",

      "selftext": "Merely writing the title of my post depresses the hell out of me: I intended to write something personal, but I realize that most, if not all, of you lurkers on this sub are in the thrall of some rich asshole or assholes. While there has doubtless always existed a yawning abyss between socioeconomic classes, the widening of that abyss, and the necessary tension that arises from that widening, is becoming increasingly pronounced in this era where fortunes are passed around fecklessly between wealthy people in the same way that boys swap trading cards. They eat multi-million dollar bananas while we just hope to lick the peel.\n\nI'm growing more disillusioned with the economic governance of the rich and the rampant corruption that has become institutional. In my profession, I have to work quite closely with very high net-worth people and their children, and what frustrates me the most is how the rich fail to see the humanity of the underlings that live only to serve them: each individual who works for them is merely an object whose value is determined exclusively by the function which it performs, a tool designed to effect their will.\n\nI'm coming to believe that rich people genuinely believe the narrative that their wealth is a manifestation of their value to society, in the same way that Calvinists believed that how one lived one's live was a manifestation of whether one was predestined for heaven or not. The vastness of their fortune is commensurate with their intelligence and insight, and therefore it is impossible that anyone with a less vast fortune could have any expertise that would not be immediately available to them.\n\nSo I, being not of vast fortune, find myself denigrated on a daily basis by rich assholes, in order that I can afford to live. Part of me wants to revolt and to give up on working entirely. Part of me tries to find some silver linings in all of it--the actual work is not that difficult, it's reasonably well remunerated, I can mostly work from home--and I often feel like a spoiled brat for wanting to quit, because I know that so many people have it so much worse than I do, professionally speaking. \n\nPart of me wants to do my own version of Quiet Quitting, by just acting like Dominique Francon in the The Fountainhead (I know there won't be many Ayn Rand lovers here, but the analogy is apt): being excessively servile to the rich person, completely and ostentatiously effacing my own contributions and, by extension, effacing myself entirely. I sincerely wonder if the rich would relish in my complete and utter self-alienation, as they will now have the tool that they are renting---or would they perhaps realize that a perfectly flaccid worker is not ideal at all? \n\nSorry for the long post---I obviously needed to rant a little bit. Take comfort knowing that this rant was written while on the clock, and so I have successfully stuck my hand into the pocket of some rich bastard and pulled out just a tiny fistful of justice.",

No mortgage on current house, small car payments minor debt. \nBut HEALTH CARE holy fuck. So we took some simple jobs to get health insurance and the damn deductible is $5000 at each of our jobs. So we figured ok suck it up until 65 medicare and social security kick in.\nNow they want to raise the age on social security. Now we sit here and wonder. We did all the right things never lived above our means. Took vacations but nothing extravagant so we could get to a place where we could actually take it easy.\nBut now with inflation and the tax law hitting us, doctors and dentists bills and prescriptions, just seems like we have to work till we die.",

      "selftext": "On Sunday afternoon, September 21, 43-year-old UPS driver Shelma Reyna Guerrero was crushed to death while loading packages inside a cargo trailer at the company’s facility on Atlas Road in Richmond, California.\n\nAccording to police, Guerrero was working alone inside the trailer around 4:15 p.m. when an avalanche of packages fell onto her. A co-worker later discovered her injured body and called 911, but emergency responders declared her dead at the scene. On the [GoFundMe](https://www.gofundme.com/f/in-memory-of-shelma-reyna-support-needed) page set up by her family, it is reported that she leaves five children behind.\n\nThe fund page mentions the “malfunction of a machine.” Workers in the area confirmed on social media that the extendable conveyor at trailer door 89 “has been malfunctioning for some time.”\n\nOn Reddit, a co-worker fondly remembered Shelma. “She was so friendly, had a beautiful smile. I would see her and she would say, ‘I love your hair,’ and she would smile that big gorgeous smile. I would tell her, ‘I love your smile, it’s so infectious! RIP SHELMA ❤️”\n\nThe worker described the callous and profit-driven response of UPS to the preventable death. “They shut us down for about 2 hours between both shifts and then started the building back up. Left her in the trailer with the door open.”\n\nEven in death, Shelma was not spared indignities by the corporation. The worker said Shelma, “was in a bodybag and then some idiot (my opinion) covered her with small sort bags because they thought it would be better than us seeing the body bag. She was still in the building when we left after 11pm. They wouldn’t let anyone close the trailer cause the police said it was a crime scene.”\n\nThe worker concluded:\n\n“It was just business as usual. I’m so angry, upset and just freaking pissed off. The lack of respect, compassion and empathy they showed her in death just killed me. I know OSHA (Occupational Health and Safety) and the police had to investigate but it still seemed callous to me to have us in there working. I just needed to share this. I’m just so upset.”\n\nRead the rest of the article [here.](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2025/09/26/uvaz-s26.html)",

      "selftext": "In short, been working at this Iowa manufacturer for 5yrs. I’ve always had outstanding reviews and decent pay bumps. This year, I only got 2.8% despite another outstanding review. It only would’ve been 15 cents more to match inflation, so I made my case for it. They mischaracterized my request for meeting a cost of living adjustment as “just wants more money,” then they laughed and said no. So I took my request to HR who thought I should make more based on my review. However, after talking with those supervisors, they’re now dangling it like a carrot - take on even more responsibilities and they’ll consider it. \n\nI’m so flabbergasted. The disrespect is just so out of left field and I’ve already started looking for work. Problem is, I live right down the road, I already have 3 weeks vacation (company starts with 2 which is rare in this area) and not too many other places nearby pay enough or they do but there’s a longer commute and different hours. \n\nI’m tempted to put in my 2WN without a backup plan just to see if they try to keep me. Based on our current deadlines and that they’re having trouble hiring (obvious reasons) I think they need me a lot more than I need them. It took them years to find someone like me who not only does the job in 20min rather than an hour, but will go to other lines to help out. I know Im expendable like everyone else, but at this point it would take 2-3 people to replace me.\n\nI also know this would potentially strain my professional relationships with my supervisors but they did it first and something tells me they’ll do it again now that they think they can get away with it. Regardless, I do like my job and some of my coworkers, the pay is technically decent, and the location is great - but it strained my relationship with my bosses and it’ll likely happen again. Company isn’t necessarily toxic, but the supervisors express toxic positivity if that makes sense.\n\nMy home life is working wife and 2 kids so unemployment isn’t ideal in the state of Iowa.",

She even said, “you’re nice to everyone else except me,” which made no sense, and when I asked what she meant, she brushed it off with “forget it.”\n\n-  Yesterday, I told her I needed to log off at 4 for a doctor’s appointment.

I was fortunate to get hired thanks to a kind department supervisor who saw potential in me, especially during a tough period in my life when I was unemployed and searching for work. Fast forward a year, and I've been happy there, for the first six months my lead was on maternity leave. Both she and her partner are leads for my department, and whenever they speak to me, it often feels condescending.\n\nWe have monthly one-on-one meetings with both of them and my supervisor. While I usually get positive reviews, there was one recent concern I addressed openly, assuring them I’d be more careful in the future. However, this month’s meeting was rescheduled without explanation—something they’ve done before. On the day of the scheduled meeting, my lead called to scold me about repeating a mistake. I calmly explained that I was requesting certain records I believed would help our work, but she dismissed it as unnecessary and a waste of time. Despite my apology and promise to improve, she continued criticizing me over a mistake about a wrong date.\n\nFeeling belittled after her relentless critique, I simply thanked her for the call and said I’d see her at our next scheduled meeting. The truth is, I feel targeted—like she’s looking for any excuse to get me fired. She’s scrutinizing everything I do, even when my coworkers make similar or worse mistakes. Interestingly, we have weekly department meetings to discuss updates and issues, and this past week, the focus was on me—specifically, my sharing outage updates and a meme in the main chat. Everyone else does the same, yet she insists we should be using a different chat platform, which another supervisor previously said we no longer needed to use. ",

It's not for everyone, but I legit, 100% love the work.  Go back to 2000...  I had a great job...  The first few years were fantastic...  It was still work and all, but we just did the work.  Sometime in 2005 or so, we went through a big re-org and all the leadership got swapped out for corporate knob slobbers.  I plotted my escape, and a couple of years later I was on my way.\n\nI landed in a small consulting firm...  it was pretty good to start...  but within weeks, the owner/CEO hired a bunch of management consultants, and they totally fucked the place up.  Off to the next one.  That job was actually fucked from the get-go...  it just took me a while to realize it.  But once I did, I was off again.\n\nLanded a GREAT job.  They wanted me to do the work...  They approved my hires, my budgets, my projects...  What more can you really ask for?  Well, a few years into that and the fucking corporate dick swallowers showed up again.  Here we go, leveraging synergies...  Maximizing efficiencies...  So, off to the next one.\n\nAnother GREAT gig!  Same thing... they want to do the work... I want to do the work...  It's a match made in heaven.  We had a great few years.  But could it last?  Nah...  The fucking corporate jizz felchers are back, and my job just went from doing the fucking work to talking about why we can't do the fucking work yet again.  Oh?  You wanted something done?  Sorry...  We don't have a programme for that.\n\nI'm so fucking sick of this shit.  I don't even know where I'd look at this point.  Companies with 30 fucking people are deciding they need a Project Management Organization and Change Management Strategy consultants.  I'm fucking allergic to this nonsense.  I just want to do the motherfucking work.  I don't want to spend endless conference calls determining why the motherfucking stars haven't aligned *just so* such that somebody can fucking do something.\n\nI think I'm going to truck driving school...

But that's not the case, they'll have you working 15-21, then want you 6-15 the next day, forever, week in, week out. \n\nAlso, retail workers/service workers, or anyone who faces the general public in while doing their job, should have more rights to have a backbone. Hang up the phone, refuse service, etc. Like I get that dealing with certain problems is difficult, but, this is straight up verbal abuse, and unfortunately, sometimes escalates to physical. Like I cannot reiterate enough customers need to be told no more often. Because, and yes I'm well aware this is the slippery slope argument, but it's kinda true, but sure, one day you'll take their return without a receipt, maybe you're feeling nice or you just want to get rid of the customer, perfectly valid. The next week, they're back demanding you give them a discount that ended yesterday. You sigh, but, give in. After all, what's a few dollars less to a multi billion megacorp? Then that week after, they're back, demanding you give a sale on an item that's not on sale, but the item next to it is, so it looked like that one was on sale too. You see where this is going?\n\nAnd on top of that, when a customer throws a hissy fit and ends up getting what they wanted, not only have you just made that customer more entitled, anyone around them also gets a signal that we allow ourselves to be walked over like doormats, so you also created a bunch of other customers that now know without tantrum throwing, they also can get items that are no longer on sale, returns without a receipt, etc. \n\nThey should just make it impossible for registers to take a return without a receipt, impossible to manually override a coupon, impossible to manually give a sale. Let's see how many weeks until people finally learn to behave and stop being entitled. \n\nOh and also pay us more lol. Fym I need to get out of bed at 5am for 11/hour. ",

I know I am the problem, not the job, and I'm working in therapy on figuring shit out.\n\nHowever, until then, I still want to do something and not just sit at home. I am an analytic person, I like studying a lot, researching, reading, I am also passionate about culture, films, art, books, languages. \n\nI have graduated from dentistry, but because of the aforementioned problem, it's been really hard to face stress at work and I can't say that I have any special interest for this domain.\n\nSo I am thinking, for the beginning, of some back office work, where I have little interaction with people, maybe documents, numbers, writing stuff. Something where I can start right away (no more postponing action with courses and universities), work in silence, with less pressure. \n\nI've been looking at job listings, but haven't found anything satisfying yet or haven't been approached. Do you have any ideas, what or where to look for?\n\nIf you had similar experiences, feel free to share your experience. Thanks!",

They gave us 3 days from it being emailed, or we no longer had jobs. All of my coworkers including myself, did so and it seemed like it would be a smooth transition. I did notice though, that in my new offer letter, that I signed and sent, had an increased Vacation Accrual Rate. It was originally 2.31 hours per week and the new offer letter stated 3.08. The .77 difference equates to about 40 hours more of vacation time per year. I didnt get the new payroll app until about 3 weeks after the offer letter was signed. I noticed in the app that my Vacation Accrual Rate is only 2.31, and has been since the switch. I brought this up to HR and they said oh, well your old rate was 2.31, so we are going to continue that and send an updated offer letter.\n\nI live in Portland, OR.

They recommend talking to an attorney if I wanted to push it for a contract issue. \n\nThis is the easiest/most laid back job I have ever had and it is also the most money I have ever made, with an ideal schedule. I don't like being played like this, but I am not sure I want to risk the whole job for an extra week of vacation. \n\nAny advice? \n\n",

      "title": "I quit a pretty good job after my 3rd day working there, and I feel conflicted that maybe I could’ve made things work.",
      "selftext": "I worked for my family car detail company for 10 years. Iv been out of work for just a little over a year now. During that time I made good friends with an older gentleman we will call him T. T ran a mobile detail supply truck that’s bigger than your usual box truck. Recently he got injured, and I was the first one he called to ask if I wanted his job. I agreed, and a few short days later I was eating lunch with his boss. We will call his boss F. F explained to me T getting injured was a complete curve ball, and he wanted me to get started as soon as possible. F said he planned on training me for 3 days, then would “throw me to the wolves” (his exact words). exactly the next day I was put into that huge truck (no previous experience, has air brakes type of thing) with another employee to teach me, and I drove that truck like a champ. We did ok on the job however, that employee traveled 2 hours away, and we only did 4 stops, he had to leave early. My second day same thing, employee was with me helping me along the way we did 7 stops that time completing the list of stops that T supplied me with, I thought I did pretty good. The plan through all this was that the third day the boss would ride with me on the busiest day of the week. On the third day however, in the morning I was sent a group text that F talked to the employee, and thought I was ready to work on my own. (I was honestly too big for my britches at this point, I thought I could man up and handle things) after that text I would then meet up with T, and he would again supply me with my list of stops. The list had 15 stops written on it, and I was asked to handle any customers that needed me on the work phone (I’ll probably mention it down the line but 5-8 people were asking me to swing by them by the end of the day). The place I needed to go to for this day is an hour away from my city. So I loaded up the truck, and off I went. It was ok for a while, I was pretty slow doing things because I wasn’t sure where to park the truck at these stops, often doing long trips on foot bringing heavy containers of supplies. I did 9 stops until I realized I was running out of time, and I still haven’t hit up any of the mobile detail company’s, so I plugged in this persons address (I was meeting at their home), and on the way by god I don’t know how it happened, I had to turn left a mile up the road so I went to the far left lane a mile before. my eyes never left the road, I was perfectly in my lane. When suddenly I heard a hard sturdy *thud* on the left side of me. The L shape of my left mirror was perfectly intact, but the mirror was hanging by two wires. When I got to the light (it was red) I tried shoving the mirror back into place which worked at first, until I got back into the truck, and closed the door a little too hard, and the mirror fell again, hanging by wires. I would repeat this process 2 more times, and the mirror would actually fall down hitting the ground shattering during this time. Despite this I was still determined to try, and finish the job. I got to the house, and met with the customers. The way I was taught to handle the payment was in two ways.\n\n1. I would type in the computer the company name write up the supply’s they need, and print out an invoice later to send the company.\n\n2. I would do the same process, but some customers would pay by card, so I don’t need to print an invoice. \n\nSo I ask “what is your business’s name” they said the business name clearly despite the language barrier. I can’t find it in the system, so I struggle a bit to try to figure out what to do. Eventually I ask can I run your card? Me stopping at a household I thought maybe things were run a little more under the table. They say “yes” so I run the card, and hand over the products. Then they ask “receipt?” I’m in a full panic at this point, I just ran a card with no way of knowing how to go back, and print a receipt, wasn’t sure if that was even possible. I frantically looked all over the computer for a solution for 5 minutes with people staring at me, untill I reluctantly said “no receipt” they were not happy. So on my way I went with a shattered left mirror that was in place for a while until it fully fell, and got left behind while I was on the road. I was out of time at this point. Businesses were closing up. I gave my dad a call, he helped set this job up. “Dad, I think I’m already going to quit this job”. Then I started heading home. With the job unfinished, and damage to the truck.\n\nOn the road (I had an hour to think about things) I felt I could be forgiven for the damage, but leaving the job unfinished with no more on the road guidance was it for this job. I only needed 1 more day of help, and I would’ve slayed at this job.\n\nWhen I got to where we keep the truck, I gave T a call, told him about the damage, and that this job wasn’t for me. The next day in the morning F gave me a call, and I told him the same thing. I would then meet up with T to hand things back over. T profusely apologized, which was weird considering I damaged the truck, but he said it wasn’t that bad. He mentioned that F set me up for failure. T then looked at the computer, and said despite everything I did outstanding, and did everything correct, and that I even handled the places he thought I would have trouble with amazingly, excluding the card situation back at that house. He told me though the way I did it was fixable, and was “ingenious” the way I did it. After all this was done we would both go our separate ways. \n\n\nOut of all this, and before I hit send. I want to put emphasis on T. I don’t know how it would come across with what I typed out. But despite being injured, he went above, and beyond helping me as much as he could remotely. Having said that, I guess I’m going to look over what I typed, and then “throw it to the wolves” as they say.",

In front of customers, she complains \"you should be doing thisssssssssss\", etc.\n\nI'm not going to lie, I did react to some of this negatively, and things eventually turned to a head today. She started giving me some lecture about how I wasn't performing, and she actually said I was supposed to have learned all my delivery and clerical work within 1.5 weeks. *Mind you, the person who trained me told me it took him months to learn only the delivery portion of his work.*\n\nI was worried this point would come, and I told myself not to get into an argument, but she just kept coming at me, so I talked back. And I told her we can take this up to HR, so we can clarify what my expectations are for this job. She got confused, and actually said \"what are you talking about HR? I'm your boss\". And then she left it at, \"we'll talk about this with our franchise owner\".\n\nNot really sure what to do at this point? Feels like I am now a target. I don't think this will improve, and I don't think taking this up to HR will fix anything. I can already see from their point of view, it's easier to just fire me than discipline her, because she is in a highly trained, skilled position, requiring extra degrees.\n\nBesides the obvious looking for another job, what can I do in the meantime to stay afloat? How do I deal with her constant hostility and underhanded remarks?",

Recently I applied for a role there that was similar to what I did back then, only now it is a Director role instead of Sr. Manager with eleven direct reports (vs just a few).\n\nThis is at a Fortune 10 company, yet the pay for the role is apparently not much higher than what I made a decade ago. Prices since then are up around 36%, and that increase is only about 14%. So in real terms I would actually be making less now with way more responsibility and experience.\n\nI walked away from the phone call today feeling defeated. I do not know if I will ever be able to catch up, even after having what most people would consider a successful career earlier in my life. It feels like I have been running in place for 10 years, working harder for less.

      "selftext": "https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/how_social_media_brings_out_the_worst_in_us\n\nSocial media maximizes hate, creating a cycle of distraction and dependency that benefits platforms but undermines users’ well-being.\n\nJill Suttie explores how journalist Nicholas Carr’s warning that social media, far from fulfilling its promises, often degrades our thinking, relationships, and civic life. Carr’s book Superbloom traces how communication technologies from the telegraph to the smartphone were celebrated as tools of connection, but frequently produced disconnection and harm.\n\nOne central problem is the sheer speed and scale of online communication. \n\nSocial media encourages constant updates and reactions, which overloads our minds and weakens deep, reflective thought. \n\nUnder these conditions, people rely more on stereotypes and gut reactions, fueling misunderstanding and polarization rather than empathy or consensus.\n\nCarr also notes how platforms exploit two basic human instincts. Our “seeking instinct” keeps us scanning endlessly for new information, while our “social instinct” makes us crave feedback and approval. \n\nRelationships, too, are distorted. Online exchanges often involve oversharing without the gradual trust-building that real friendships require. While users may feel superficially connected to many, those bonds remain shallow. \n\nFor younger generations in particular, this contributes to anxiety, loneliness, and depression, as social media becomes entwined with self-image and self-worth.\n\nSuttie emphasizes that quitting altogether may be unrealistic. \n\nInstead, Carr suggests a cultural reset: redefining norms around availability, setting personal boundaries on notifications, and practicing mindful consumption. \n\nAt a policy level, stronger regulations could counteract the incentives that drive platforms toward manipulation and harm.\n\nUltimately, the article concludes, social media will not disappear but if we are intentional, we can limit its power to bring out our worst and reorient it toward healthier forms of connection.\n\nSo antiwork what do you think?\n",

It's more like \"I SUPPLY what I want to in order to keep my fortune afloat and DEMAND you to use and/or buy it. I will use my influence in DC & Wallstreet to do whatever it takes to ensure my DEMANDS meet my SUPPLY.\"\n\nOne big example of this is what has been happening with this ridiculous 100% return to office push since trump signed his EO mandating it for feds. The demand for crappy ass, energy guzzling (both human energy and utility energy) office buildings is not there...especially in today's digital age, there is absolutely no reason to keep huge footprints of these kinds of buildings throughout American cities. People don't need to be held prisoner this way anymore.\n\nThere are plenty of other options to reuse buildings or build new beautiful places that people actually want to be at, but the real estate moguls don't want to spend money on this shifting demand and repurpose their buildings because it's their money...yea right, you kidding!?!?!...they don't want to do that.

      "selftext": "So.. this is my third 'real' job. I've had more jobs while I was at school/studying, but since I ended school this is my third. Was burned out and very depressed after the first one, was sick for two years. Got my shit together through therapy, medication, dropping some friends etcetera. Got to work again, it was a shit environment where I almost got sick again. Found a new job (my current job) and it seemed all fine at first. Just a job. Some annoying people but nothing big. Also some nice people. Work was fine, workload was fine, pay was fine. I was content. \n\nWe had a reorganization (idk if this is the right word in English) a couple months ago, I got a new manager and some new colleagues and it's been shit AGAIN. We are severely understaffed, the manager and assistant manager don't listen to me and my colleagues about the fact that there's too much work. Several people are on sick leave (for weeks or months) and they refuse to hire new people. Why? Nobody knows. I work for the government (not USA) so there's no profit. The director gave permission to hire two new people months ago. But they still haven't even started the process of trying to find new people. And it's not that it's difficult to find people for these positions. It's not rocket science.\n\nThe whole team is unmotivated, we (mostly) hate each other, hate management. People do what they want basically and the manager is a spineless prick that doesn't even supervise. I have a workload that's supposed to be for three people. Some days there is no one there for those tasks and I have to pick up the shit when I'm back in on Tuesday (I work 4 days a week). I have nightmares about work, about colleagues being mad at me, an overloaded mailbox (which happens frequently). I have had benzodiazepines from the doctor to deal with the stress, but that's a short term solution. I started smoking again. And I'm just overall not enjoying life. Any free time I have, I'm just resting and charging my battery for the next week of work. \n\nToday I 'called in' (we have to text our manager) sick. And went back to sleep. ONE hour later, the prick called me apparently. I was asleep. When I woke up (about 30 minutes after he called me) I called him back and he asked how I was doing. I said that I wasn't doing well. He asked me, annoyed, 'what does that mean??'. Well it means that I'm not coming in, asshole. But I felt pressured and I told him what I'm sick with. Which he doesn't need to know, and can not ask about according to the law (in my country). After that he shared with my colleagues what I have... Which is A) not cool and B) a violation of my privacy. My colleagues don't need to know what I have. All they need to know is that I'm not coming in. Period. \n\nI am so done with incapable, asshole managers. But what other option do I have? I can look for a new job, that whoooole process of applying and getting rejected 80 times before you find one that turns to shit again after a couple of months, if that. And then just keep doing the cycle over and over again until you die or until your soul is so crushed that you don't care anymore? ",

I do have a 2 minute time window before they happen. During these, I cannot move my arms or legs, my vision goes away/fuzzy and I have a staring spell I can't snap out of (i've had a few EEG scans my neurologist confirmed they're small seizures)\nAnd she gives me the biggest attitude. \nI page her and i say \"I feel a small seizure coming on I need to sit down\"\nShe fucking rolls her eyes at me and doesn't let me sit down most times. \nSometimes, customers ask if i'm okay, and I tell them exactly what's gonna happen and when and the managers name that won't let me sit down.\nBut I can't fucking control it. Does she think I like having these every day?! At work?! ",

      "title": "I wrote a short blogpost about burnout and overworking in America.",
      "selftext": "I hope this isn’t against the rules but I just wanted to share this. I wrote a short blogpost about burnout called Clocking Out and I was wondering if I could get some feedback on it.\n\nClocking Out\n\nThe clock on the wall had barely ticked past six-thirty when my supervisor stopped me on my way out. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, the warehouse air was stale from a day already too long. He told me that for future reference, I can stay a little later to “get more done,” and even assured me that I wouldn’t get in trouble for the extra overtime. He said it like he was doing me a favor. What he didn’t realize is I had already given the day eight and a half hours, and the last thing I wanted to do was give it one more. I told him that it wasn’t about the overtime, I just wanted to go home. He looked at me confused and asked, “Well what do you do after work that makes you have to leave at six-thirty on the dot every day?” As if I needed a reason. The truth is, I don’t need to have plans to want my own time. Whether I’m seeing friends, doing errands, or scrolling on my phone, those few hours at night is some of the only moments I get to myself. The fact that I have to justify that to my boss says everything about the culture we live in: one where we are expected to explain why we want time to ourselves, where working to the point of burnout is treated like a badge of honor, and where happiness comes second to productivity.\n\nThat question stuck with me after I walked out the door. What do I do after work that makes me want to leave? It wasn’t that I didn’t have an answer, it was that I started to realize how little my personal life mattered to the multi-billion dollar company I worked for. The truth is, most nights I don’t do anything that sounds impressive. I make dinner, run errands, go to the gym, and if I’m lucky I’ll see a friend or two before going to bed and starting it all over again. But isn’t that the point? My time outside of work isn’t supposed to be a productivity contest, it is my time to relax and do what I want to do. Why is it that so many people can feel like their time is only valued when they are selling it to someone else?\n\nIn America, working long hours is almost seen as a marker of success. Our society celebrates rugged individualism and capitalism to the point where it seems like any time you're not being productive is a waste. It’s normal to brag about not using vacation days or working sixty plus hour weeks as if burnout is a badge of honor. Online, influencers and “self-improvement” gurus  tell teenagers that real ambition looks like sleepless nights, endless side hustles, and constantly pushing themselves to a point of exhaustion. This is then usually followed up by a shameless self promotion for their two hour dropshipping course. The glorification of overwork will also seep into the way your bosses talk to you. Managers will dangle empty promises of promotions and raises, using the illusion of reward to make employees want to work harder. \n\nAt a job I had not too long ago, during the “morning pep talk” I had a manager say that she saw us more than she saw her own family, which is why we needed to think of ourselves as a team. I remember sitting there and thinking how dystopian that sounded. A young woman with a husband and child at home presented this fact as something inspiring. This is something you see all the time in the media; these late-stage capitalism horror stories repackaged as a heartwarming fluff piece. A real headline from ABC News reads “110 sick days donated to teacher whose 1-year-old is fighting cancer.” Another headline reads “Homeless man holds sign ‘Hungry For Success,’ hands out resumes.” These institutional failures are being sold as a celebration of humanity but ultimately it allows a flawed system off the hook.\n\nWhile countries like Denmark, the Netherlands, or Norway are much smaller and operate under different systems, their shorter work weeks and higher quality of life are examples that productivity and rest can coexist. Yet in the United States, that balance is harder to find without fear of economic failure or cultural pushback. Even federal holidays will spark debates that put politics and prejudice over having a paid day off. The recognition of Juneteenth had people so up in arms and it really showed how cultural division can overshadow a day of leave. It makes systemic changes like four day work weeks feel like a pipe dream, even considering the proven benefits for employees and employers. \n\nWith large scale changes like shorter work weeks so out of reach, the smaller victories are what people hold onto. Clocking out at the end of a long day doesn’t fix everything. What it does do is draw a satisfying line of where your time belongs to you. Most working class Americans put in long hours to keep things running for themselves or their families, juggling jobs, bills, and other responsibilities. Getting a break to focus on meaningful activities shouldn’t be a luxury, it should be a standard. In 1659, Welsh writer James Howell coined the proverb “all work and no play make Jack a dull boy.” The importance of downtime isn’t anything new, so why does it feel like we’ve forgotten?\n\nSo the clock hits six-thirty. I punch out, go home, and the rest of the day is mine. It feels like stepping out of one world and into another. The sound of supervisors, customers, and pointless tasks can't reach me. I watch a movie, I scroll my phone, I spend time with people I care about. It’s no proof of ambition or hustle, it is just mine. In a culture that can try to measure my worth by productivity, maybe the most radical thing I can do is use my time to live without justification. In those ordinary hours there is a sense of calm that I always look forward to, a reminder that life is more than the sum of the hours that I punch in.  \n",

I'm not entirely anti-work, but I really don't like toxic work cultures. I am anti-THAT kind of work.\n\n\\- I've received different instructions from different people who \"trained\" me. The manager and owner of the shop admitted on the first day that she's not good at training, so she asked my colleagues to do it. I had received instructions that were not up to her standards when she watched me do it. And of course, she thinks it's my performance issue rather than my colleagues' problem, who have been there for a long time and built a rapport with her.  \n\\- By day 3, I'm not encouraged to ask questions anymore, and I'm made to feel like it's a nuisance if I do. Mind you this is after only 8 hours of working there, and within those 8 hours, most of the time was used for cleaning and preparation tasks with barely any training for other stuff. Also, side note: I swear every single colleague had asked me to clean the washroom. It's clean and they'd still make me do it. Is this a culture thing I'm missing? I'm used to having a schedule and taking turns cleaning the bathroom & doing the dishes, not the \"new person does the cleaning\".  \n\\- I have barely received feedback regarding how I could improve my performance. Instead, it's discussed \\*loudly\\* in their own language (I can understand Korean although I'm a foreigner, so I know it's about my performance).\n\nI have tried to mention to the manager that I need feedback because each workplace has their own rules and do things differently, but still, minimal feedback, INCLUDING something I thought was important for me to know, a mistake with the order slip placement resulting in supposedly a late/cancelled order (what the manager claims). Although, she only told me about that incident after I confronted her about the issues and decided to not continue, so who knows if there are evidence or receipts on whether that was my mistake or not.\n\nI hope I am not crazy for expecting proper training and sufficient feedback, at least in the first week or even first few weeks of work.\n\nAfter I decided to quit, she said that everything was wrong with my performance and attitude (with no grounds to back it up), the only thing supporting her statement being apparently \"ALL\" the employees have complaints. Also, this was the only time when she mentioned order mistake.\n\nI always find constructive criticism to be extremely helpful, since nobody is good at everything when they start up. But keeping complaints behind my back, pretending like everything is okay, not giving feedback or support and not informing me on mistakes... That is just toxic.\n\nJust posting here so you guys can tell me your experiences and also feel like you're not alone.",

Sometimes that might be anywhere from 5:53 and the latest I've stayed was 6:40. \nMy boss told us we can't do overtime unless we fill out a sheet and it gets approved by the director. So what has been happening is I will clock in at 5:53, leave at 6:30 for example, and my clock in time will show I got there at 6:30! Like I was late! They are changing my clock ins and not paying me for me work!? That seems unfair af, what can and should I do or who should I call? Thanks for any advice. ",

What's minimum wage in your state? \n\nFederal minimum wage is currently only $7.25/ hour. \n\n$25/hour by the end of 2025 isn't an unreasonable ask.\n\n Not getting your holidays off? Take them.

      "selftext": "This post is on behalf of my wife. She’s 29 and has been working at a supply chain company in Canada for about 3 years. Recent events at her workplace were the final straw that broke the camel's back, and she’s decided to quit for good. At this point, she’s basically quiet quitting until she leaves.\n\nContext:  \nHer office is a small 15-person operation that’s part of a much bigger supply chain company in North America. A few years ago, they acquired a smaller business, and since then my wife has been the sole point of contact for that site with no backup. After the takeover, most of the original staff either quit or retired because of the her company’s practices. So now she’s doing the work of 3 to 4 people, with no raise or recognition.\n\nShe’s regularly forced to work unpaid overtime and somehow that is the accepted culture in her company. She finally told the company she needed either a significant raise with a promotion, or more staff to handle the workload. They chose the latter option and decided to hire 1 employee as her backup.\n\nShe was asked to shortlist some candidates from the pile of applicants and conduct interviews of the suitable candidates along with her bosses, and she recommended a few solid candidates. But her bosses rejected them with comments like:\n\n* They’re too young (24 to 27 years old).\n* They have bounced around from company to company after every 2-3 years.\n* They have Master’s degrees, and people with Master’s always leave for better opportunities. (My wife has a Master’s degree, by the way.)\n\nThey rejected 4 suitable candidates and are still conducting interviews but have removed my wife from the interview committee ever since. Now every candidate they’re interviewing is 45+ and has stayed at their last company for 10+ years. The problem? This job doesn’t need 30 years of experience, a fresh graduate could handle it with few weeks of training. \n\n\n\nSome facts about her colleagues:\n\n* The average age in her office is 53.2 years and 55.1 years excluding her.\n* Most of them have been in the same role for 20+ years with no title change.\n* 4 out of 15 are in their 60s. The company also has a very high turnover rate for anyone under the age of 35.\n* At the office Christmas party (where partners were invited), a few colleagues went on a rant about how young people “can’t be trusted as employees.” They said this right after I mentioned I’d worked for 3 employers over my 7 year career.",

      "selftext": "\nHi Reddit. I just need to get this off my chest, and maybe get an outside perspective.\n\nI'm 23 year's old was recently fired from a job I really cared about. The official reason?\n\n> “Too many sick leaves, poor communication with the team, and swearing.”\n\n\n\nBut none of those things were major issues until recently — and I always did my job well, stayed in headphones most of the day, and only missed work because my toddler (2 y.o.) was sick and I had to stay with him. It’s not like I disappeared without explanation.\n\nBut here’s what I just found out after I was fired — and it hit me like a truck.\n\nTurns out, my team lead (M, let’s call him \"Jake\") is in a relationship with a colleague (F, \"Hanna\") who’s older than him and extremely possessive. I’ve always tried to keep my distance from everyone, just staying focused on work, but apparently she thought I was “a threat” — romantically. For what it's worth, I never had any interest in Jake. Never flirted, never gave any signals.\n\nAccording to someone I trust who recently opened up (they knew everything but stayed quiet until now), Hanna pressured Jake to fire me out of jealousy.\nShe wanted me gone — and he made it happen.\n\nI was told that he said, quote: “I don’t care what others think, Linda (me) will not be working here.”\nThis was said despite the fact that others on the team disagreed with firing me. He even refused to assign mandatory performance scores to Hanna and two other people, just to protect her.\n\nSo now I’m out of a job — a good job — not because I did anything wrong, but because of office politics, manipulation, and a weak man doing his girlfriend’s dirty work.\n\nAnd what hurts the most?\nNobody in management said anything. Nobody asked questions.\nThe people who knew — stayed silent until it was too late.\nI was told only now, through my husband, by someone who couldn’t take the guilt anymore.\n\n\n---\n\nI want justice, but I don’t want to come off as “bitter” or “vengeful.”\nI’m angry. And I have a right to be.\nBut what can I even do? I don’t have direct proof, just a verbal confirmation from a teammate who asked me not to name them.\n\nDo I report this to HR?\nTo the director?\nDo I write an anonymous letter?\n\nWill it even make a difference?\nThey already got rid of me.\nBut I want them to feel the weight of what they did — even if only just for a moment.\n\nIf you’ve ever been in this situation, or have any advice, I’d be really grateful.\nBecause this was not a firing.\nIt was personal.\n\nAnd I’m done being quiet. \n\n",

When I was hired I was told my region has a high turnover rate  because my boss lives in the region and micromanages, which I thought was whatever because I’ve had micromanaging bosses before…but turns out the real reason is is because they are extremely incompetent.\n\nMy boss is a huge ideas person, constantly networking, coming up with new ideas, new questions etc. but they never know how to follow through. They seem to not understand the workflow of their own company and myself and other employees always get half information because we are all told parts of plans, or just given random things that are meant for another employee… mind you there are only 13 of us. \n\nWhat makes this worse is because I am in my bosses region I get way more attention from them rather than the other employees scattered across the state, so it always looks like I’m behind because my boss is legit always on top of me, when in reality everyone is always on zoom trying to figure out wtf my boss wants. \n\nIt feels extremely untenable and I don’t know what to do, honestly I want to quit but the money is extremely good and I was unemployed for 2 years before I landed this job.

However I am always scheduled for 40 hours every week. The pay is terrible and I work twice as hard as most of my co-workers. \n\nOn the plus side my managers all like me. On the downside, they like me because I'm a pushover. I'll work like a dog, take on extra hours, occasionally skip breaks, and do whatever jobs. Our team is a bit hit or miss. We'll almost never get all our jobs done for the day, and every single night someone will call in sick, or do a no-show, so we're always down on hours. When ever this happens, I'm one of the ones who always has to pick up the slack.  I'll end up staying late, so we get everything done.\n\nMy managers all try to take advantage of me and everyone else they can buy using emotional blackmail. I have had coworkers tell me the managers have previously approved days off, scheduled them to work those days anyway, and then when it's brought to their attention, act like they're doing some big favour by moving the shift. Saying things like \"I can move that shift on Friday if you work Saturday instead. Since I did you a favour, you'll help me out, right?\" Shit like this is constant and annoying. But most of us are too nice to say no. I'm am getting sick of it honestly. But I have no way to address it at work. I understand these managers have a lot of pressure from higher ups, but it shouldn't be on me to solve their issues.\n\nJust recently as well, one of the new managers was asking if I wanted a full time contract with work hours every single weekend. I work most weekends anyways but putting that in a contract would mean I would never have a free weekend where I'm not expected to be at work. And it's not like I could ask for a weekend off if it's in my contract, because it's almost impossible to cover a 3 hour shift on a Saturday night, let alone the 7 or 8 hour shift I'd be expected to work.\n\nAs for my personal life, I suffer from anxiety and depression and lately I can't get anything done during the days because I'm tired and burnt out, and anxious about going to work again... And since I haven't been getting a regular schedule, my ADHD is out of control, which means I have no structure or motivation at all. Sometimes, I consider myself lucky to live alone so I don't have to burden family with my sluggish, lazy depression...\n\nTldr; I'm so tired of managers acting like a friend until they need something from me. And then it's all emotional blackmail with no consideration for my own needs and feelings. I'm not a slave. And I burn out quicker than most people because of mental illness. ",

A future where we all deserve a liveable wage is just a baseline demand.

I dont have all the answers nor do I know if I am proposing this in the best way, but I figured I'd put my message out there. And continue doing so. And if other were to talk about a collective strike all over the country, our unity can be a step forward in a future that benefits all, not just a few. \n\nAny comments and discussions are welcome.

People will work grueling hours and deny themselves things they want towards the idea that when they're 60, 70, whatever, that they'll be set for life.\n\nThat feels.... I dunno, frankly depressing? What about all the things that you want to do now that you won't be able to do when you're old? I'm not saying old people can't do fun things, but there are simply certain things you're gonna age out of or won't be available then. Traveling can be taxing, you won't get another shot at going to that big concert, you might not have the physical ability to pursue the same hobbies.\n\nAnd depending on how the world changes in that time, the measures you took might not even be enough. You could trade away all your time and money and still not have enough to retire. You might not even make it to retirement age, as macabre as that is.\n\nMaybe I'm just jaded, but trading your present happiness for theoretical comfort in the future doesn't make sense to me, especially in the present when the rich are still trying to take away what little we still have.",

I was out of work for like 5 days (missed 3 shifts). Had to use some of my PTO, cause I couldn't afford to not get paid.\n\n4: Today, I think I have covid or the flu. Taking a test later today.\n\nThe policy is if you call in 3 days in a row, you need a doctors note. Ok, so that's what I always do. I give doctors notes. \n\nAnyways, I let my boss know (through text) that I won't be in today and will be taking a covid test. He messages me back stating that I've called out a lot and requested a lot of time off recently. Saying it's impacting the team. Also, that the doctors notes doesn't excuse the absence. What the fuck? Then what are the notes for? To waste my doctor's time???\n\nAs for the time off request, when I request time off, it's either for appointments, plans, or trips. The last few times they happened to fall back to back. I guess we can't enjoy our lives now? The managers can't give set schedules either. We have to have open availability. So I always put in a request to ensure that I have that time off, especially if it's important or has been planned for a long time.\n\nWhat's frustrating is that I'm just now finding this out. I've been here for 6 months! No one has told me any of this about the doctors note thing. I've realized that they are REALLY bad with communication at my job. This isn't the first time this has happened.\n\nAlso, I made a post about this boss already (check my page if you want). Another reason why I'm trying to leave this place. It's very disorganized sometimes. \n\nEdit:\n\nI get where some of y'all are coming from, but I can't control when I get sick. Also, I'm not revolving my life around this job that treats me poorly. Sorry, not sorry.\n\nEdit 2: \n\nOk, someone pointed out that you guys might think I work a regular 9-5. Let me give y'all context. \n\nI work at a hotel as a cook. We are open 7 days a week, and I'm scheduled 36-40 hours a week. My schedule changes every week. Managers aren't allowed to give out set schedules. Which is why I request so many days off.",

      "selftext": "I’ve been thinking about this a lot lately. On one hand, I completely understand that businesses exist to make profits. AI offers efficiency, reduced costs, and scalability, so it makes sense that companies are adopting it rapidly.\n\nBut here’s what keeps bothering me: what happens if everyone eventually loses their jobs to AI? If people don’t have proper jobs, they lose purchasing power. And if no one has the money to spend, then who will buy the products and services these AI-driven companies are selling?\n\nTraditionally, companies provided employment, which created a cycle: employees earn money → they spend it on goods and services → they pay taxes → the economy grows. If AI takes over everything and the only ones benefitting are CEOs and shareholders, that cycle breaks. The wealth gap widens, fewer people contribute to taxes, and social systems start collapsing.\n\nSure, companies may show record profits in the short term, but in the long run, is this even sustainable? If the majority of people can’t afford to live decently, won’t the very foundation of consumer markets collapse?\n\nAre we heading towards a world where a handful of corporations and individuals get richer while the rest of society struggles just to survive? \n\nSeems like slowly governments are changing to Plutocracy where the wealthy individuals rule over the world ultimately. \n",

I have since moved on and am now working at a country club; where I feel respected, listened to, my disability is perfectly accommodated for, and people are able to communicate like adults. Plus, I make bank with tips.\n\nNeedless to say, I heard through the grapevine (I'm still friendly with several of my former coworkers) that the previous employer has allowed half of its staff to either resign or be transferred to different parks, instead of being outright fired. They are now badly struggling to find new employees.\n\nIt was a county job, though I'm going to keep identifying details as vague as possible.\n\nI remember when I first interviewed for that old job, I was told that they can't keep employees due to them \"not being able to keep up\", and now I get the sense that I missed a massive red flag.\n\nBetween toxic workplace practices, the racism, ableism, the ageism, poor communication, micromanaging, financial mismanagement, rivalries between department heads, and the park director actively protecting the toxic department heads, I am getting news from former coworkers about that the park is struggling badly. I'm honestly enjoying the show from afar.\n\nOne of the department heads (she was one of the good ones, a sweet old lady, and I hope she is doing better, wherever she is) even rage quit the job after getting her hours cut after coming back from an extended hospital stay, and sent in a scathing HR complaint to the county about the most toxic department head (for racism, ableism, and ageism). Even then, the park director still protects that toxic department head \"because she is a professional and we need her\", despite the HR complaint.\n\nSo in the end, I am utilizing my experiences there as both a learning experience, as well as a cautionary tale to others.\n\nHas anyone else seen this type of business practice of \"letting people go\"? Of allowing them to resign or transfer instead of outright firing them?\n\nEdit: Grammar and finer details",

I just think it’s insane and unethical to take your barista’s tips. \n\nI paid with a card and the tip screen on their point of sale has absolutely no mention that the tip money isn’t going to the baristas. I only noticed on the physical cash tip jar. I asked if they get to keep their credit card tips or do they go to the mission. And with a defeated, or possibly annoyed look (they probably get asked about this routinely) they said that it all goes to the mission. I chose to then not tip because as an atheist I’m not comfortable supporting a Christian mission. If I want to use my money to make an impact in my community there are plenty of ways to do so without dealing with a religion that is constantly used to harm people I care about. \n\nMy only question is that with them being a non profit I don’t know if this changes anything or if there’s some loophole or what, but aren’t the baristas legally entitled to their tips?

According to them, the workplace reported that I:\n\t•\tleave work early,\n\t•\tdon’t finish my jobs,\n\t•\tam always on my phone,\n\t•\tand even argue with people.\n\nNeedless to say, none of this is true. I take my role very seriously and have never behaved this way. The most frustrating part is that even though the people at the workplace know my work ethic and how I actually am, nobody is willing to step in to defend me—since I’m not their employee, just an agency worker.\n\nThe agency wasn’t supportive either. Instead, they issued me a formal warning and said if something like this happens again, I’ll be barred from service. This has left me constantly on edge at work, feeling like I have to tiptoe around, worrying that another baseless report could ruin my job. The stress and anxiety from this are really affecting me, to the point of feeling dizzy overthinking it.\n\nI’ve only been in the UK for 2 years, and honestly the job market feels brutal. It’s hard enough to find stability, but even when you work hard and do things right, it feels like you’re not appreciated—and sometimes, even punished unfairly.\n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation? How do you deal with unfair treatment from agencies or workplaces? Any advice on how I can protect myself, or even just words of encouragement, would mean a lot.\n\nThank you for reading.\n",

We’ve been gathering to figure out how to push back against these inhumane conditions, only for this guy, who’s also affected, to turn around and hand it all over to the same boss.\n\nWe confronted him and grilled him for two hours straight. He’s lost everyone’s trust in the office. At this point nobody cares, because most of us are planning our exits, but people like him (and the bosses who encourage this behavior) are the absolute worst part of workplaces.\n\n",

When my coworker saw me walk in he very loudly shouted \"-my name-, YOU'RE THREE HOURS LATE!\" And the other one gave me a nasty look and dropped the classic \"nice of you to show up.\". It was very embarrassing and I was quick to apologize. Again, I understand it is disrespectful to them to show up late to work but I don't think it was necessary for them to publicly call me out like that. If the roles were reversed I would take them to the side in private and ask me to explain myself. I am typically a few minutes early everyday and go out of my way to help these same coworkers. Am I in the wrong for feeling this way?",

You are not guaranteed any hours per fortnight but you are also not forced to work them. They then told me if you can’t make a Casual shift you’ve been given, you have to find your own coverage that Management won’t help you. I told them that’s also wrong, they should legally be helping you. It’s their job. \n\nJust wanted to vent!!

      "selftext": "My manager Morgan has been constantly micromanaging me so much recently. This may have happened because I sent her an email and CC’d her boss about how she didn’t have coverage for 30 minutes while I was working and so I was wondering if I can be compensated for staying past 30 minutes. Anyway, so we are a bus company. basically one day I had a 4 hour shift and I was by myself and it was so busy that I could not attend to calls because I had buses coming in, and I had a customers come in. She texted me asking why I was unavailable on calls and I explained how I was busy with the buses as well as customers. I told her that one of my buses came late, and I was tracking it on GPS which is why  I could not have been taking phone calls. Anyway so she then called me today and said I was lying about the buses being late but I have my co worker as a witness and the driver being a witness. She said she’ll be talking to her boss about me declining calls even though I explained it can happen when I cannot take a phone call because of a customer or something happens in the office because I work by myself most of the time. Some calls also drop by themselves and I can’t do anything about it. My co workers have said sometimes they decline calls too so I don’t understand. She said I meet the phone call metrics but is concerned about calls being declined. Anyway, what should I do? ",

      "selftext": "I got hired for a sales/administration kind of job after a gruelling post-university job search (and moving across the country). At first my days were busy learning the job, what I’m selling, software etc. but then it stagnated and I had weeks where I might’ve had an hour of work to do in my 8 hour work day. My supervisor nor any other departments had any work they could assign me, so I’d spend most of my day in my cubicle watching youtube or reddit. No one has said anything to me about it, and just said to enjoy not being busy because it will be so busy soon.\n\nOur busy season came around after about 5 months of this and I had lots to do, but now that it’s over I actually have less work than I did before. I actually will show up on Mondays with 0 emails in both my inbox and my team inbox. Today I genuinely had 1 email and a spreadsheet to update, took me about 5 minutes to do. This is actually beyond frustrating because even though I’m getting paid I’m not gaining any real experience to move to another job if I wanted to (this company is small and has basically no opportunities for growth unless someone quits). I’m currently applying for other jobs but that’s a task in of itself.\n\nUntil something pops up I’m kind of stuck here and I feel like I’m wasting my time and it’s setting my expectations for work very poorly. Should I take a shittier job like a call centre or just farm some time/experience until I can find something equivalent or better?\n\nTLDR; I’m being paid to do nothing and my bosses don’t care.\n",

The emotional rollercoaster of getting excited, imagining myself in the role and then having it all disappear is brutal + the time investment feels unsustainable when you're doing this with multiple companies...  \nI understand companies need to be thorough, but at what point does it become disrespectful to candidates time and energy? How do you protect yourself emotionally during these marathon processes? I'm starting to dread seeing \"next steps\" emails because I know it means more hours of unpaid labor with no guarantee",

      "selftext": "The last month I’ve wanted to just walk out once I saw my truck. But I waited till I had another job lined up. I dropped all my materials at the desk and told my managers I was done. I have been having  panic attacks, heart palpitations, and general anxiety and how my mental has been wrecked since June, mainly due to the stress of the job and being overwhelmed but also it was a stressful summer period. People told me I just needed a week off but I don’t think they really understand what it’s like to have these symptoms and see the truck as a trigger since you had your first panic in the truck. That’s just part of it.\n\nCan’t leave out how my manager forgot to pay me, after I had to take PTO for my son being born, and it was only 3 days PTO, since you don’t even accrue PTO till after a full year of employment. Or how I warned them I had a doctors appointment 5 days in advance just for them to put me on a full route the day of the appointment, then call me saying I should have put in a PTO request instead of “tell them last minute the day of”. Or the fact every day we leave at 9:30 but I had 7-8 10:30 delivery deadlines. When some of those stops had 10-20 boxes. Or how we don’t get an IRA of any sort but expected to carry boxes that weigh more than I do. Or how expecting you to walk their heavy ass packages down half mile driveways with cause there’s nowhere to turn around. Or how businesses provide nowhere to park but expect 6-8 boxes and don’t even offer to help carry them, just awkwardly watch you. Or how morning package handlers get food at the end of their shift and all we get is liquid IV’s. Or the time my trucks coolant reservoir blew up and I had to wait 2 hours for the mechanic. Or the time I got put in a truck that didn’t accelerate past 20mph (that video is posted here in this sub, yeah that was me) Or the time the truck you had alternator went out in the middle of winter so there was no heat, and you were told to check under the hood, then use a pen to push the gear shift bubble button cause the rubber cover tore. Or the time on your first day of work you get a truck where the e-Brake kept engaging on its own so you had to wait 2 hours for the replacement truck to come. If we call in sick we lose our $200 weekly bonus unless we have a doctors note. Or how one manager says 160 stops isn’t that much to do but when you ask if they’re run the route before they say I’ve never done any. That same manager tells you on your last day I understand you’re leaving but could’ve gave us a warning, “it’s not just about you, now we’re in a bind as a company” Well sir, I doubt you consider taking SSRI’s to feel more joyous around your family, or am seeing a therapist now, trying supplements so your heart doesn’t flutter or skip beats. My apologies. Plus how everyday you see people complaining how much we suck as workers and get shit on even if some of us are actual good workers.\n\nI think I got the point across. I wish yall the best. I used to love this job which seems funny. This was all off the top of my head what I could recall. Don’t let these people exploit you.",

      "selftext": "I’ve been thinking for a long time now about how so many people have corporate jobs, or jobs that are actually meaningless. It seems like such an unimpactful waste of time. Before you come for me, I AM one of those people currently, but I always think how the world would be a better place if people worked for causes and not meaningless jobs like sales for a product that really has no true value if you step back and think about life. How did we evolve to this? Doctors, conversationalists, non-profits, educators, etc at least move things in the right direction. Why am I stuck selling a platform to a corporate company that doesn’t even need it for a reason that is so meaningless?? I’m working on changing my career but in the meantime, there are so many useless corporations driving revenue that contributes to such trivial things in life. ",

      "selftext": "I'm a quality inspector, working in a factory that makes high volume productions, so thousands upon thousands of parts each day. It's my job to take a sample from bins and measure that sample of parts to make sure they match up to the blueprints. \n\n\nWe make a variety of parts, but I am to inspect one part in particular because it's going to be in high demand for the foreseeable future and we have 4 machines making it. Typically a sample size is 29 parts for me to do various measurements on with various tools. I've timed myself and it takes me about 40 minutes to do a batch of 29. That time has been pretty consistent for the 7 months I've worked here. \n\n\nThey recently implemented a third shift, so boss has been saying how there will be more of those parts than before. Now I've worked in quality for years and no place I have been to has *ever* given quality control a quota because that would go directly against what *quality* means. The machine operators get quotas because they ultimately care more about quantity, and vice versa for inspectors. So more parts doesn't really change my job at all except make more backlogged parts because I'm not gonna measure any more or less unless the specifications change. \n\nMy boss came up to me today with a coworker that has been here for longer than me, we'll call him Yarb. \n\n\"We're gonna have you work with Yarb today so he can show you what he does and possibly teach you any shortcuts because he is our fastest inspector. We'll have a lot more of these parts soon, so we don't expect you to get to his production but just to catch you up a bit\"\n\nI smile and nod along and when boss leaves, Yarb just tells me he does 10 pieces from each bin and still catches bad parts.  This rubbed me the wrong way because it shows that management either has no clue how we are inspecting our parts or they don't care. Anything but hire more inspectors ig (I'm the only one on second shift). Now I have mentally checked out of this job a while ago and already kind of do what Yarb told me he does, but I wanted to keep the timing realistic, because bossman can see how long we spend on each batch, so I would usually be on my phone or doing other things while my 40 minutes timer ran.\n\n\nMy production has come up before and when I actually got my numbers up, they asked me what I did. I figure they'll probably ask me again once they see that I am more than doubling my old production. I like Yarb, we're cool, but I feel like telling them what he 'taught me' would be throwing him under the bus. I want to bring up that the attitude this company has towards quality control is skewed and warped and Yarb's tips are a prime example, but I hate that I would have to tell on him to do so.\n\nAm I caring too much about this?",

      "selftext": "So, I wasn't sure where else to post this. But it's a bit of a story from my new job.\n\nI have recently started working for the Mars candy company. I go to retail locations and check their stock and help them stay stocked up, as well as offer the new products coming out. During my training the first two weeks, I was put with two different trainers (one for each week). The training was going smooth and I was picking up the lingo and how to use the system fairly easily. What I didn't expect was a response to the question \"So what's your favorite candy?\"\n\nWhen asked that question from the first trainer I didn't hesitate to say reeses. I grew up with it so it has a nostalgic value in my life and has always been my favorite. My co worker said \"Yikes, don't let the uppers hear you say that.\" I laughed, obviously liking the competitions candy can be seen as \"traitor\" but I thought it was a joke. Until the second week with my new trainer.\n\nSame thing, learning new things, picking it up quick, then asked the question again. \"What's your favorite candy?\" This time, I hesitated and answered a little different. I told her it's hard to pick, but I have three I'd consider my top, in order of what I like most to least would be Reeses Fast Break, Milky Way, and 100 grand. I get the response \"Reeses? Really? Their peanut butter is so fake, though. Have you tried our Snickers peanut butter? It's much better.\" I stared for a second and chuckled awkwardly before being honest again and saying \"Yeah, I actually have a case at home. But if I'm honest, it's no where near as good. Reeses has the best peanut butter in my opinion, and I've always loved it. But I still like plenty of Mars products.\"\n\nShe then proceeded to tell me for 10 minutes how I can't like Hershey products because they are bad, and the company is going under, and blah blah blah. This woman was a DIE HARD Mars candy fan. It caught me way off guard to the point I was worried my manager will ask and I'll be fired for saying Reeses! Now I don't necessarily believe it would actually happen, but some of these people seem brainwashed to believe if it dosnt come from Mars, it's not good. I asked my friend about this (he got me this job) and he told me that a lot of people in the company are essentially die hard Mars now and a bunch of wackjobs.\n\nAnyway, I'm very much enjoying the job so far and it's the most relaxed job I've had (make my own schedule and drive around). Other than the training, it's been a good choice. Thanks for reading the story if you did. If it dosnt belong here, I understand if it gets removed.",

      "selftext": "Hello, I apologize in advance for the low quality post and possibly being harshly off topic. If there is a better subreddit to ask this question, please let me know.\n\nI should start by saying that I do strongly believe in socialism, but as an American college student I want to meaningfully provide to society, and I feel such guilt for not putting enough effort into achieving a \"high-class\" job while my parents are putting thousands of dollars forth for me to pursue higher education, as they have worked endlessly to migrate from post-socialist Bulgaria to the US.\n\nAll high-paid white-collar jobs seem to thrive on exploiting their consumers by overpricing their services - such as law or medicine. My current goal is to become an environmental engineer so that I can provide to the environment while maintaining a \"practical\" job. However I can't say that I am too interested, and in fact it seems as if I'd only be allowing capitalism to remain as unsustainable as it is by delaying the destruction of the biosphere, instead of letting us feel the effects of our actions. I see how that can be inflammatory since less developed areas are more harshly impacted yet the concept has truth to it. Theoretically I would not be repairing the developed world with \"sustainable technology\".\n\nBecause of this, I wish I could take up another pathway. Yet, even if I could be involved in something such as healthcare, it seems that I'd still be facilitating exploitation carried out by the healthcare and insurance systems throughout the US.\n\nI do have to decide soon, yet I feel much too stupid and naive to make a healthy decision. I was hoping that someone with similar viewpoints could offer any insight. Again, I apologize if this is the wrong place to ask.\n\n",
