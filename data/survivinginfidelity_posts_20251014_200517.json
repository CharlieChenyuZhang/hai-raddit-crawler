      "selftext": "I am a 39-year-old man, in a 15-year relationship, and a father of two children (11 and 7).\nIn mid-July, my partner found a message on my phone, a text to arrange an appointment with a sex worker.\nThat moment shattered everything.\n\nI confessed everything to her. I have been addicted to porn and masturbation since I was a teenager, and since 2020, I have transferred that addiction to sex workers.\nI used to see them three or four times a year, while still watching porn almost every day.\n\nIt was my way to escape from stress, anxiety, failure, and emotional emptiness.\nI thought I was managing it, but I was actually trapped in a downward spiral.\n\nSince she found out, everything has fallen apart.\nShe moves between anger, disgust, and sadness, and she does not know if she wants to save our relationship.\nAs for me, I am facing shame and guilt, and trying to understand why I have been functioning like this for 20 years.\n\nWe still live under the same roof to protect our children and to see if rebuilding is even possible.\nI have been seeing a therapist since this summer. I have stopped watching porn and masturbating, and I am trying to replace those habits with sport, meditation, reading, and writing.\nIt helps, a little.\n\nBut as time goes by, she seems to drift further away.\nShe tells me she cannot picture a future with me anymore, that she no longer recognizes me.\nI understand, I betrayed her, both physically and emotionally.\nBut this realization has been an electric shock. I never want to live in lies again.\n\nIt feels like I am 40, dealing with a teenager’s problem, dissociating instead of facing reality.\nIt started years ago when I lied to everyone about my “studies,” while secretly drowning in porn and video games.\nAnd even as an adult, with a stable life and family, I rebuilt the same pattern of avoiding my fears and hiding behind a “perfect” façade.\n\nNow I see the damage: a broken woman, a fragile family, and a huge emptiness inside me.\nI do not know if she will ever forgive me.\nI am fighting not to collapse, to stay the course, and to show that I can truly change.\n\nI cannot talk to anyone about it, since she does not want to be judged or exposed to others.\nSo I am writing here to share a bit of this burden and to hear from others, to get advice, perspectives, and experiences.\nI want to understand, to move forward, and never repeat this destructive pattern again.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this.",

I know too many details about the life of a woman I met once, a year or more ago. We have always had an open phone/open book policy.  I’d gotten into his phone 5 weeks ago to get his most recent lab results so I could research what they meant.  There is something our primary is worried about that he’s been sending my husband to different specialists for. His phone was on messages when I opened it. I noticed that the person he talks to the most was not in his top messages.  I recovers his deleted and saw he’d been flirting hard.  This is crossing a boundary for us.  Since then, he’s done nothing but lie about no longer being in contact with her. He will tell me he’s not. But it’s not true. Last night we drank a lot.  I had a feeling like we always do, am I right? And he forgot to delete his messages at all. I saw that she said she knows he is married but that he said it’s not love, and I saw that he said to her he’s never cared about anyone the way he does for her despite never getting physical.  Their texts became suggestive and then sexual.  I know she has stopped talking to him. She told him she doesn’t want to hurt their respective spouses.  She said she wanted to work on her marriage and she felt he should do the same. He’s been sad all day.  I know he is mourning the loss of that relationship. How long will this last? Will we ever get past his betrayal and grief over losing her back to her husband? I just want us to be okay and I’m worried it is not possible.",

      "title": "My wife was caught in what I believe to be a technically impossible lie about her AP. Am I losing my mind?",
      "selftext": "I’m hoping to get some perspective here because I feel like I'm being driven crazy by a situation that should be black and white. I feel like I'm being gaslit again, but I'm to the point where I don't know anymore. \n\nBackground: D-Day was in March of this year. It's been about 7 months of a very difficult attempt at reconciliation. The biggest issue has been a lack of full transparency and honesty from my wife.\n\nThe Recent Incident: This past weekend it was my wife’s birthday. I had a gut feeling something was off. Later, I checked our detailed phone bill online and saw she had received a text from her affair partner (AP) that afternoon. When I had asked her directly if she'd had any contact with him that day, she had looked me in the eye and said no.\n\nThe Confrontation: I confronted her with the proof from the phone bill. Her immediate defense was that she had his number blocked, and she had no idea how a message could have possibly come through. She claimed it must be a phone glitch. She has a Samsung Galaxy phone. \n\nI'm fairly tech-savvy, and this sounded wrong to me. I've since done a deep dive and have confirmed with nearly 100% certainty (unsurprisingly, Gemini has detailed insight into how Android works) that on her type of phone (Samsung/Android), it is technically impossible for a standard SMS or RCS message from a blocked number to be delivered. The block is at the operating system level. It’s not a glitch.\n\nWhen I presented her with this fact, she restated that she had him blocked and thought it must be because he was still in her contacts.  However, contacts just address a text field to the number. It doesn't affect the block list.\n\nThe Core Issue:\nI am stuck on this. The issue isn't even the single birthday text anymore. It's the blatant, provable lie and the subsequent apparent gaslighting.  She is presenting what appear to be fabricated, false technical excuses to avoid admitting a simple truth: the number wasn't blocked.\n\nEither he was never blocked, or he was blocked, she unblocked him and let him know that she was available, and then she reblocked after the exchange. What also doesn't help matters is that he was listed under the name of a coworker. She saw me search for his name, but then I'm sure I surprised her when I did a search for his phone number and it popped up as [female coworker]. \n\nShe had admitted about 4 weeks ago that the affair had continued and had told me that it was now over. They always chatted via WhatsApp and that was deleted. There are no other communication apps on her phone, and if they were communicating another way, I don't think they would have used SMS.\n\nThat said, most of the messages were historically sent via RCS which doesn't show up in the phone bill online. However SMS does, and this one message on her birthday happened to be SMS for some reason. \n\nAny way, I feel like my sanity is being tested. I want to reconcile, but it feels impossible when my wife won't admit to a lie about the text message and blocking. \n\nMy Questions for you:\nHas anyone else dealt with this kind of \"technical gaslighting,\" where your partner denies what appears to be provable, black-and-white facts?\nHow do you move forward in reconciliation when your partner continues to lie about something so minor like \"It's your birthday, has he texted you?\" Is this a sign that she's not truly committed to the honesty required to heal? She claims up and down that she's telling the truth, and she SEEMS sincere, but this woman also had an affair for 7 months before I found out. \n\nA few items to add: \n1. We have marriage counseling tonight. I need to discuss this rationally. \n\n2. Our 24th anniversary is next week. \n\n2. She's taking a trip across the country in a couple weeks, and the AP is also supposed to be in the same location. He supposedly has no idea she will be there. \n\nTL;DR: Caught wife receiving a text from her AP. She lied about it. When shown the phone bill, she claimed he was blocked and it was a \"glitch.\" I have know this should be technically impossible, but she has me doubting myself. I feel like I'm going crazy. Is reconciliation possible? ",

No sex, but sleeping together in the same bed, cuddling (I read al the messages and the AP was complaining about my GF only wanting to cuddle), kissing.\n\nReason why it happend is that AP had a near death experience 2 months ago and that triggered something. My ex had stated that I have been perfect, the ideal partner and that she doesn’t get how this happened, that she loves me.\n\nI am a weak person. I love her so much that I am willing to look past this and forgive her. She is so dear to me, it’s incredible. I love her with all my heart.\n\nShe has asked for space, has been looking for a therapist and has been going to therapy. She is afraid of getting back together with me cause she is afraid of hurting me again.\n\nI wrote the following message to her:\n\n‘I just want you to know that even with everything that’s happened, I still love you so incredibly much. That hasn’t changed. \n\nWhat we’ve shared means a lot to me, and the love I feel for you is still very real.\n\nI understand you need time and space to figure things out, and I respect that. I’ll give you the space you asked for, because I want this time to actually help you find the clarity you need.\n\nPlease know that my love for you doesn’t stop because we’re taking a break. I’m still here, open-hearted and hopeful that when we both have more understanding, we can talk again about how to move forward.\n\nUntil then, I’ll be taking care of myself and quietly holding space for you. I hope your job interview goes well, I am rooting for you.’\n\nI need some support, people who have been in the same situation, I don’t know, just anything ",

      "selftext": "I need some advice on my long term, high school sweetheart relationship. I (27F) have been with my husband (26M) since we were 16 (11 years together, 2.5 years married). We’ve been best friends, gone through a lot of shit together. We lost our virginities to each other and I have only been with him. \n\nI found out a few months ago he cheated on me once in college and slept with someone else by him coming out and initiating being truthful. At that time, I also found out he’s been lying to me about a porn addiction and other things. But he wants to make it work. Because of how long it’s been and you know, we were kids- it hurts but I can get over that infidelity. He started seeing a therapist and is working on his demons. \n\nFast forward to a month later, I found out he’s was having an emotional affair with a coworker by going through his phone. I almost left him but he begged me to stay because he knows he fucked up. But swears up and down there’s nothing physical and he’s just hates himself and was looking for attention elsewhere but working on being a better man to also be a better husband (I’m not going to lie- I had some toxic traits to work on aka ego fighter and shutting down and massive depression). This one hurts and I’m having a tough time forgiving this one but can see the active changes he’s making by the love and attention he’s giving me now vs our entire relationship. Told me there is nothing else he is hiding from me. \n\nFast forward to 2 nights ago, I found his Reddit page and he was commenting on girls posts a couple years back saying he wanted to have sex with them. When confronted, he said that he used to like to convince girls that he liked them but never went further than that. He knows it’s fucked up and he hates himself for it but he’s actively working with his therapist to stop all these stupid acts and betrayal. \n\nI am the most loyal person and this fucking kills me that this has happened probably countless times in the years I’ve been with him. I’m not sure I can ever trust him when he hasn’t ever fully been transparent and I’ve had to find things out on my own. But otherwise we are now able to communicate better, working on our relationship since the start of this, and have just bought a house together this year. I just don’t know if I’ll ever be able to trust him and if he will ever change, even though he’s doing the work to change now. We just started marriage counseling but only 2 sessions in and right now I’m so emotionally withdrawn I’m not sure if I can ever move past this… TIA for any advice…",

Sometimes it's still strange to think that he remarried his ex wife(It's a long story. To make a long story short, he hid the fact that he was married and dated me, also he remarried the same woman.), and that they were married for ten years. It’s baffling that a liar like him could maintain a marriage for so long and that his wife still considers him her best friend and spouse. Even after what I went through with him, I still find it strange how a single person can be so astonishingly different depending on the relationship. \n\nIt gives me a strange feeling to think about how someone who deceived me, dated me, and then coldly ended our relationship can maintain long-term relationships with his wife and friends. I loved him so, so much but it's still humiliating and infuriating that he deceived me and used me as a side piece. ",

We had a lot in common and shared exactly the same view of life. Everything was perfect, we moved together around 2 years later and we had a wonderful life and everything was perfect. She always had the dream of becoming a mother and wanted to become one at 20yo but I wasn’t ready. Life went on and in 2013 we decided that was the time to have a baby, we both had great jobs, stable life, plans etc. Our fist born came pretty quickly and we were really happy. In 2014 we were able to buy our home and things were really starting to look great for our family, a cosy place with a roof over our head, in a nice neighbourhood. With all of this, we wanted to have a second children, but this is where things started to look bad, nothing was working, we were sad and over the years we had lost faith in having a second child, but then, when we both let down the idea of having another child, our second daughter arrived and we lived a pretty standard life with friends, fun, holidays etc etc.\n\nNow fast forward to 2025, a couple months ago I was not feeling really well mentally, I had a couple panic attacks and anxiety and didn’t’ understand why, and something in my guts was telling me that something wasn’t right. Although we had a good life since then, my wife and I had a major flaw in our communication. We never spoke when something was wrong, even if our guts told us so, we never had the courage to stood up to our emotions and told the loved one what was wrong. When we tried we were both “closing the door” to the other and slowly turning into stone whenever problems were present.\n\nPersonnally, during those years from 2015 to now, I slowly drowned into my own self, telling myself that that was only a bad time, and as ever, things would slowly calm down by themselves and everything would be back to normal again. Boy I was wrong, I slipped into a version of myself that I truly hate, letting things go slowly, ignoring every red flags, intentionally or not, becoming nothing but a provider to my family and not really a husband or a father. I slowly lost my wife’s love, and we became sort of partner with sexual obligations. Everything screamed that it was wrong but by the force of habit, I kept going through life like that. I wasn’t able to cherish what I had, I wasn’t the husband I was before, I only provided stability and security to my family, which is great but I lost the only person I loved the most after my children, my wife, because I was blinded by my own selfishness.\n\nBack to my gut feeling, I managed to do some sort of introspection, and I wrote everything that was felling wrong inside my head. 2 pages of text, in random order. I sat with my wife and discussed it, hoping this would trigger the same sort of reaction, telling her that opening up to myself and to her was my way of starting to heal from myself. She heard and didn’t tell much, but I was happy to be with her and that she was supportive. Couple weeks after, I reiterated the exercise, we sat, discussed, still hoping to have an open discussion about what was on her mind, I wanted to work all the things that were not right in our marriage. I wanted to make her have the same reflection as I had about myself and work together to resolve our problems.\n\nThen it happened, 10 days ago she asked me to come in our bedroom to talk, we sat and she opened up, she started by telling me that she was not truthful with me and told me that she was not feeling anything anymore for me. No more love, nothing. We discussed a lot about why, what happened, what can we do about it ? We discussed about our feelings for the first time in years. I cannot explain in English how we came to the subject but I was telling her that honor and loyalty was the most valuable quality for me and that I would never ever do something to her that would broke our wedding vows. After saying that, I was welcomed by nothing but silence, and I knew. When she spoke, she told me the truth, all the truth. 6 years ago, before our second children, she cheated on my with y guy I don’t really know, she saw him for 3 months then everything stopped because it was only sex and nothing more.\n\nMy heart shattered, I felt that it has been opened up like a book, and left it like that, bleeding. I was devastated, completely lost, broken. I wasn’t able to be mad, I was in shamble, in pure emotions, sad, angry, bitter, disoriented. I left the house, took my shoes and a jacket and walked. Walked to exhaustion , It was the only way for me to clear up my mind, process the information, I was alone in the forest, I screamed, cried, walked, cried some more, for five hours.\n\nWhen I came back, we sat and discussed for a couple hours about how we arrived to this point, and what we would do now ? Considering the circumstances, I told her that I needed to leave the house, even the village, and start healing myself and rebuild myself so that she could do the same and be better parents for our children.\n\nBy healing ourselves, we will be able to become better parents to our children, even if it means that we have to live separately.\n\n \n\nTldr : My wife cheated on my because we never spoke about our inner problems and kept on burying everything that was wrong. Communication is key in a relationship and we forgot this.",

      "selftext": "\nI see so many posts on this sub that say something to the effect of “it never occurred to me that they were even capable of this.”  Or, “I never thought I’d be posting here.”  And when it’s all over they come away with the belief that they will never have a happy relationship, essentially because they have convinced themselves that it just isn’t possible to predict who will cheat, but that’s an assumption based on ignorance.  The signs were there, you just have to get better at recognizing them.\n\nAn event in someone’s past can be an exception — but a pattern is a person.\n\nWe are not defined by our excuses, intentions, or words; we are defined by the choices we make again and again.\n\nIf you want to understand who someone truly is, don’t listen to what they say — observe what they do over time. Patterns don’t lie. The longer the span of time you observe, the clearer their character becomes. Consistent behavior reveals more about a person’s nature than any confession, promise, or apology ever could.\n\nPay attention not just to what choices they’ve made, but how they’ve responded to those choices. Do they take ownership of their mistakes, learn, and evolve — or do they repeat the same behaviors, rationalizing them with stories of trauma or unfairness?\n\nGrowth is visible. So is avoidance.\n\nIf someone continually makes the same harmful choices despite years of consequences, it’s not circumstance — it’s character. That repetition exposes either a lack of self-awareness or a deliberate indifference to the impact of their actions.\n\nYou can focus on what your partner did one night three years ago, or you can examine who they’ve been over the last decade. Which do you think tells the truth?\n\nA single poor decision may reveal a moment; a consistent pattern reveals the person.\n\nWe all make mistakes. What matters is whether those mistakes form a cycle. The same poor decisions repeated over years become a self-portrait — the clearest predictor of who they’ll continue to be unless something truly transformative happens.\n\nWhen trying to understand a partner’s true character, conversations about their past can offer context, but their present behavior with you carries the greatest weight.\n\nYou need time — at least a year — to see the full picture: their habits, how they handle conflict, whether they learn or deflect, whether they build or destroy.\n\nCompare who they were before meeting you with who they are now. Have they broken patterns, or are they replaying them? Real change is rare, and it almost always follows a major reckoning — something painful enough to force true reflection.\n\nIf the patterns you see point toward traits incompatible with peace, trust, or happiness, you face a choice of your own: to hope for potential, or to accept reality.\n\nWisdom is recognizing when consistency is not a sign of reliability, but of refusal to grow — and having the strength to walk away, no matter how much you wish otherwise, regardless of all the ways they might make you feel good.",

I’m in my new place and it feels like a breath of fresh air and like finally I’m experiencing some peace. I love everything about my new place, I have a detached garage, so no more fighting/frustrations with parking. I love that I got to pick the area (bc he had pressured me to move in with him and it had to be in the area he wanted), I’m glad this space is all mine and I get to choose what I want for the apartment. Purple is my favorite color, so my shower curtain is purple, my comforter is purple, my bathroom rug is purple, I wish I could make it all purple. I’ve been going out prior to moving into this new place with some friends, and at one bar I met someone, we’ve been talking and I went on my first date. I was nervous about it, but I surprisingly had fun, I let the guy know I’m not open to anything serious and he was cool with us just going on dates and hanging out. Which I’m glad it didn’t turn out into anything awkward. Anyway, during the date, I realized how much I forgot the feeling of being looked at as, I guess interesting or desired. He kept smiling and saying, “You seem like a pretty and cool person”. I know I know, I probably sound like a gushing teen, but man it felt good to feel like I was seen as someone to pursue. Anyway, since moving to this new place, I’ve been more reflective and a little hopeful for my future. Way better than last month for sure, especially once I moved from that place. I hope everyone else is doing good in their journey, thanks for reading and have a good day. ",

We went back and forth a few times on it, I was very naive but learned a lot along the way, so no I’m not stupid enough to believe he was truthful in any way (He said he downloaded games he saw on adds and was misled into these apps, then deleted them when he realized). \n\nLong story short I wasn’t getting anywhere with him so I just told him I choose to move on and believe he regret it and will not repeat it…even if he didn’t admit it. (I have no proof of him talking with a real woman or meeting one) Well ofc since then his phone is clear, I honestly think I will never find anything in his phone again if he continues to cheat. He could keep a burner phone at work or whatever and I would never know. I was a mess because of the shock of it all and I regret how I let him get away with it so easily, he didn’t deserve it especially without an admission or apology. \n\nBut like wtf was I thinking? I went snooping with no plan on what I would do if I found something so I was caught off guard. I didn’t take my time to confirm if he ever talked to anyone or met anyone (small chance he used the apps for “browsing”). So now I will never know for sure and that doubt is not fading away at all. He had the nerve to make a joke about it a few days ago, mocking me on my Chatgpt use (It helped me know which ones were dating apps and what kind, for example the Ashley app looks all innocent until you look it up). He was quick to shut it down when I told him I fact checked everything the chat said and Im not one to be fooled by it. \n\nAnd yes he has been amazing since the “confrontations” for sure he’s not watching porn or onlyfans models anymore at least not on his phone because now he knows I have no shame to snoop it secretly. Fuck him and fuck me for letting it go without getting closure. It will eat me up for the rest of my life.",

We have a toddler, dog, and house together and have built what I thought was a great life for ourselves.\nI caught him cheating because his car displayed the last address he put in (a hotel) and I demanded to see his phone on the spot. I found a private text and grindr app where he had messaged and met up with a handful of trans fems over the span of several years. I also noticed some of these were at pivotal moments in our lives, such as right before our wedding or the birth of our child.\nI screenshot and sent many of the messages to myself. He swears he didn’t follow through with anything because he was too scared even though he attempted several times. I don't believe him because why should I? He also claims that there is nothing I did to cause his infidelity and that he knows he has a problem with porn that has gotten out of hand and made him want to get pegged. Over the last couple years, we explored prostate pleasure but he never asked for more than what we were already doing. He also started drinking heavily the past year so not sure if that made it worse. I told him that he needs to talk to a therapist and get a grip on who he is. I said maybe you're bisexual and can't commit to a monogamous relationship.\nThe discovery of his infidelity and lying (so many lies) is devastating to me but I would rather divorce and move on then try to change him into something he's not. I also want to do what's best for our child. If we can make it work then it would be best for our child but I'm so afraid of him cheating again once he gets bored and feels comfortable in 1, 5, or 10 years down the road?

I'm trying to be as amiable as possible because he is a good dad and I want him to remain in our child's life.\nLooking for advice if anyone has been in a similar situation.

      "title": "Struggling with trust and confusion after finding my husband’s Facebook history. I just need clarity. I’m feeling back and forth",
      "selftext": "Hi everyone,\nI’m feeling really lost and could use some kind and honest perspective from people who’ve been through trust issues in marriage.\n\nA few weeks ago, I noticed in my husband’s Facebook history that he had viewed over 100 women’s profiles and only about 10 men’s. When I brought it up, he said he wasn’t looking for anyone — that it was just boredom at work, scrolling while waiting for air compressors to fill or emails to send, and that sometimes he clicks on people’s profiles out of curiosity about comments on posts about fitness, parenting, or real estate.\n\nHe let me look through his Facebook history and said he wasn’t hiding anything, but when I cross-referenced it later, I noticed a few names were deleted. When I asked him about it, he listed everyone else except the one woman I was already suspicious of — someone we both know who works near one of his job sites and is known to be a swinger. When I pressed about her, he changed the subject, then said, “Yeah, her… I don’t know, I didn’t delete anything.”\n\nLater that night, after I explained what I’d learned about how Facebook history works (and that deleted searches would explain the missing names), he changed his story and said he probably did delete it because sometimes he goes into his recent searches and removes people if he gets tired of seeing their posts show up. And honestly, that does make sense — I just wish he had said that right away instead of denying it at first, because the change in story made it harder to know what’s real.\n\nNow I find myself even more confused. On one hand, his updated explanation actually lines up logically with what I found — so part of me feels like it might really be the truth. But on the other hand, I can’t shake the uneasy feeling that comes from the fact that he first denied it and only told the truth later. That inconsistency is what’s really sitting heavy with me.\n\nSince then, he’s been leaving his phone out and unlocked, almost like he’s trying to prove he has nothing to hide. I appreciate the effort, but it feels a little performative — like he’s trying to control my perception rather than address the deeper trust issue.\n\nHe’s been very affectionate and loving over the past year — even “over the top” sometimes — which makes this all more confusing. I love him deeply, and I know he loves me too. But when I get anxious or suspicious, he tends to pull back emotionally, which makes me feel like I have to keep my feelings to myself to keep the peace.\n\nI also want to mention that I do have a background of childhood abandonment, though I didn’t really struggle with insecurity before marriage. I used to be confident, grounded, and not overly worried about what others thought. But now I find myself questioning my own thoughts and intuition, and it’s exhausting.\n\nHe keeps asking what he can do to make me trust him again and says he’s done everything he can. But I still feel uneasy. I don’t want to be suspicious or controlling — I just want to feel safe, understood, and like I can trust my own perception again.\n\nHas anyone been through something similar, where the explanation made sense later, but the initial denial left you feeling uneasy? How did you rebuild trust and calm your anxiety when your gut still feels conflicted?\n\nAny kind, honest advice would really help.",

      "selftext": "I know the obvious answer is to leave but I just don’t feel like I can. I (37F) asked my husband (37M) if he was cheating and he denied it. The reason I asked him is that he’s become distant and showing signs of previous behavior of talking inappropriate (sexually related) to another coworker 7 years ago. Back then I went through his phone and found the text. We decided to work through it.\n\nI know I’ve done things that have bothered him lately, just martial things where he doesn’t feel appreciated or I don’t listen to his decisions.\n\nSo lately I’ve felt that maybe he has made another connection at work (he’s at a different company now). He’s been more secretive of his phone and our intimacy (which up until the past month had been amazing) has been almost nonexistent.\n\nWhen I confronted him it went badly. I didn’t want to go through his phone again because I didn’t want to know what I would find, so I just straight up asked him. Clearly that wasn’t a smart move because I don’t think he would ever tell me. In my heart I feel like he is still doing something behind my back.\n\nWhen we got into the argument after I confronted him he basically said he’s unhappy and he doesn’t know what to do. I asked him if he wanted a divorce and he said no. I asked if we can fix this and he said he didn’t know. He said that we will just continue on like we always do.\n\nAs a person I don’t have much self-worth. Im a people pleaser who just wants to take all the blame for my actions that have made him unhappy and find a way to work through this. I want to believe him when he says he’s not cheating.\n\nI don’t want to leave because I don’t want to be separated from my small kids. I’m a stay at home mom and not financially stable.\n\nI understand that this all sounds sad and pathetic. I just don’t know if there is any advice for me. Can men cheat and then go back to their wives? I mean we did it before and there were so many times we were happy afterwards.",

They do seem perfect for each other.  I guess her husband was a coke addict, so maybe my alcoholic ex seemed like an upgrade.  Either way I am not sure the woman went one day without a new man sleeping in her bed from kicking out her husband to my ex basically moving in.  Our kids met her within 5 weeks of him leaving me and by 6 weeks they were spending holidays as a new blended family.  It had severe emotional consequences and on top of it I was extremely sick during this time so they were seeing me throwing up 20x a day for months.  It hurts thinking about how much this is going to impact them the rest of their lives. \n\nNow we discuss custody and my ex talks about his immediate family.  My kids never had time to heal.  After 1.5 years they are still struggling a lot.  When I hear my ex talk this way I feel like saying what is the likelihood 2 people who cheat don't cheat on each other?  He has pushed to move our kid's school district to this woman's house and is fighting me on custody.  For his own biological daughter, she switched schools multiple times depending on who he was screwing.    \n\nI just sometimes feel like I'm waiting for the floor to drop our from my kids again.  Whether it is their fathers household breaking down again or his drinking or something else.  My kids often cry about spending time with him and have nightmares as well.  ",

      "title": "It is hard to move on but here’s my story I tried to be as open as possible",
      "selftext": "It was a week before my birthday in 2019 when my ex walked out of my life.\nThe timing made it worse — not just the heartbreak, but the quiet cruelty of it happening right before a day that was supposed to be mine. I remember standing behind the counter at work, shoulders heavy, trying not to look as hollow as I felt.\n\nThat’s when Kat noticed me.\nShe was a cashier with a warm smile and an instinct for reading faces.\n\nShe asked softly, “Hey, how are you doing?”\n\nI don’t know why I was honest with her. Maybe because I was tired. Maybe because the truth was too close to the surface to bury.\n\n“My ex broke up with me,” I said, “and Friday’s my birthday, so I’m kinda shitty to be honest.”\n\nShe smiled like she saw something worth saving in me. “Don’t worry. You’re cute. You’ll find somebody.”\n\nHer voice was simple, light — but something about it stuck.\n\nOver the next week, we talked in passing. Little things at first. Then, after my birthday, I asked her out. She said yes.\n\nApril 9, 2019.\nOur first date. Applebee’s.\n\nShe told me early on she only wanted to be friends. I laughed it off, split the bill, and stayed anyway. Because something in the way she smiled across that table felt different.\n\nWe talked until the restaurant closed, then sat in my car for hours, trading flirtatious words we pretended not to mean. The air between us was charged but quiet, like a match that hadn’t been struck yet.\n\nWhen I got home, I messaged her to say I made it safely. The conversation picked up where it had left off — a little bolder this time, a little closer to the edge. Flirting turned into late-night confessions, late-night confessions turned into heat.\n\nThe next day, the match finally struck.\n\nBy the end of April, she asked, “Are we… dating?”\nI smiled, asked her to be my girlfriend, and she said yes. Just like that.\n\nEverything moved fast.\nNew jobs. Long nights together. A kind of young love that feels unbreakable while it’s happening.\n\nFor our first Christmas, I found her an old PS3 — the one she used to dream about owning. I cleaned it, replaced the hard drive, wrapped it carefully, and watched her light up like a kid again. She loved it. I loved watching her love it.\n\nWhen the pandemic hit, everything shifted. I lost my job, found another, and we kept building our little life together. And then—\n\nNovember 28, 2020.\nMy father died.\n\nShe came over that night, wrapped her arms around me, and we held each other in a kind of silence that says what words can’t. That night, we made love. And in that quiet, in that grief, our daughter was conceived.\n\nI felt it happen. I just… knew.\n\nWeeks later, before Christmas, she told me she was pregnant. The world could have been falling apart around me and it wouldn’t have mattered. I felt joy. Pure, terrifying, overwhelming joy.\n\nChristmas came. We told her mom. She cried happy tears.\nBut then came the doubts. The whispers of a choice she didn’t want to make but couldn’t ignore. She talked about abortion, and hearing it splintered something inside me.\n\nI told her, “It’s your choice. I’ll be here no matter what you decide. But if you end it… I don’t know if we’d survive it. Not because I’d leave. Because something in me would change.”\n\nShe decided to keep the baby. At first, she wanted adoption. I told her, “Then I’ll raise our kid. You don’t have to be in their life.” She hesitated. She didn’t want to lose me.\n\nIn the end, she chose us. We painted walls. Built cribs. Dreamed of the future.\n\nAnd then our daughter was born.\nTiny. Perfect. A miracle I never thought I’d hold in my arms.\n\nEveryone said I was a good dad. I always said, “It’s all Kat. She’s an amazing mom.”\n\nFor a while, we believed it.\n\nBut our daughter’s words started to fade. “Mama” and “Dada” disappeared into silence. After months of appointments, the doctors said what no parent is ready to hear: autism. They told us she might never speak.\n\nThat night, I opened myself to Kat completely. I told her how scared I was, how much it hurt to think I might never hear “I love you” from my little girl.\n\nBut instead of holding me, she broke down into her own storm, drowning my pain in her guilt.\n\n“I’m a bad mom,” she said. “It’s my fault.”\n\nSo I comforted her. That night, a wall began to grow between us. A quiet wall, made of the things we never said again.\n\nI told myself I had to be strong — for both of them. So I stopped talking about my pain. I kept showing up. But the fights started. Little arguments that became storms.\n\nI told her to stop. She didn’t. So I got louder. She twisted my words into new blades to throw back at me. I shut down. She promised to change, but by then I had already started leaving in my head.\n\nShe talked to other guys behind my back. I didn’t know then. I just felt it.\n\nShe told me about some younger woman at work with big breasts, how jealous she felt. I tried to comfort her, not realizing the real reason for her tears. Later, she cried in my arms over a man who had chosen someone else — not realizing I’d soon find out it was her who wanted him.\n\nThen came April 2025.\nShe had a new friend from work. Another guy.\n\nHe invited us to dinner. She flirted openly. I sat there with a toothache and quiet rage burning under my ribs. April 9th — six years to the day since our first date — and she was laughing with him like I was a shadow at her side.\n\nOn the drive home, she asked why I was so quiet. I didn’t answer. She pushed. I snapped.\n\n“You told him you wanted to blow him,” I said. “You made it disgusting. You disrespected me.”\n\nShe denied it, but that night she disappeared into the dark with her phone. When I found her, she admitted to it — phone sex.\n\nI broke. She begged me to stay. I did. I told myself I could forgive something that “wasn’t physical.”\n\nBut the truth doesn’t stay buried.\n\nI caught her talking to him again. I left. She begged me back. I came home. We tried couples therapy. She smiled like things were fixing themselves.\n\nThen I saw the green bubbles. Another man. Another lie.\n\nI told her, “After everything, I can’t trust you talking to another guy. Not now.”\n\nShe agreed.\nAn hour later, she left me — for him.\n\n⸻\n\nLooking back, I can see it all like a film projected onto a cracked wall.\nThe beginning — warm, bright, golden.\nThe middle — love and the weight of real life pressing down.\nThe end — quiet betrayal dressed as something inevitable.\n\nBut somewhere in all of it, there’s a little girl.\nA light that came from pain, from loss, from love that was real even if it didn’t last.\nShe’s the part of the story that doesn’t break.\n\nShe’s the part I’ll always hold\n\nIt’s strange how love changes shape over time.\n\nFor the first time in years, there’s someone new in my life — and it feels different. Not rushed. Not forced. Just… real. I find myself wanting to take it slow, to actually feel the connection instead of grabbing at it to fill some hollow place inside me. I want to know that when I reach out for her, it’s because I see her — not just a distraction from the past.\n\nWith her, I’m not chasing a high or trying to stitch up old wounds. I’m standing still, breathing, letting something new unfold. And that alone feels like a kind of healing I didn’t know I was capable of.\n\nLast night, a photo popped up on my phone — an old memory of Kat and our daughter. Just an ordinary picture taken years ago, back when we still believed in forever. In the photo, Kat’s looking at me with a love I used to drown in. It used to be the kind of look that made everything else disappear.\n\nBut this time… I saw something different.\n\nI saw her face — the same face I once thought was the most beautiful thing in the world — and I felt nothing. Not the way I used to. Not the soft ache. Not the pull. I saw the love frozen in her eyes, but it didn’t belong to me anymore. It felt like a relic. A fossil from a life that no longer exists.\n\nAnd then something I never expected happened.\nI saw her as… ordinary. Even a little ugly. Not because she’s a monster. Not because she changed. But because I changed. The illusion I held of her — the beauty carved out of my own longing — had finally dissolved.\n\nIt’s a quiet kind of closure, the kind that doesn’t arrive with anger or tears. It just… settles.\n\nFor years, I thought moving on meant forgetting. But maybe it really means seeing them as they are not the dream I once made them into.\n\nAnd maybe, just maybe, it means opening my heart to something new. Something real.",

My wife (32W) and I (33M) have been together for going on 11 years now but were now a month after DDay. \n\nQuestion: I don’t know if i can or want to wait until the next rough period in my year to see whether or not she’s actually committed to staying together. What are the pros and cons of staying and waiting it out. \n\nContext: She was had a two month affair with a coworker and when I found out she trickled truth me for a week trying to hide the worst parts of the affair. She failed because i have screenshots and her told her as much when she pissed me off with the 6 or 7th attempt at trickle truthing me. In the month since we’ve gone to individual therapy and we’re starting to talk about some core issues. Respect on trust on my end, resentment on financials on her end. \n\nShe’s trying to make some effort to rebuild but there’s now this deep suspicion i just can’t let go off. The worst part is that the rough part of my work require me to be rarely around for a month or two every year and the affair followed one of these. When we’re good, we can be great together but its harder when I’m working that much. She also still works with AP, they don’t work super directly but they do have to interact from time to time. \n\nFinancially she makes more but my own job pays well too. \n\n****** Update & Additional Details *******\n\nWoah, i didn’t expect so much feedback! It seems many of you want additional context. For obvoius i won’t go into too much detail but here’s what I can say so far. \n\nShe’s given me access to her phone and emails so far and is no contact with AP.(I’m very familiar with whatsapp, google voice etc. she could try using to skirt around transparency). \n\nShe finally confessed everything after I made the comments about the screenshots (which were confirmed). She’s taken accountability for royally fucking up.\n\nNo she’s hasn’t quit her job, and given the state of things - honest reality is that it would be stupid to jump ship from a six figure job with out a plan. \n\nWe have no kids but on the hook for our mortgage and our cat.

His location showed him at this random hotel and when I tried calling, texting and asking him about it I got no response, for days.

      "selftext": "We’ve known each other since preschool. We went to elementary school together, remained friends, and got together when we were 17. We got engaged at 22, and after that I found out I was pregnant, so we had a quick and small wedding. I thought we were so happy — at least I was.\n\nSoon after our wedding, there was a concert of his favourite band. I didn’t go because I was eight months pregnant and wanted to rest at home. He met her there. A few months after our baby was born, I found out he had been texting her every day since they met. He promised it was nothing, just a friend. Oh, how naïve I was…\n\nFast forward to the end of this September, the last weekend of it — he confessed everything. How he went to a café with her even before I gave birth. How they were meeting almost every weekend this September, even on our anniversary. Even when our baby had an extremely high fever and I had a sprained ankle.\n\nHe said how much he loved her — but she doesn’t want him. He even paid a prostitute long before he met his mistress.\n\nThen he said we could reconcile, but I insisted that he must end their friendship. Well, he did it. We had couples therapy. It seemed okay to me. But then she texted him — and he chose to leave us to find out if she loves him back. He said he still loves her and doesn’t want to be with us.\n\nSo he left me with a 10-month-old baby and two cats, one of them ill.\n\nNow, I don’t want him back. I don’t even want to be friends with him, even though he says he wants that. I want to move on, but I don’t know how. I take care of everything and everyone — even myself (Im in therapy) but I can’t stop thinking about him and her.\n\nI can’t stop wishing she’ll dump him.\nHe even confessed to me that he’d lie about having my nudes — and I hope so much she finds out. I just can’t stop.\n\nIs time my only hope for this to be over?",

It was a single sexual encounter that I know of but multiple occasions of them meeting, as well as daily messages over a 3 week period, but it’s completely broken me. He’s shown a lot of remorse, crying, apologising, saying he doesn’t even understand why he did it because he wasn’t lonely or looking for something else. He says it was an intentional mistake he instantly regretted.\n\nWe had a really deep connection and things were going so well before this happened. I genuinely believed he was someone who’d never hurt me. What’s made it even more painful is that the trigger for this was something small - I had told him I deleted old exes and dates from my Instagram, and he later found one I’d missed. It was a genuine oversight on my part, but for some reason it stirred something in him and he ended up cheating not long after. He’s not blaming me at all, but it’s left me feeling shocked that something so minor could lead to something so destructive.\n\nSince it happened, he’s taken full responsibility, told me I should “get rid of him,” and that he knows I have too much self-respect to go back to him. He says he doesn’t deserve me, and I can tell he’s full of guilt and regret. Despite all of that, I still love him and can’t seem to let go. I miss him so much, and part of me believes he wouldn’t do it again after seeing how much it’s destroyed both of us.\n\nI’m just so lost between my heart and my head.\nHow do you even start to separate them both and move forward and should I be just cutting contact entirely even though I really don’t want that?

      "selftext": "\n< I (27M) discovered my wife (32F) infidelity almost 6 months  ago now, separated for 1 months and a half, divorce procedure started. . We had been together almost 4 years, 2 year married almost all long distance appart from 3 international travel (2x 6 weeks and 1x 5 month across the globe). Her EA and PA was for the 4 last month of our long distance, last meeting the very last day before getting done with the distance. No kid ­­ ­­­>\n\nIn the last 6 months, ive been out of control emotionally, in every sens of the way. I was first sad like never before, sad and hurt. I was feeling abandoned and lonely. All of those emotions slowly turned into anger mixed with intense desired of separation, running away.  I first try to avenge, revenge, replace her, very fast I did not want any fling or dates anymore, nothing of that, and im back to feel sad, lonely and missing her. But the ANGER is still so much strong. Everytime I see her I plan and want to manage my emotions fairly, to stay calm and contented, to show empathy trough it all. But I fail every and single time, I get angry so fast, at the first sing of conflictual attitude or perceived blame. But it is me who ask for the separation, but i also execept warmness and empathy, but I’m not even giving it myself. I get angry, I yell, hit on stuff, insult, threated to cause for trouble. I’m alway deeply and completely ashamed but I repeat the pattern evey occasion I get.  When I’m alone and with no contact for a week or two, I feel more in control and empathic, lately even regretful mostly of not having dealt with the infidelity in a more mature or flexible way.  Being long distance for the majority of the relationship,  with someone like me with a very anxious attachment, topped by anger issues and frequent insecurities,  had to add a big toll with time. In addition of that, she had to get used to a new country, and i was very impatient on healing up, putting the whole responsability on her, without actually giving us the time needed for that.  Now, the last couple of contacts we had can be summarized to cold and distance attitude of her and angry outburst of my part.  She now thinking of filling a complain against me for it, I cant say I blame her… \n\n",

      "selftext": "I don’t even know where to start.\n\nWe have been together for almost 9 years. Married one. We’re both 27. \n\nI recently discovered that my wife (husband, idk honestly.) has been unfaithful. not once, but over and over, across years. I found everything out myself — dating app accounts, messages, deleted histories. She didn’t confess; I searched her reddit name and found her looking to screw people on our cruise we went on in September. \n\nIt turns out she’d been on dating apps for about six years, and the first physical cheating started around four years ago. There were five men total that I know of. The last time was last year. And then, right after our wedding — literally within days — she installed a dating app again.\n\nWhen I confronted her, she didn’t come clean all at once. She trickled out information slowly, only admitting details after I already had proof. Every conversation felt like pulling teeth — like she was managing how guilty she looked instead of being honest.\n\nThe reasons she gave were confusing and painful. She said she wasn’t looking for “validation” or love from men — it was about craving penetration. She said she knows she’s a woman but felt like it would be “demasculating” to ask me to give her that with toys. Instead of talking to me about that need or insecurity, she secretly went to men for it.\n\nTo make things even more confusing, she’s also said that she doesn’t really “believe she’s trans” — that she just wants to live like a man, or at least doesn’t fit into any clear label. It’s like she’s deeply conflicted about who she is, but I’m the one left holding all the pain and confusion from her choices. She was literally given the a okay to transition after a 10 minute consult when we were 19. \n\nShe grew up watching her mother cheat, and she always said she’d never be like that. She talked about how betrayal disgusted her — and yet, she turned around and did the same thing to me, for years, while looking me in the eyes and promising loyalty.\n\nWhat’s destroyed me most isn’t just the sex — it’s the lies. The way she kept me in the dark, let me believe we were solid, while she was living this secret life. It makes me question every part of our relationship, the intimacy, the vows, the “I love yous.”\n\nI feel gutted. Angry, numb, lost. I don’t even know what’s true anymore, or who I was married to.\n\nWe are both going to therapy, separately. When the time is right, couples therapy. I think she has truly hard gender identity issues along with shame about her sexual preferences. Is this going to get better? \n\n",

I’m regaining a little of my old self and that’s been amazing. \n\nSome not so good- my house hasn’t sold yet. Listed in March and nothing so it’s been truly making me feel still stuck in that old energy. Paying the mortgage and arguing with my ex about paying his half has been draining. Whether he pays half or a small percentage, based on what he thinks is fair, is a battle in and of itself. Per our realtor, we had to take it off the market this month to reset. I will probably have to engage my lawyer once we relist to start getting ready to fight at closing for what he owes per our agreement. I don’t bother engaging with him. \n\nAnyways, some other issues popped up that I hope to get some advice on. With the chaos of my life the last few years, I put off potentially having surgery for an injury. Recovery will be hard, but the worst part is losing more time. I just got my life and hope back and feel like I have to lose more time to pursue dreams that were put on the back burner because of my ex. It feels unfair he’s off living his life doing whatever with his affair partner, money, time etc. and here I am not able to again. Has anyone dealt with something similar or have advice? The unfairness is the part I’m struggling with a lot. \n\nThank you for being a great community! ",

They are also physically close, more than friends would be. They're spending practically all their free time together while T's partner is away.\n\nWhen I speak with H, he has so much empathy for T and none for her partner. This triggered me like never before: I was cheated on in a long-term relationship years ago (although that was fully physical and emotional). H was the only person I had confided in back then, and he had seen how broken it had left me.\n\nI'm realizing I just swept it under the rug at that time and blamed myself. So in a way I'm glad these repressed feelings came up again; it's helped me clarify a lot about my past relationship that I never processed earlier.\n\nThis also has me reconsidering my friendship with H. He admits it's wrong but is unwilling to set boundaries with T and wants to continue being \"friends\" with her, which has me doubting his values. I know the onus is more on the cheating partner, but...",

      "selftext": "Update to my original at [https://www.reddit.com/r/survivinginfidelity/comments/1nu1dl7/comment/niv5gsm/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/survivinginfidelity/comments/1nu1dl7/comment/niv5gsm/?context=3) \n\nThings have still been rough. I have come to the realization she doesn't respect my feelings. I'm not sure she can. She is mad at me for not being over it. She says she see's my position, but again rather than try and act like it I get fussed at for how I'm making her feel. How I make her feel insecure, how I make her feel guilt and shame because of the look in my eye. I let out all the pain after she started in on me that she is bending over backwards for me, how she wants me but I ignore her, how I don't communicate and that is what got us into this mess. So I let it out. After sitting there and listening to me bawl my eyes out she then lays into me about how I drug up the past and all her past trauma (which I will admit she has plenty from before we met). She tells me she's having suicidal thoughts that are getting really serious, then gets mad when I start talking about getting her help. I realized she doesn't/can't even respect my feelings, whether she agrees with them or not. She thinks I'm overreacting. I don't know if she's in a mental state to actually see things from any perspective but her own.\n\nI try to come home and focus on the positives for my own sanity and the kid's sake (my oldest asked me what was wrong with her mom, I explained some of it, and even my daughter said I was stupid for not realizing her mom knows how to manipulate my feelings). I really do still love her (although a friend asked if I was still \"in love\" and it was not easy to answer). I nearly have panic attacks going home after work wondering if I'm walking into another episode of \"all I'm doing to her\". When I try to be positive it isn't enough. I try to hug her, hold her, kiss her. I'm not acting like I used to (a horny teenager who couldn't keep his hands off of her), and now she is feeling unwanted and all the sudden wants me like crazy. I can't help but think she isn't getting what she is used to because of what I'm dealing with and she can't stand it. Then she wants to drink or get her doctor to up a med so she doesn't have to deal with her feelings. She's running away like she did with her medical problems.\n\nThursday night I stood up for myself when she got mad at how I've been (at our son's soccer game of all places). Her frustration brings out truth (like \"why can't you get over it? why did you have to drag up the past, you're a shadow of my husband, I want things to go back to the way they were\"). I defended myself. I admitted when asked that I have thought about a cooling off period at my parents since we fight so much, to which I got \"I knew it, I knew it\". I stood up to her. I called out some of her behaviors. The next day she was much nicer than she has been, texting me throughout the day more than just the usual. It continued into Saturday, although she got all huffy that I ran into a lady we've both known and who I have worked with in the past. She caught me up on her new role and apparently my wife took that as flirting (doesn't matter I didn't and would have no interest in this woman). Last night she wanted to be intimate and engaged instead of sulking like she has been. I asked her today what has changed, and all she said was \"I don't feel as heavy\". I don't know how I feel about it. On one hand I'm happy because it seems \"normal\". On the other hand I can't help but feel she's manipulating me.\n\nShe is finally in therapy. I'm not sure what good it will do because I think it is reinforcing her own beliefs without thinking about my feelings. I wanted her to get mentally stable enough (suicidal thoughts under control) before marriage counseling, but she asked if I'd do it and I said I would. I think this will be a determining factor on what happens next. If she will actually listen and hear me and at least respect my feelings (again, doesn't necessarily agree with, but at least acknowledge them) then maybe we have something to work on. If not.....I can't stay in a relationship where I'm not respected.\n\nIn the meantime I'm going to keep standing up for myself. It isn't easy. I'm used to caving to her feelings. I still have, even Thursday to an extent, but I have started standing up for myself. I appreciate the support I've gotten here. It has helped me realize a lot of what I've really been dealing with. I don't have much fight left in me, but I guess I'm not ready to give up just yet (even though part of me thinks I'm a fool).",

      "title": "My GF cheated on me with her ex",
      "selftext": "I honestly don’t even know where to start. I’m completely lost.\n\nI met my girlfriend two years ago. We’re both lesbians.\nWhen we met, she had just broken up with her partner of nine years, because her ex is polyamorous and my girlfriend isn’t. They kept a close and friendly relationship, since they own a business together. She always said her ex was her “best friend”, and they sometimes went on “work trips” or met up for coffee.\n\nAt the time, it didn’t bother me. About a year ago, I found out they had shared a bed on one of those trips. It really hurt me — I felt it was crossing a line. She apologized deeply and swore that nothing sexual happened, that it was just her best friend and the hotel room had already been booked.\n\nHer ex even told me the same thing , that there was nothing romantic between them, just a very strong bond, almost like a mother-daughter relationship. My girlfriend has always been sweet and loving, and her family and friends have always treated me with kindness and respect.\n\nThen last Thursday, she had a bike accident broke her arm and lost a few teeth. I immediately rushed to take care of her and spent every day by her side.\n\nToday, her ex asked me to help set up her new iPhone. My girlfriend also asked me to check if everything had synced to the cloud because she’s terrible with tech. That’s when I discovered the photos and messages… and eventually looked through their WhatsApp conversation.\n\nHere’s what I found:\n- I love you,” “kisses,” “my love” every morning\n-Her ex sending photos like “here’s the picture from 7 years ago when I proposed to you”\n-Messages about when they’d be sleeping together\n-Recent photos of the two of them in bed together on “work trips” and kissing in front of a mirror at work\n-Her ex saying “I’m glad you have two girlfriends who love you”\n-Her ex mocking the fact that my girlfriend had made a group chat with the three of us on Instagram: “Good thing I didn’t call you ‘my love’ lol”\n-My girlfriend replying “I want to share my life with you.”\n\nWhen I saw all this, I woke her up screaming, O was heartbroken. She barely opened her eyes and said, “I’m sorry, she’s my best friend,” and then added that “they never kissed with tongue.” (I almost fainted when she said that.)\n\nI left immediately and I’m now staying at a friend’s place. I feel completely betrayed and lost. I love her, she’s always been kind and caring and her family and friends have been nothing but good to me. But I don’t know how to handle this, or if I can ever trust her again.\n\nHas anyone been through something similar? How did you deal with it? Should I even consider staying in this relationship, or is it over?\n",

      "title": "A letter to the other woman",
      "selftext": "A letter to the other woman\n\nIt’s taking the entirety of my self control to not send this her. Advice from the internet says not to. My husband is begging me not to. But I can’t help but feel like it would alleviate a fraction of the weight that’s been sitting on my chest for weeks since D day. I know hurt begets more hurt yadda yadda but it’s literally been occupying the majority of my thoughts every day. I know this would hurt her, and in turn hurt my husband. I don’t want to be the bigger person anymore.\n\n\n>I’ve written and erased and rewritten this so many times. Cycling through the continuous waves of grief, rage, embarrassment, anxiety, and shame. But I think now I mostly pity you.\n\n\n>I’m not sure what exactly you had to tell yourself every day for the past year (and probably longer) to justify your decisions. I understand it takes two people to commit this heinous act, but I often wonder what specifically went through your mind when you were monopolizing my husband. You sabotaged not only your own marriage and family, but also mine. You blew up my entire life without any regard for the fallout. Did you ever consider the weight of all the lies he not only told me, his wife, but also to his own family? Did you think they would accept you? Not likely. We have a real history and a relationship that you will never be privileged to. What about your own family? Clearly you prioritized your own desires before your children’s best interests. Did you even consider how this would affect their own outlooks on life, love, and the meaning of family? \n\n\n>Your selfishness poisoned so many others around you and fractured relationships with those around him. Did you really think a “love” born out of lies and sneaking around would withstand? Our lives are intricately and complexly woven together in a way that you will never be. You do not have twelve years of love, joy, mistakes, forgiveness, and milestones with him. You weren’t there for birthdays, funerals, holidays, and the quiet moments of everyday life. I constitute over a third of his life, you are nothing but a fragment. You were an escape when things got tough, hidden like a shameful secret, not chosen to be a part of his real life. You were both in a fantasy world, complete with delusions and irrational dreams and messy plans.\n\n\n>The version of him you think you know? A man free to curate and build a relationship with you? No. It was a mirage that only existed because you both pushed aside the truth and ignored all aspects of reality. I wonder what lies he told you about me - maybe that I was unloving? Didn’t pay attention? Didn’t really listen? Picked fights? Had a dead bedroom? Here’s the truth. I have never stopped loving him. Fights were started just because it was the most reliable way to get even just a little bit of attention. The bedroom was far from dead. No marriage is perfect and ours had many flaws. But for so long I’ve done nothing but think of him, every single day, begging for him to open up to me. Pleading to go to therapy. Apologizing again and again for the belittling and how horrible I made him feel during arguments. It still stands as my biggest regret with him. I tried so hard to be the woman who he needed, the one who gave more touches and physicality.  So often I asked myself what had I done wrong? Because I could feel the love he had for me slipping away. I was so confused, sad, and anxious all the time. I still am. I wondered why I wasn’t worthy of coffee dates, lunches during the work day, or little gifts here and there. Can you imagine how it felt to have your wedding anniversary go unacknowledged by your own spouse? I cried myself to sleep so many nights when he left me at home alone to live out his social work life with the team, always uninvited. \n\n\n>Now I know why. The dedication, love, and attention he should have been directing to our marriage? He wasted it on you. Did you ever wonder why things seemed so effortless and easy between you two? Because he gave you the cheat code - he told you exactly what I was doing wrong and what he was missing. All you had to do was fill in the blanks. I’ve made more than my fair share of mistakes but know this: I never gave up on our marriage. I never stopped loving him. I always believed that we were going to live a beautiful and fulfilling life together.\n\n\n>Let me be very clear: he was never yours. No matter what he whispered into your ear in hotel rooms and parking lots. Those stolen moments, affections, and time were never yours. The deeply personal details of our marriage were never yours. The jealousy you had when he was open about our own physical relationship was never yours to feel. He confided in you my own private thoughts and trauma that was never meant for you. You played a crucial role in the desecration of our vows. Vows you both clearly have no respect for. Did you really think love could be built on betrayal?\n\n\n>Instead of honoring the innate bond of women, you chose to stab another in the back. You do not protect or uplift other women - you foster mistrust and animosity among us. You are a woman of the worst and most disgusting kind: one who sees another woman’s life, marriage, and family and decides it’s hers for the taking. I welcomed you into my home. You welcomed me in yours. We shared meals and small talk. It’s not like I was a faceless nobody who you had never met (not that it would have made the situation any less disgusting). Yet you still chose cruelty over compassion. You both knew exactly how your selfish actions would hurt others and you proceeded deliberately without caution or care. What kind of person does that? It was hateful and wrong and now you have to live with this stain on your soul for the rest of your life.\n\n\n>It takes two broken people to commit a betrayal of this magnitude. Two people willing to go to great lengths to lie, sneak, steal, and destroy. Reckless infatuation in pursuit of chasing a temporary high to escape your own shattered selves. I can’t even begin to imagine the mental gymnastics you both conjured to convince yourselves that your actions weren’t as vile as they really are. The disconnect from truth and accountability. There were so many choices deliberately made, choices that caused irreparable harm. You have no idea of the pain of a betrayal so deep that it robs you of your breath, sleep, and peace. You both did that.\n\n\n>This letter isn’t for you. It's for me. It’s to say I see you for who you are. Homewrecker. I want you to know I feel the deep and permanent wounds you helped to inflict every single day. Wounds that will haunt me everyday for the rest of my life.",

      "selftext": "Hello everyone! Sorry if this is the incorrect flair, i really don't know what else to put this as,\n\nI haven't seen a single person on here talk about the experience of being cheated on/betrayed while living with DID, so i'm making it for anyone in the future in a similar situation and wants to feel seen.\n\n**General info before i start:-**\n\n* you will see me write i/me as us/we very frequently, i apologize ahead of time for any confusion this might cause.\n* System: The collective of alters within a body (commonly used as a noun)\n* Alter: \"An alter is a dissociated self state\" , \"Alters each have their own perception of self as a unique individual or entity and do not view themselves as only an aspect of a complete person.” (Taken directly from did-research.org)\n\n\n\nOur ex and us were in a committed relationship for about \\~6 happy years, we both were planning to get married soon,\n\nuntil they decided we were \"not going to work out long-term” and that ”our life-long goals don't align”, despite the fact this conversation was not brought up before they wanted to get with their new AP, that they had sex with once, then felt \"guilty like they were cheating\" when they started an EA all during our relationship, how convenient! Thank god we didn't go for that marriage huh?\n\nI won't talk about it too much though, thats a different kind of post, but tldr; They neglected, lied, blamed, and hid things from us, broke up with us, neglected us more, until we completely decided to go NC\n\nthis all happened about a month ago (not a very long time, as everyone on this sub might understand).\n\nso, how is life like so far, about a month after the breakup? Well, long story short: as bad as you expect it to be, but oddly ok?\n\nlong story long:\n\n**Dissociation:-**\n\nIt's been horrid LOL, at the beginning of it all we had no sense of self, no grounding, just a big clusterfuck mess of an identity trying to survive, we have had life threatening experiences before, many times, many traumatic moments as well, yet it truly felt like this was the biggest tragedy to occur to us somehow, a major betrayal of trust is never easy.\n\nThankfully, we have been here before (dissociation, not cheated on, that sure is a first!) , so we've been getting back into the whole identity \"who even am i” solutions, now we just lose who we are commonly instead of constantly and always LOL! Unfortunately, our dissociation to our surroundings has taken a big hit, we can't seem to ground ourselves. Here's hoping we can deal with that sooner rather than later.\n\n**Living with all this:-**\n\nAlso bad :D! Because of the major dissociation, we would forget to take care of ourself very often, until some other alter manages to wrangle the ability to briefly take care of us.\n\nliving with this disorder on its own is hard, and very scary (this is just a thing of me complaining about it, feel free to skip vvv)\n\n>!The amnesia is scary, not knowing what someone else is doing with your life is scary (but, i trust them to not fuck it up haha), not recognizing who you even are is scary, never having full privacy is scary, never being fully grounded is scary. My life is not my own, it probably will never be, and that is scary.!<\n\nBut i don’t know how i’d be here right now if it wasn't for this, this disorder was my brain's attempt at survival when we were little, and there's not much else to say except it worked, i’m here now aren’t i?\n\nthere’s a trade-offer to my survival, almost everyday i give away major things for it (personhood, identity, memories.) but it at least helped/helps me survive some horrific shit, for instance, all of this mess.\n\nBut we have been functional, it sounds odd to be so proud of us but we've been, hell, maybe even more functional than when we were with our ex?\n\n**Alters:-**\n\n\"They have different thoughts, perceptions, and memories relating to themselves and to the world around them.\"\n\n\"Often, alters have their own wants, needs, desires, and opinions. They may have psychological disorders and physiological reactions that are unique to them..\"\n\n(did-research.org again)\n\nSome of our alters are sympathetic towards our ex, some are worried for the AP and their partner, some want the worst to happen to all of them, some can't seem to stop blaming ourself for it, some wants everything with that to stop mattering so we move on, and some have been seemingly perfectly a-okay (whether they really are or are pretending, idk),\n\nFrom what i read, these are all normal emotions of a person who was cheated on, but its like its been cut up and shared between us.\n\nI'm so saddened for everyone who has to experience all these things on their own, and i cannot begin to imagine that.\n\nIf you're a non-system reading this, you're strong, amazingly strong, If you have/had to do that singularly, all on your own, some people just don't deserve you, and i'm proud of you.\n\nIf you're another system reading this, you got this, cheaters, no matter who they are, are never worth it. If all this doesn't sound similar to what you're experiencing, it'll be ok, system experience can vastly differ, all of what i am saying is my own. If you need or want support from someone who might understand even a little bit of this, shoot us a message.",

      "selftext": "Hi all,  \nI’m in my late 30s, going through a divorce after a 16-year relationship. My wife cheated and left me about 3 months ago. It’s been brutal. I’m trying to stay afloat, but I’m really struggling with loneliness and figuring out how to rebuild my life. I'm realizing that I relied on her for a lot of my social fulfillment.\n\nI now live alone in the suburbs between DC and Baltimore. I have some chronic pain/physical limitations (back, feet, arms) which limits what I can do physically and honestly, I think that contributed to the marriage breaking down.\n\nHere’s what I’m doing now:\n\n* Light exercise 3–4x/week (short walks, gentle workouts)\n* Weekly divorce support group\n* Weekly therapy\n* 1–2 friend phone calls per week\n* Board game meetup every other week\n* See local friends every other week (I have about 6 local friends)\n\nThat adds up to about 3, limited social things per week, but I still feel really isolated. I have a dog, and a job that’s super easy and I work from home. I'm not really interested in pushing my career any further. I’ve got a lot of free time.\n\nMy hobbies are mostly solo: reading, meditation, crosswords. I’m open to hiking or nature walks once I rehab my foot. But I *really* want to avoid falling into a routine of just watching YouTube or TV every night and slowly wasting away. I definitely need to figure out new hobbies and make more friends but I don't even know where to start.\n\nIt feels especially hard being a guy in this stage of life. I don’t like sports, and most of my friends have families and young kids, so it’s hard to find time or shared interests.\n\n**What do other single guys do to feel engaged, social, or purposeful?** Especially if you don’t have a super athletic lifestyle or a big local friend group?\n\nWould love to hear any advice, ideas, or even just encouragement.",

      "selftext": "Had an interesting night out with myself and a few friends who have recently been either in the throes of separation or dealing with reconciliation.\n\nSomeone bought up how \"routine\" domestic violence is much less tolerated now in relationships than it was decades ago. And why is that? There are consequences: people leave and are encouraged to do so, people get arrested, etc.  But in one area there's actually been a struggle with handling domestic violence and that's with the people in relationships with law enforcement officers.  Why? Well, cops will protect cops and they know they are much less likely to face any real consequences.\n\nThen my friend bought up a good point:  she tried reconciling 4 times. Finally, her WH said, well, I know you won't leave me no matter what. She stayed again, another \\*\\*2\\*\\* times before finally giving him a real consequence.\n\nI've been cheated on in 2 relationships. Like everyone else I said, cheating in a dealbreaker and I swore up and down I'll leave if you cheat on me- I PROMISE. Then, in my first relationship I was cheated on, I decided to stay because I loved them and oh why not give them another chance or two sighhh. Wasted years and years. The second relationship, I actually meant it and walked. I'm not saying that was easy, but damn did it surprise him and caught him off-guard. \n\nI've been in 2 more relationships since. One was casual and we really were just better friends (he was also figuring out his sexuality, we're still close though) and my current one is great. But if he cheated? Boy bye. I have confidence now not in the sense of \"I'm hot and look at me\", the confidence is I \\*mean\\* what I say and I act on it. \n\n In my recent relationships I asked about cheating and both men told me similar things, \"everyone faces choices and temptations, but if you know there's a real consequence, you won't do it. You just won't, but you know those people who will stay and not give you a real consequence and it's not always conscious, you just know. Going to therapy isn't a consequence. You being mad at me or sad isn't a consequence- you have to remember that if you decide to cheat you are probably lacking a level of empathy where THIS ISN'T A CONSEQUENCE. Ending it with the affair partner isn't a consequence. Me losing the relationship is an ACTUAL consequence I would have to face.\" \n\nReconciliation and our devotion to this idea that we have to fix romantic relationships and marriages is a perceived noble cause, but just in reality? It just avoids serving consequences to the person who actually committed the offense. Culturally, the norm right now is \"save the marriage! reconcile! go to therapy! you MUST TRY TO SAVE IT!\"   \n\nThis to me only \\*further exacerbates\\* the problem because NOW if the relationship fails it's now \\*\\*both\\*\\* partners fault since they \\*\\*both\\*\\* participate in reconciliation. I WISH I would've realized that sooner because I shouldered the blame for that relationship failing. The second relationship when I left, I held ZERO blame in the relationship ending because the \\*consequence was on the cheater\\* and not on me not doing enough in reconciliation. \n\nIf it was the cultural norm to walk away from the cheater at the \\*very first time we found out they cheated\\* then I believe there would be less infidelity overall. Unfortunately, the culture now is to drag out fixing broken crushed pieces of glass. It gives me some hope seeing threads in places like this where people are supportive in calling out that you aren't a failure if a relationship ends. ",

      "selftext": "\nEssentially just here for a rant and some advice if possible. Ive had a bit of a feeling for a while which led me to have a scroll through his phone when asleep. Whilst I've been away for a few days, I've found my boyfriend has been texting and inviting various different women to the flat we live in together for sex on a secret Snapchat account. I'm done with the relationship and given what I've found I don't think I could ever respect him again. It's not only upset and hurt me, it's also embarrassing to see the desperation. My boyfriend doesn't know I know and I'm unsure how the best way to confront him. Outside of the relationship, I have a fucked up and insanely busy life and work is essentially none stop until January. Do I keep it to myself till then? Can I leave him without actually even telling him I know about the cheating? I feel it'll be hard to live with him for the next few months but I don't see the point in uprooting my entire life at the worst possible time for me for his mistakes.  There is no possible way forward and I don't want to continue in a  relationship, (especially one where marriage and kids is on the near horizon), where someone seeks out casual sex because their partner is away for 4 days.

      "selftext": "\n\nSo I 23M started dating my girlfriend 22F 2 years ago and I instantly fell in love with her and I gave her my everything thinking she was the one and she seemed to reciprocate the same although she had not given me any commitment up until a month or so. ( she gave me commitment only when I went on a trip and was away for 10 days ). \n\nWe did not have sex up until 3 months into the relationship, we did other stuff but not the main thing, but she didn’t used to give me time to think. She used to meet me every-other day , used to video call me a million times in a day and I also fell harder. I also made her meet my mom after 5 months but later I started discovering the red flags like her past relationships, her having been connected with people from the past still and her seeking too much attention from other guys and being flirty with them. \n\nOnce I checked her phone 6 months into the relationship and she fought with me a lot on that and i never did it again up until now. So she has this doctor friend since 3-4 years and she had almost confessed about all her past relationships 1 year into the relationship. So this doctor guy js one of her casuals and she is still connected with him because she asks for medical advice from him time to time ( tbh i have had a problem with him since the beginning and she knows it ) now what I found out just now after 2 years while I was just randomly scrolling her insta is that she kinda emotionally cheated on me after we were together for 6 months ( she was talking with this guy and this guy had sent her some post about her sexual interests and had said that I got good sex and I hope I get a good lawyer in future ( my gf is pursuing law ) she replied hahah hopefully a judge ( because she was also prepping for judiciary, then he goes on to ask her to meet him for a couple of beers and she says somedayyy ( she says she just replied this somedayyy to shoo him away ). Now i’m dealing with a lot of mixed emotions I have very calmly told her that I got all sweaty while reading that conversation and I need time to process it , maybe even 1 week or maybe even 3 then I will decide I can stay or not and she kept on telling me how she didn’t love me at the start but loves me a lot now and can’t live without me , that she had a lot of trauma from her ex because he cheated on her and she thought all boys are like that only so she kept her guard up and kept the options open ( but i don’t understand then why to commit and deceit me ), after i did not give into her cries she has been constantly apologising and asking for one last chance because she sees a future with me and she wants to change for good ( she has changed a lot honestly since I started pinpointing things I didn’t like she did work on them ). \n\nAt one point I think to forgive her that’s it’s nothing and after sometime i think i should trust my gut which I ignored earlier and leave her for my own good. Because I have caught this small thing I dont know what else she did. Although she swears nothing was physical she was just frank and flirtatious with other guys for the first 6 months. she even says she didn’t even remember this chat and she never deletes chats which I suspect is another lie , like she kept on telling me since 2 years she would never cheat me cause she is the most loyal person on earth ⛳️ and I always told her baby please never decieve me and always please tell me first before doing anything and then we can decide ( i even told her i don’t care about her getting physical with anyone just be honest with me ) \n\nThat fact that is hurting me the most isn’t that she emotionally cheated me or something, it is how she pretended to love me while she says she wasn’t even in love and it later developed because she saw how good i was to her, how she hid things like this and I don’t know how many other skeletons she has , I can’t trust her after this because she has this amazing ability fool me. Please tell me am I over-reacting ? Can this relationship still work ? ",

      "selftext": "Long story short, I'm an intern (doc in training). I met my wife at the tail end of undergrad and we dated for 7 wonderful years - she saw me through grad school, medical school, and all that came with it and vice versa on her own journey. We got married in my last year of medical school and right away things deteriorated, culminating in her having a one night stand while on vacation right as I started residency. Come to find out she had been running a Onlyfans-esque social media account chatting/sexting with whoever would interact the entire time I was applying for residency. She at least gradually told me and I broke things off out of respect for myself and we are separated. I fully expect that I'll never get closure for how or why and I know I deserve better.\n\nThat was 3 months ago. I work at least 80 hours a week and work is hard and fulfilling, which has been a great source of validation. But I came home from work this morning and I'm just a wreck. I slept through a date with someone new (yeah I'm trying, idk) and am flying out of town for work tomorrow and I just feel trapped. I chose my residency based on our mutual careers and now I feel like I have nothing tying me here. My family is on the other side of the country and so are my friends and it's tough knowing I'll be apart from them for years and years (I'm in a longer training program). My coworkers I am still getting to know and many of them have families or SOs. Part of me wants to uproot my life and leave but the way residency training works, I'd be burning bridges and there may not even be a training position in my field close to home. It's hard to get out and try new things with my schedule. I just hit my 30s too. This all seems like a lot of excuses... I know I have the power to change things and that life will get better but the grief is just hitting tonight. I just miss having a person to share my life with and half want to text her tonight. It's hard to burden my friends with all this constantly, so I'm trying here.\n\nThanks...",

      "selftext": "The context:\n\nI (M35) found out a few days ago that my wife (F27) of 4 years (we've been together for 7) and mother of our 5 year old son had slept with someone in September and had been sexting him since.  When called out she also admitted to making out with and flirting with people at bars when she was out with friends, including the bartenders.  She said that she's felt for a year that she wasn't happy in the relationship, that she felt alive when doing these things, that she felt seen, that I wasn't showing that I wanted to be in a relationship with her and didn't see her for who she was.  The relationship has been mostly sexless between us for the past year and I've done everything I could to make things good for our house (taking care of the chores, staying home with our son so she could act and spend time with friends, etc).  I tried to make it easy to love me/want me.  She thought that we both weren't really in the relationship and that I wouldn't even care.  Obviously, when we were talking about it she realized she had it totally wrong and I'm a fucking mess.\n\nAt times I want to scream in her face, to smash everything in our house, to tell her to leave and file for divorce.  Then I lose myself in uncontrollable sobbing.  I have a pressure in the middle of my chest like someone is pressing a finger against my sternum or a string pulling me in on myself like a dying star.  I feel like a fool for not seeing her the way she needed or the signs that something was wrong.  I feel disgusted at her behaviour.  I feel like I can't go out for fear of people knowing.  I feel inadequate.  But I also love her more than anything in the world (barring our child) and I don't want her to leave.\n\nThe only person who can comfort me the way I need is the best friend who has hurt me in the worst way imaginable.\n\nWe have been talking about the whole thing for 3 days, we've both cried A LOT.  She is going to live with her parents for the week.  We are going to live separately for a time and go to a couples therapist because I want to put in the work to either come back from this or learn that we really do need to divorce.  She said she wants us both to see what else is out there for us and maybe we'll find our way back to each other. \n\nThe question:\n\n What is the right choice here?  Do I try to see other people while we're separated?  Do I let her leave without a fight?  Is it worth going to couples therapy at this point?",

While my sister was trying to send herself some photos from his phone, she opened Whatsapp and saw that the most recent chat he had was with a woman who had a compromising profile picture, and the messages between them suggested that she offers a certain “type” of service and that they were supposed to meet that same day.\n\nLater that day, I (20) checked his phone myself to see what else I could find, but I noticed that he had deleted the entire conversation and that he had saved her number since August.\n\nRight now, only my sister and I know about this, and we don’t know whether or how to tell our mother. We’re both shocked,we would have never expected this from him, he’s a very educated,decent, polite and amable man who provides for us and shows us every day that he loves us. His relationship with my mother seems unchanged, they get along just as well as always. The only slightly unusual thing is that they sleep in separate rooms, but it’s been like that since my sister and I were little.\n\nI don’t know what to do. We’re a close, united family and have a good relationship with each other. My sister wants to tell our mother, but I don’t. I just hope this is a crazy episode that will pass, because I’m afraid that revealing this will tear our family apart and ruin our relationships. My mother would be absolutely devastated, she could never accept something like this. I’m so confused ,I just want some advice on what I should do…",

      "selftext": "I am two days into finding out my fiance/long time partner of 10 years has been reaching out every so often on reddit (ironically) to women to exchange pictures and sext for at least the last 4 years and has been actively in a porn addiction. Obviously I have a lot of context to this so I'll try to give the important details. \n\nFor context: -I did find out he had a porn addiction early into our relationship, but figured us being physical fixed it due to having a \"religious naivety POV\" at the time. \n\n\\- we have rarely had sex since I had our child who will be 3 soon. but had a decent sex life before.\n\n\\-I struggled extremely with postpartum depression and anxiety and sought treatment when the baby was almost 2. \n\n\\-I have been a stay at home mom since having the baby with no vehicle due to it breaking down, and recently started college and a part time job while continuing my \"homely duties\" (cooking, cleaning, childrearing, meal prepping, dr appointments, etc)\n\n\\-we have had many conversations about him when it comes to lack of consideration for me, lack of empathy, and overall lack of emotions and emotional connection. Especially wanting that connection so it could help our sex life.\n\n\\-two years into our relationship, he broke up with me. But continued wanting to have sex and talk while setting boundaries with me about not getting back into a relationship together or saying I love you. during the period of \"situationship\" I got with someone he was really close to. eventually came clean when we talked about getting back together and broke his heart. And when he was ready I worked my ass off to prove my love and regret since he did consider it cheating. and I hated that I hurt him.\n\nTwo days ago he came home from work explaining to me that he was looking for \"porn\" on reddit, found a post of a nude, messaged the person then exchanged pictures, with the person asking to see a pic of his face too. Stupidly he did, then of course was told to send money or all pictures would be sent to family and friends. He did not send any money , and said if it is sent to others then it's what he deserves. Honestly I just felt pretty numb and slightly suspicious this was out of the blue, asked if he deleted the reddit account, he said he did. And we went on about our day. When he went back to work I had a horrible inkling to snoop, I usually never give in since I had never had a reason to before. But turns out the account was not deleted, it was mostly wiped but I saw enough to see a comment asking for a private message for a deleted post asking \" for a dm if anyone was down\" and upvoted a woman's nude picture. \n\nWhen he got home from work I confronted him about it. And he came clean about everything which is when I found out about it being a porn addiction that turned into messaging strangers. He could not give an estimate of the amount of times this could have happened and said it happens in spurts. First he justified it with the fact that we do not have sex enough. Then realized he was not faithful to me and it is not justified to message other women. He seems extremely remorseful, set up a therapy appointment to get help, deleted every social media account that \"tempted\" him while I watched,  has been extremely loving, vulnerable, emotional, and more helpful with the home and our child. \n\nWhere I am struggling is I constantly cycle between numbness, anger, sadness, neediness, then to feeling loved by him. I don't know what is happening but I do feel so much more physical attraction to him now, like I used to. And we have already had sex twice since he came clean. I don't know if it's because he is finally showing emotion and vulnerability even though it has hurt me? I thought I would have been angry, distant, and vindictive honestly. But I'm not and I don't know if that's right? Am I processing this okay?",

      "selftext": "My wife cheated on me 5 and a half years ago, only a month after I moved in with her. I found out quickly. She had gone to visit a “friend” and took with her a bag that had sex toys in it. She came home around 2 a.m., acting completely normal. I pretended to be asleep, but my heart was racing, I was nauseous, and I could feel my body burning with dread.\n\nIn the morning, I confronted her. She admitted she was in love with the woman, so I left and stayed with a friend for a week. She begged me to come back, and, stupidly, I did. I really loved her. She never apologized, and she kept in contact with the woman, even seeing her multiple times afterward. They only stopped talking last year when the woman ghosted my wife. I never wanted them to stay friends, but my wife told me that if I asked her to cut contact, I’d be controlling.\n\nFast forward to January of this year: things seemed good. We were engaged and happy. I still had never received an apology for the cheating, but I’d buried it deep down. Then I found out she had been using hard drugs for nine months and lying to my face about it. That discovery shattered me. It made me realize how many lies there had been, how often I’d been gaslit when I asked why she was acting off. The rose-tinted glasses came off, and I saw that things were never really good.\n\nShe had ignored me often, lashed out aggressively over nothing (especially while using), and made it impossible to bring up problems. Any attempt to talk was met with coldness, silence, or anger. The constant lying triggered all the old trauma from the cheating. I completely fell apart. My body was in constant fight or flight. I was physically sick and emotionally wrecked as I reexamined every memory through a new lens.\n\nTwo weeks after I found out, she got angry with me and asked when I was going to “get over it.” She never gave me the time to grieve. I felt like I didn’t even know her anymore. she had become a stranger. She was doing drugs at work, selling them, even driving under the influence. She risked everything. Every time I tried to talk to her, to find some way to fix things, she would say nothing. When I asked what she was thinking, her only response was, “that I should kill myself.”\n\nAnd still, I didn’t leave. I spiraled even further. A few months later, I was admitted to a psychiatric hospital for a month, the lowest I’ve ever been. While there, I saw a psychiatrist regularly. He helped me see how toxic everything had become. I realized that I’d learned to silence myself completely because I was never allowed to express sadness or anger without punishment.\n\nWhen I got out, I still wanted to work on things. My wife said she’d do anything. We talked about the cheating and how she’d never shown remorse. She said she didn’t think it was wrong at the time. Then, eventually, she gave me a flat, robotic apology “I’m sorry for hurting you.” She promised she’d do whatever it took to not lose me, so I stayed. But nothing changed.\n\nOur sex life was dead. I couldn’t stop thinking about the other woman. I’d lost all trust in her and in myself. I became someone I hated. I started going through her phone and found messages saying how much she loved the woman, how no one understood her like she did, and how she only stayed with me because the woman didn’t want a relationship.\n\nLast Wednesday, I finally broke. We were supposed to go to a day party together, but I got a migraine that morning and stayed home. The party ended at 3 p.m., and there was an afterparty until 8. I asked her to please come home at 4 and skip the afterparty. We had plans that night, and she agreed. I even put on lingerie as a surprise for when she got home. But then she stopped messaging me. 5pm passed, then 6, then 7. She decided to go to a different venue for the afterparty and didn’t even tell me.\n\nThis wasn’t new. She often stayed out drinking without letting me know when she’d be home, even when we had plans. I lost it. I went completely numb. I slept on the couch that night. she was too drunk to reason with.\n\nThe next day, I told her I was thinking about leaving. She went cold again. I kept trying to talk, to explain everything I felt, but her only response was that she wanted to kill herself. I asked if I could stay with my mother for a week, and she said that if I left, she would self-harm. That was when I realized there was no point anymore. I had loved her blindly, given her everything, and received almost nothing in return.\n\nA few days ago, we finally had a proper discussion. She begged me not to leave. She cried, said she would change, that she’d become the perfect partner I deserved. She said she regretted everything and that if she could go back, she’d do it all differently. But it’s too little, too late. I’d given her so many chances. It shouldn’t take me finally saying I’m done for her to recognize that the cheating, lying, manipulating, ignoring me, and doing drugs were wrong.\n\nI told her I’d give her three months, which I know is probably foolish, and she agreed. She might actually change, but I don’t think it would matter. It’s too late. I’ve given everything I could. At least at the end of those three months, I’ll know I truly tried. It gives me time to plan an exit strategy.\n\nI can’t stop crying. Even after everything, I don’t want to leave. But deep down, I know it’s what’s best.\n",

      "selftext": "Trigger Warning: This post contains discussion of infidelity, betrayal by close friends, public humiliation, grief, and emotional trauma.\n\nI thought I had healed from my husband’s affair with my best friend and the betrayal of my closest friends, but years later, I still feel like I’m drowning. And now, I think I like someone again. I’m starting to trust him, and it terrifies me. I second-guess everything about my feelings and instincts, because the last time I trusted this deeply, it broke me in ways I didn’t think I could survive.\n\nA few years ago, I found out my husband was having an affair with my best friend. (I learnt about the affair during this month but a few years back). We were both married, and the whole thing became very public — our church, his workplace, and even my workplace all found out. Total strangers would come up and talk to me about it. I’ve never felt so exposed or humiliated.\n\nHe was the first person I ever truly felt I belonged with. Being with him had actually healed a lot of old trauma for me, and I thought we were solid. He preached and did music at church, and she led Sunday school and was a deacon. When it came out, they separated, and we eventually moved thousands of km away to rebuild.\n\nI stayed because I couldn’t imagine not being with our kid every night — and because I wanted to believe we could repair things and become even stronger. He really did try and was willing to keep trying. But it was like that knife just kept twisting inside me. Over time, I became a version of myself I didn’t recognize — angry, anxious, and exhausted. I felt like I was dying inside.\n\nI finally left a couple years ago, and our divorce was finalized around this time last year. Then one of my parents died suddenly at this time last year. This month especially, everything is crashing back — the betrayal, the grief, the humiliation, the loss of my community, and the version of myself I used to be.\n\nFor anyone who’s been through something like this — does it ever really stop feeling like an open wound?\nHow long did it take before you could breathe again without it hurting so much?\nHow do you trust someone in such an intimate way again?\nHow did you get through anniversaries or reminders when everything floods back?\n\nI just want to know if there’s really a point where it stops defining your whole life, and you can feel like yourself again — and be able to trust someone again without constant fear.\n\nLooking for advice, stories of healing, or encouragement from people who’ve survived infidelity and betrayal trauma.",

      "selftext": "Unfortunately Dday was in July when I crashed down on my partners world, forever altering our relationship (my biggest regret in life). I cannot believe my selfishness and just pure stupidity that led me to do what I did when I cheated, I will never forgive myself and I do not want sympathies. \n\nWe began reconciliation early August and at first everything was going well, however over the past 2 weeks it is very clear my partner is very irritated by my presence and just me as a whole. It feels like everything I say or do annoys him, and I’m really unsure what to do in this position so I was wondering what’s best when they are filled with constant anger. I am really struggling to be positive on this journey as my partner has said quite a lot of negatives during R, most recently saying “it more feels like we are breaking up than reconciling” and “it doesn’t feel like we are in a relationship anymore”. When things like this are said I’m really unsure about what to do as it doesn’t fill me with a lot of hope. The only time he is positive about reconciliation is after we’ve had sex so I find that a little hurtful. \n\nI started therapy soon after Dday and have been reading all the books and threads to gain insight into how to be the best partner during R, however my partner rejects therapy and says he doesn’t believe In it. I’m really unsure what more can I do during this stage because it really feels like he is slipping away and I’m terrified.\nThank you",

      "selftext": "***reposted, flagged as unreadable*** \n\nShort story-  \n\nI 26M forgave my girl 25F for cheating on me, we moved in together and no longer in a long distance relationship however she gets upset whenever I bring up these guys she was texting that she had already blocked, are still texting her off of fake numbers trying to get her attention. She normally tells me right away but apparently last night and this morning someone was texting her and all she did was just delete the text, she doesn’t know that I know how to see deleted texts so I checked and she didn’t respond but also didn’t block the person. I have 4 days off so in my head she didn’t block him because she planned on responding while I was at work (I’m in the military and she stays at home).She definitely made massive improvements on all levels, but I can’t help but to be super skeptical on everything. Talking to her about it doesn’t work because she gets annoyed saying “I’m putting in so much effort to prove to you but you still don’t believe me” and it just turns into silence for a bit until eventually we just talk about something else etc  \n\n\nLong story- \n\nI guess our situation was unique. We met over Facebook, she’s from my home town and I was stationed in Texas. We flown back and forth for week long visits together multiple times and had been in a LDR for about a year and a half. \n\nWe went thru something major back in December. When I went and visited her in early November, she ended up pregnant. I could tell she was super excited about it, wanted to keep it, and as happy as I was, reality was all that I could think about. As much as I would like to be as delusional as her about it, we’ve never lived together, spent more than a week together so bringing a child into this world together was really a hard thing to grasp at the time. I didn’t wanna be a dad from 1900 miles away, I wanted us to live together, get situated and comfortable together before anything like that could even be spoken about. On top of it all, we’d have to be married in the military for us to actually be able to live together, benefit from it and I just didn’t feel like we were there yet. So I told her the truth on how I felt, she was super upset about it, went thru with the abortion but because I was busier than usual around that time with army life, I wasn’t there for her emotionally like I should have been. I’ll never really know exactly what she went thru because I’m a guy, don’t understand how abortions work or feel like and can only imagine the amount of stress, pain and depression it caused her. Even for a little while after that she was still fucked up about it, still talks sometimes about it to this day. \n\nShe ended up seeking emotional support from someone else, she swears it was just virtual, never beyond texting and FaceTiming. I’ll never know the truth I feel because she lied about it for so long that who knows if she’s telling the truth now. And then about 2 months ago she had another emotional affair with someone else and ended up linking together and have sex. Didn’t stop until that guys girlfriend caught them. Said she didn’t have the heart to tell me because she didn’t want to lose me. When she said that specifically, it made me feel like just some sort of comfort to her, like I’d always be there for her when she needed something, that she uses me for stability. But I try to keep an open mind because I know I didn’t do nearly enough emotionally for her as a partner should have. \n\nNot all of it was my fault, the distance definitely played a major role but at the end of the day she chose to be with me while betraying me. Can’t tell if she was also trying to monkey branch to someone else because she communicated a lot after the abortion happened that she thought I was leaving her. She definitely has some serious abandonment issues. \n\nHer way of fixing everything was driving down with everything she owned 2 weeks ago, moving into my place that I have off post and us to work on our relationship together. For the most part, she’s dedicated but what I mentioned above is something that really rubbed me off wrong the past couple of days. She also will not get off of me, not to be weird or anything but sexually she’s been on me multiple times a day, everyday since she’s been down and that also isn’t like her. Not saying it’s a bad thing, but one of my friends pointed out that having a kid with me would mean she’s set up for the next 18 years. So that’s something that pays a toll in my head as well. \n\nAnyway, back to my main question I wanted to ask you; do you ever regret staying with your partner? Did you ever gain any amount of trust back? Is the mental torment from everything that came to light worth dealing with if there’s potential?\n\n",

      "title": "My Story. Please be gentle.",
      "selftext": "This is the story of my marriage and divorce. I think I’m writing this mostly for me, but also to possibly see what some others think. I’m using a throwaway so that I can be honest.\n\nLet’s start at the beginning, around 2007. We’re both attending the same university in the US, she’s an international student and I’m an American. I was the kind of shy but smart guy from class that she knew, and she was the cute international student from Thailand. We were in a few classes over the years but in the months before I’m set to graduate and move away to a different state, we started talking more. Then we had a few in person lunch dates before I moved away.\n\nAfter I moved, we continued to talk. She was set to graduate one year behind me. I flew back into town for her graduation later that year, and then a few weeks later she had a crisis, and we decided it was best if I came to pick her up. So, I drove a few states over to pick her up in my vehicle with most of her belongings and she moved into my place just like that.\n\nWe lived in a shared house near downtown Minneapolis with around 7 other people of the same age, early 20s, which made it easy to integrate into the new city. She made friends from Thailand that were attending the University of MN. We were very into each other at this time, having sex multiple times a day and always wanting to be around each other.\n\nI worked full-time and sometimes travelled for work, when I went somewhere interesting, I would usually stay over the weekend, and she would fly out to join me. We genuinely had a good time, and I fell in love with her. She also said she loved me, and I believed her.\n\nLate 2008, and her student visa is going to expire soon. We were going to have to decide what to do. Either she had to go back home, or we had to do something. We decided to get married in the local courthouse and then apply for a fiancé K1 visa. We continued living in the same house for another year until I changed jobs and we then moved to a different state. Around this time we announced to our family and friends that we were going to get married and started all the arrangements. We applied for her K1 fiancé visa. I flew to Thailand to meet her parents and family. They are a middle class family and her father owns an insurance agency.\n\nIn 2009 We had two separate wedding ceremonies, one in the US, and one in Thailand. It was a traditional Thai wedding with all the intricacies which was very fun to be involved in. Her family had connections, and we had our wedding at a Thai Air Force base. We literally had most of the base to ourselves. We stayed in the officers' housing. After a year+ of what felt like non-stop wedding planning, we finally settled down in our new home once everything was finished. During this time we adopted a couple cats that we treated like children.\n\nThe issue of children for ourselves came up sometimes, but she was on birth control and we didn’t have plans for children any time soon. We were just enjoying our newly married lives. I continued my job that continued to involved some travel and while she was still looking for work in our new city, she would sometimes join me on my work trips which was fun for both of us.\n\nFast forward to around 2010-2011. My now wife has found a good full time job in a downtown office. She has to commute around 30 minutes each way to work Monday through Friday - this was before Zoom calls. So, we mostly saw each other briefly in the mornings and in the evenings.\n\nOne day she tells me that some of her friends from work are planning a weekend “float trip” which is kind of a camping trip by the lake. It would be in a state park around 4 hours drive from our place. She wanted to go by herself as she said it was just supposed to be her coworkers. I was like that sounds fun and I said have a good time. I trusted her 100% at this time. \n\nShortly after the float trip I noticed that she started protecting her phone more, something she never used to do. It was always with her, when before she would always leave it around and have to find it later. Sometimes asking me to call her phone so she can find it.\n\nI started getting more suspicious when she had mentioned a new friend at work. I could hardly ever reach her during work hours. She wouldn’t answer her phone and was very slow to return calls and texts. She’d arrive home later. I’d have to call her office number to see if she was still at her desk after 6pm. When she first started her job at this company downtown, I would sometimes drive up to meet her for lunch, but our lunches together seemed to stop after the time of this \"float trip\".\n\nOn the weekends, she started spending most of the time outside the house. She said she was hanging out with some friends she met at work. We started arguing more as I started asking her more questions about who this guy is when I found her phone screen with many text messages from an “LJ”. Her phone was locked, but I could still see the name. She was getting texts all the time from this person “LJ”.\n\nEventually she started spending the whole weekend away from Friday night until Sunday night. At this point I did something questionable. We had a shared laptop and I restored her iPhone backup onto my phone one of the weekends while she was away. I read her text messages and found conversations with LJ. They were cheating, but it wasn't clear if they were having sex.\n\nI was devastated but knew that if I confronted her with that now while she was outside, she would just stay outside and not come home. I waited until she returned home and then showed her some of the photos and videos that I found on her phone. One video was of her kissing LJ on the cheek while they were driving to the float trip in the car that I helped her buy. He was driving our car.\n\nAt this point, I loved her but I was absolutely devastated. Until the float trip, I thought I had a happy marriage. We seemed to love each other, we had a good sex life, we did things together on the weekends before she started hanging around her “friends from work”. My heart was broken.\n\nConfronted with the evidence in front of her eyes, I told her that I was prepared to divorce if she didn’t quit the job where she worked with LJ and agree to stay away from him. She agreed to quit her job and did so the next week. I still loved her or thought I did, so I decided to give her a second chance. This happened around two years after we had been married. She has her permanent resident / green card by this time.\n\nFast forward a couple years and I received a job offer in California. She now has a job that can easily transfer, and she’ll be able to work from home after she moves with me to California. Things are going great for us. We fly out to California a couple times to apartment shop and then decide on a place. I'm set to start my new job soon, so I'll move first and then she'll will join me. It takes her around three months to finally move, apparently because she was working on getting approval from her company to relocate. I try to put all the past infidelity with LJ out of my mind because he is now over 1600 miles away. I assume the problem is solved.\n\nOne weekend we are shopping for bicycles, we thought it would be a fun thing to do as a couple in our new city. She left her phone in my car unlocked. I looked at it and saw she had messages from LJ again. My heart stopped. I waited until she got back into the car, I told her what I just saw and said that “I thought we were going to start fresh after we moved to California”. I don’t recall what she said to answer me but the ride home was in silence. It really ruined what was an otherwise pleasant afternoon together.\n\nThe next few years are rough, we’re fighting a lot more and sometimes going without sex for months. She continued to take her birth control pills. I asked her about it one day, why she was taking them still if we never had sex. She said she needed to take them to help her skin. I was pretty sure that she was cheating but I had started drinking more to help tune it all out. That became another source of arguments, my drinking. The drinking became a problem and sometimes I was drinking 12 or more beers in a day. Most days I got into the routine of drinking in the evening, while she would be upstairs doing her thing if she was home. Not a healthy combination for a marriage. \n\nFast forward to 2017. I had left one of her metal bowls that she got from Thailand outside for the neighborhood dogs to drink as it was hot outside. She comes home to see her “special bowl” outside and we have a blow up fight about it. Enraged, she ends up throwing the bowl at me and it hit me, injuring my elbow. It drew blood. I called 911 and the police came out. She didn’t get arrested as I told them not to, but they had her leave, and she stayed in a hotel for the night. During the night she withdrew $35,000 from our joint savings account that was supposed to be used for a down payment on a home. Naturally, I demanded that she return the money, but she refused. I started talking to a divorce lawyer but for some reason decided against filing right then. I couldn’t do anything about it really, except stew. Unfortunately, I started to resent her. But I didn’t really want to go through a divorce, yet. I didn’t feel ready to go through all that hassle and expense.\n\nI thought maybe a nice vacation to Hawaii would help us get our marriage back into the groove. We book a vacation and she helps plan it, but it’s a struggle. On the vacation there was lots of arguing. We had sex a few times which was nice to know that we could still do that, but it was awkward. She just laid there. It’s not enjoyable for me if I see my partner is clearly not into it, so it was a turn off.\n\nShortly after we returned home from vacation in November 2018, I stop drinking for good. The new sober clarity finally laid bare what I had been trying to avoid by drinking - my wife was having an affair and wasn't going to end it. I wasn’t sure at that point if she was physically cheating as I had no hard evidence, but I still had strong suspicions. I couldn’t take it anymore. There was a total lack of trust. I file for divorce.\n\nShe immediately hires an attorney and asks for temporary spousal support and gets awarded it. Because we were married more than ten years and California considers our marriage long term, I was potentially on the hook for permanent alimony. She wouldn’t agree to anything at first, so I had to fight hard in court because I did not want to be paying her permanent alimony. My attorney eventually got her to agree to three years of spousal support, a five-figure amount at signing the settlement, then half of my 401k. She paid me nothing, but I got my freedom back.\n\nI shouldn’t, but recently I Googled her name and found she and “LJ” are listed as living in the same address. All that time she told me that he was nothing, just a friend. If you read down this far, thank you.",

      "selftext": "Hi, question for everyone here.\n\nI was with my spouse for 10 years, we have a kid together. Long story short: he was a serial cheater for our entire relationship. A week ago I found out he’s been sleeping with some person for 6 months, and talking to them for a year and a half. (I assume the 6 months thing is a lie though.)\n\nThis is by far the worst thing he’s ever done to me and I’m done. The fact that he could repeatedly cheat and act like nothing was happening for months is beyond me.\n\nThe problem with leaving him is I’m kinda broke by myself. I have some income but not a lot. My brother currently lives with my mom, and they’ve invited me to live in their living room temporarily, until the spring when my brother and I would find an apartment together. He can’t move sooner because he’s on the lease w my mom. The problem with this is my son and I would be sharing that room until the spring, and my mom and I don’t do well living together. She’s already set up a bunch of rules for me, that I would obviously follow since it’s her house, but I know I’ll be miserable living with my mom. \n\nMy only other viable option is to stay living in my current place with my ex. My ex has offered to live in our living room until my brother and I can move. I already bought myself new bedroom furniture so he’d essentially turn our current living room into his bedroom. I’d keep our current room, and our son would stay in his. The problem with this is that I’d be living with my ex and that doesn’t feel very separated to me. My ex likes to pretend that problems don’t exist, and acts like we’re still together when we’re not. \n\nMy ex is not abusive or mean, and we actually get along very well in every other aspect of our life. I am thinking about our son and I wonder if us living together temporarily is better than making him live in a small living room with me? I really dont know. I’m trying to balance what’s best for me with what’s best for my son here. Is having his 2 parents together for a little while longer better? We dint argue in front of him often, and I don’t think we’ll start now, so it’s not like that will be an issue. Has anyone done this? Is it a bad idea? ",

My husband and I both want to go to therapy and really try to fix things. We know there’s no guarantee, but we believe we can work through this, and if we eventually realize we’d be happier apart, we at least want to know we tried and can walk away with some closure.\n\nI start my own therapy tomorrow, but I’d like to get us into marriage counseling as soon as possible, hopefully next week. I need someone who will address my trauma first and help my husband truly understand how deeply his actions affected me. I’m not sure he fully gets it yet, and I know that’s something we’ll have to work through with help.\n\nWe originally wanted in-person sessions, but our work schedules are hard to line up, so online might be our best option. We’ll both be doing individual therapy, so, unfortunately can’t afford to pay much out of pocket—ideally insurance-covered or under about $50 per session.\n\nHas anyone found success with online couples therapy after infidelity? Any platforms or specific sites you’d recommend (like Talkspace, ReGain, or others)? I’d love to hear what worked for you, especially if your therapist really understood betrayal trauma.\n\nThanks in advance for any advice or personal experiences ❤️",

      "title": "My Husband chose the AP",
      "selftext": "My husband and I have been married for three and a half years. A year ago we welcomed our baby into this world. I always wanted to be a mom, I told him so when we first met and he always said he didn't care whether we had a baby or not, that as long as I was by his side he would be happy. Well I got pregnant, a little sooner than we had hoped (by a couple months/a year) but it was a high risk pregnancy, we couldn't really be intimate the first trimester (even though we still were a couple times)  afterwards we did have intercourse just not as often as he would have liked. We were both working 12-16 hour days Mon-Friday and had little energy on the weekends to do anything but hang around the house. Then baby came, and we became roommates. But this is just a phase! All couples experience massive change after baby comes right? I didn't get much help from him or anyone else, I went from working to being a SAHM, by choice. But we barely talked, hung out even less, and sex was nonexistent. I wasnt on Birth control and he refused to use condoms so we had sex maybe 10-12 times in the past year. I had people tell me how irresponsible it was to have sex in the same room as the baby even if they were sleeping and I struggled with some PPA and paranoia so I was scared I would screw my baby up. The few times we did manage to have sex it was painful or we woke the baby up. He would go back to bed and I had to console the crying baby. Dates were also nonexistent, I encouraged him to go out with friends and he did but I felt pressured to be with my baby 24/7 because I was scared of judgement and I was anxious to leave my baby.\n\nWell he asked me for a divorce and I heard the infamous words: I love you but Im not in love with you. I was shocked, sure we had drifted apart but I was almost one year post partum, I was going to stop breastfeeding, start feeling more like myself and we were going to rekindle the flame! At first I just said ok, I was in too much shock. But then I fought it, I asked him if there was anyone else and he denied it. I got told I was not affectionate enough, not intimate enough, he walked on egg shells around me (he was not really a hands on father, I felt burnt out, Ill give him this). I carried the guilt with me everyday, I couldn't eat, couldn't sleep, I felt so guilty my actions cost my baby her family. I did the pick me dance, I became the perfect wife. I tried having sex with him but he didn't want to because \"his heart wasn't in it\" okay... I asked him for nothing. I took care of everything, so that when he got home he didn't have to do a single thing. I booked couples therapy and planned dates. Three weeks went by and nothing. He just didn't have romantic feelings for me and he didn't think anything could change.\n\nThen I found out, she was a coworker and it never raised a flag because they were screwing in his office, probably next to the family pictures that sat on his desk. Yes she knew about me and my baby. But he defended her, he said she wasn't a bad person. I told him that I had packed all my things and the baby's things and we were moved out. He cried, but the next day he spent the whole day with her (I didn't know) and then came to see the baby afterwards. Three days later he asked to reconcile. I was relieved and so happy that I ignored the fact that he never actually apologized. I ignored the fact that he came with a list of things I needed to work on so he could feel loved. We tried for 5 weeks with me dancing the pick me dance like my life depended on it, but in the end I couldn't compete, she was exciting and they \"had so much in common\" and me? I was just a boring mom who neglected her husband.\n\nI heard him tell me over and over again how he didn't love me, he loved her. So I asked for a separation and he said he wanted a divorce, he asked me to stay at my parent's (well in a studio in the same apartment building as them). He didn't know I had already gotten a job (as soon as I saw things going south I asked for my job back), but he wasn't going to give me child support or alimony, eventually I did wake up and demand child support. But he kept the apartment and the furniture. I made him buy us a bed and a dresser, he complained about not having money but he was going out all the time with her.\n\nHe barely saw our baby so I told him to step up or leave us alone, he stepped up at least. It's been a month and a half since we left, I know he went \"legit\" with her but he hasn't told me (or our friends) anything directly. I see him put all this effort in with her but he wouldn't even watch the baby for me to shower. I would go days without showering how was I supposed to feel sexy enough to screw? He told me our marriage was dead even before the affair. It was unhappy, suffocating, and loveless. I pretended I was unaffected, I told him we could rekindle our love, we could fall back in love again. But it was no use, I can't compete with her.\n\nHe couldn't even wait till my baby was one? He couldn't have given me a fair fighting chance? Im so hurt and yet I can't break down because my baby needs a stable parent. I know I deserve better, someone who wouldn't have abandoned me, someone who would have been patient and understanding. But my heart just misses the man I married, my heart is broken for my daughter. I struggle with letting go, I don't want to accept that this is my reality because I don't want to give up yet, but he's gone. He chose her and the only reason he tried to reconcile was because she had walked away and he was scared to be alone. I was his consolation prize until she returned.",

He blamed me and said I drove him away and he fell out of love bc I don't know how to love him correctly. I was blindsided and had texts, voice notes, cards, notes all saying differently. The breakup was hard, the cheating made it even worse. I was/am heartbroken and have to remain in the same house until it sells. \n\nI'm in therapy and leaning on friends. I am building a support system after years of being isolated. And yes, I'm telling people the truth. I have their messages, pictures, maps activity and no issue working through this trauma by talking to my support system about my findings. It's not a reality TV show but when people ask what happened I let them know. \n\nHe doesn't appreciate this and says I'm making it more dramatic than what it is, that he just fell out of love. He hates that people know he cheated and said he will stop being civil if it continues. He doesn't get to break me and still control the narrative \n\n\n",

I have been having an incredibly difficult time with it. I used to monitor everything. Constantly checking his socials, his emails, his calls and texts. I had been cheated on during my first marriage when I was pregnant and my fiancé had known about this from the being that it is something I struggle with in relationships because of betrayal trauma. My fiancé knew about my past and he had cheated on me for at least until last year in July. When I was pregnant with our son. The feeling of being cheated on while your pregnant cuts deep. He broke me mentally and emotionally when I discovered his extensive cheating escapades.  \n\nWell the betrayal trauma has increased immensely. I am paranoid, hyper-vigilante about anything and everything. I finally told my therapist and she said I just need to stop trying to monitor everything. If he wants to cheat he will cheat. That really opened my eyes so I stopped everything. It had become too mentally and emotionally draining to constantly do it. \n\nI didn’t realize I had such a fear about him having female friends until today. I had noticed a woman ,let’s call her Jill, had sent him TikTok’s because he was showing me something on his phone when the notification had popped up. I had asked who Jill was and why are they sending TikTok’s to each other. He said it is his co-worker. I have heard him mention her name a time or two. But he never mentioned their communications. \n\nAll of the emotions I felt back when I had found out he had cheating on me hit me like a freight train once again. I had a huge panic attack about it today after discovering this. All the fears, the pain, the betrayal, the anguish I had felt all at once again was overwhelming. He did get defensive about it though he did apologize for his actions and said he was in the wrong for how he acted. I just can’t get it out of my head at all. It did throw me off why he became so defensive. \n\n I don’t know how to process this at the moment. I don’t know how to begin to process and be comfortable with him having female friends right now.

It remained emotional because AFAIK they had only met once, which was when they first met at a work conference. Fast forward to now, wife has filed for divorce and we are going through the divorce process.\n\nHowever, she took our son to Florida for a \"vacation\". While I approved the trip thinking it was just her and our son, she did not disclose that she would be meeting up with the affair partner and his older son. I find that out from my son (who is 4 YO) when they come back. From what he has recounted, he slept in a separate room with this other person's older son unsupervised while my wife and the affair guy slept in a separate room.\n\nMy thoughts are that this is both incredibly disturbing and reckless, that a mother would leave her 4YO son unsupervised with basically a stranger and an older man who knowingly is destroying our son's family. \n\nI could really use some insight and advice. Am I within reason to feel this was incredibly disturbing and reckless? And what should I do about this? I plan to mention it to my divorce lawyer, as to me it feels like something potentially relevant to determining custody given how (IMO) neglectful of safety this was. I have not confronted my wife about this yet.\n\nThank you for any thoughts you'd be willing to share! ",

She was charming, full of life, and made me feel like I could finally slow down and enjoy what I’d built. I own my house, run a small business, and have always been pretty comfortable financially. She used to joke that I was “stable in a world full of chaos.” I took that as a compliment. Looking back, maybe that was the first red flag. She quit her job six months into dating because she said her workplace was toxic. I didn’t think much of it I helped out a bit, covered rent, groceries, trips. It felt natural when you care about someone. We got married earlier this year. I paid for most of the wedding, honeymoon, everything. It didn’t bother me at the time I just wanted her to be happy. But right after the honeymoon, something changed. She became cold, distant, always “too tired” or “too busy.” Her phone suddenly had a password.\n\nTwo weeks ago, I found out why. A mutual friend sent me screenshots she’d been messaging another guy for months, calling him her “backup plan.” I couldn’t breathe reading that. She told him she’d “secured the house” and was just waiting to “figure out the next move.”\n\nWhen I confronted her, she didn’t even deny it. She said she “needed stability” and that “it’s not her fault I can afford things she can’t.” She’s gone now, but I’m left here staring at the wreckage financially I’ll be fine, emotionally not so much. I keep asking myself how I missed the signs. How someone can fake love that well.\n\nHas anyone else realized, too late, that your partner never loved you they just loved the lifestyle you gave them?",

I told him before we got together that I wanted them and if he didn't, we could be friends but we probably shouldn't try being together. He then said he did want them but was scared. We got married, he'd say we'd have kids, then he cheated and left instead. Then it became he never wanted kids. Not in a \"eh I'm on the fence\" but like vehemently and angrily \"I do not want to be a father. I wouldn't be good at it. I'm happy being an uncle.\" \n\nI've always known he'd end up having kids and I found out last week that I was right. He's just become a father. To twins. He confirmed it in maybe the douchiest way possible and, when I said \"I thought you didn't want kids,\" he said \"I'm still not entirely convinced I want to be a father but it's out of my control now.\" Another lie, clearly. \n\nEven though I knew it would happen, I'm devastated. I'm nearly 40, I have no one and most likely won't get to have kids. He has everything I want and he never even wanted it. How is it fair? I know, I know, life isn't fair. But come on. This man lied to me for years, treated me so badly, and gets to go off and have a fabulous life. I was the loyal one, I was the \"kindest person\" he ever knew, I was the one who loved him even when I should have ditched him. But he's the happy one. And I keep beating myself up - maybe if I hadn't gotten mad that one time, or maybe if I had been happier or prettier or whatever - he'd have wanted kids with me. Or he wouldn't have cheated. And I know he's responsible for his own actions AND I know that, objectively, he just moved on and now he's ready to be a father. But he started that relationship in such a shitty way - and has not behaved all that well at times - that I can't imagine she'd be happy if she knew what he was doing or what he was saying. Yet he gets a happy ending anyway.\n\nI know I can adopt or try to have a family another way, but it's just absurd. I don't understand. I'll never understand. I don't understand what's wrong with me, I don't understand why literally everything in my life is going against me. Is this a very whiny post? Yep, bc I'm so sad. I can't keep trying to convince myself things are going to get better when it's not. This person who can't talk about his emotions or be honest or be loyal is a father. A father. Twins! ",

After a couple of months i called my mother in law to ask why and she told me “well we’ve never been friends”.   \n\nI had been their daughter in law for almost 30 years. I’m the only one they have. I’m the mother of their only grandchildren.  We’d had countless family gatherings over the years at Christmas and birthdays, I’d always given thoughtful gifts and thought I rubbed along with them quite nicely.  She’d been a good mother in law to me and I loved and respected her.  \n\nOnce the dust had settled they started asking to talk to me and for me to visit them with my husband.  I refused and it has now been 4.5 years since I saw or spoke to them.  I don’t have any involvement in their birthday cards or gifts and I don’t want to hear about them at all so my husband knows not to talk about them to me.  Several of their birthdays have been forgotten by my husband in the last few years so they should know by now that it was always me for all those years.  \n\nMy WH doesn’t like that I won’t reconcile with them but accepts my stance. His parents won’t accept it though.  \n\nAs far as I am concerned I went through the worst period of my life without them so what could they possibly have to offer me now?",

      "selftext": "13 years together, she’s cheating while I’m sick and wants me to stay as roommate/babysitter**\n\nI don’t even know where to start with this. My wife (38F) and I (38M) have been together 13 years. We met at work, she actually pursued me pretty hard until I gave in. Never regretted it though, or at least I didn’t until now.\n\nFor over a decade I never once worried about her cheating or anything like that. We had total trust. She was always telling me we were soulmates and I actually believed that shit. We liked all the same stuff - working out, anime, sports, same music mostly. We just clicked.\n\nWe’ve got two kids, 6 and 2. I’m really close with them, always have been. We went through some really hard times together too. Like 2 years ago I had to go to rehab for 56 days to get sober. No contact the whole time and she had the kids by herself. It was brutal but we made it work. Every time something hard came up we got through it together and it just proved to me that what we had was real.\n\nSo this summer I got really sick. Bad sinus infection that the doctors kept fucking up the treatment for. I was in bed for weeks on serious pain meds. Could barely move most days.\n\nRight when I’m at my worst, she starts going out all the time with this “new friend.” Look I’m not usually the type to care if she goes out, but I needed her around because I literally couldn’t take care of the kids myself. She has the car with the booster seats in it so I couldn’t even drive them to school.\n\nShe starts telling me she’ll be home at a certain time and then just… doesn’t come home. Won’t answer texts. Won’t pick up her phone. Sometimes she wouldn’t come home at all and the kids would miss school because I had no way to take them. This happened like 20 times. I’d be up all night sick as hell and panicking because I had no idea where she was.\n\nWhen I finally confronted her she said she didn’t know why she kept doing it but then she just kept doing it anyway.\n\nSo I got suspicious for the first time ever. Told her I was worried something else was going on. We had this long talk about boundaries and what’s ok and what’s not. She spent an entire hour lying straight to my face because not even an hour later she put her phone down and I saw a message with a half naked pic and a text that said “t-6 days until you can fuck me” to some random dude. And there were messages to another guy too.\n\nI felt like I got punched in the stomach. This woman? The one who told me every day that we were soulmates? I never would have believed it.\n\nI tried talking to her again, tried to figure out what I wasn’t giving her or what was wrong. More lies. A couple days later something felt really off and I asked to see her phone. She tried deleting stuff real quick but I stopped her. Found a message that said “you’re so fucking hot, it was amazing laying beside you in bed the other night.”\n\nFuck.\n\nAnd she just kept disappearing on me. Kept leaving me with everything while I’m barely functioning on disability. Then I find out she told this guy that I drugged her and she doesn’t feel safe around me. What the actual fuck? That never happened. She completely made that up and now she’s telling people that shit about me.\n\nI got mad and told her to leave. And honestly there’s way more to this story but this is already getting long.\n\nHere’s where I really need help. She doesn’t want to actually separate. She wants to keep living together, split the bills, have me watch the kids and handle everything at home while she goes and stays the night at this dudes place whenever she wants. She expects me to just be cool with it and figure out how to be roommates or whatever.\n\nIt feels like she just wants me around to make her life easier while she does whatever she wants. And she keeps saying little things that give me hope that maybe she’ll snap out of this, which I think is just to keep me from actually leaving.\n\nI’m supposed to go back to work in a week but I’m a fucking wreck. I started therapy but it’s only been once a week. Watching her just live this whole other life while I’m stuck here is killing me.\n\nI don’t understand why she couldn’t just talk to me. Give me some kind of heads up or a chance to fix whatever was wrong. The way she did this was so cruel and it’s not like her at all. Some people think she might be having a manic episode or something but I don’t know if that even matters at this point.\n\nThe problem is I can’t afford to move out right now. I’m on medical EI and I don’t have anywhere to go. And I don’t want to leave my kids.\n\nSo do I just suck it up and stay here being the stable parent while she’s off with this guy? Even though it’s destroying me? Or do I figure out some way to leave even though I have no money and nowhere to go?\n\nI genuinely don’t think I’ll ever be able to trust anyone again after this. And I can’t shake the feeling that this is somehow my fault even though everyone keeps telling me it’s not.\n\nIf anyone’s been through something similar or has any advice I’d really appreciate it. I’m trying to keep my shit together for my kids but I don’t know what the right move is here.\n\nPlease ask questions. \n",

      "title": "anger & hurt turned to deepening depression and withdrawal (1 year following betrayal, lies)",
      "selftext": "Hi everyone, so sorry to meet you all in this way but I am hoping to get some perspective.\n\nMy partner (28M) and I (28F) live together and have been together 3 years now, but everything changed about 1.5 years ago, when I became suspicious and discovered an emotional affair of his with a coworker (23F). They had been sending flirtatious messages for weeks and going out for drinks and other outings after work (with others there too, but with something special between them). At the time when I found out I had been VERY in love, so I was trying so hard to avoid the pain, and confronted him but gave myself time to figure out what to do. \n\nOne reason I didn’t leave immediately was bc he initially lied about the extent of their relationship and it took me 5 months to uncover everything I now know, like how they talked about how they felt in person with each other. Those 5 months were extremely painful, because I would try to believe him then discover more (that there were not just DMs but texts, that she was somewhere at the same time when he was out (after me knowing they liked each other and confronting him, etc.)\n\nThis all came to me as a huge surprise regarding his character. Everyone knows him as a very sweet empathetic person and in general I still think he is. He is generous and giving in many ways, and at this point, about a year from my final discoveries and confrontation, I believe he deeply regrets his behavior. I believe nothing sexual physically happened between them, but I guess I’ll never know for sure since I do know he is willing to lie to me. Directly and including  promises that x didn’t happen when it did etc.. for 5 months straight.\n\nI read somewhere that 18 months is a standard recovery timeline for betrayal, and I guess it’s been 12 months. I felt angry for so long, and now I feel almost .. like the romantic adoration and love I had for him has been.. neutralized? I still care deeply for him but I’m.. so depressed. I’m a very romantic person and I think he shattered my heart a year ago.\n\n[*It may also contextualize my deep sorrow that in a previous (abusive) relationship I was cheated on A LOT*]\n\nI think what hurts most is the knowledge and memory of his persistent lies, denials, stories over a long time period. I could have gotten over him just being interested in someone else.\n\nI’m willing to wait longer or make other lifestyle changes to see if my depression can be resolved but I’m also worried about myself, like I feel this way because I stayed and like I wont get better if I continue this way. Sunken. Trying to accept something and trying to forget. I am still somewhat functional and sometimes feel content, but I fear there is a growing apathy and disconnect from myself and life. \n\nMy biggest question is, if things have gotten better but I still feel this pain to the extent that I often want to leave, how can I trust myself to decide one way or the other? \n\nThank you for any feedback, please go easy on me.

      "title": "He cheated and I'm still struggling 6 months later",
      "selftext": "I've been married to my husband(39y) for 7 years. We have 2 children, 4y and 11mo old. \n\nI started feeling he was getting weird, distant, indifferent, coming home late, not as affectionate when I got pregnant the second time around. I brought it up to him a few times, and he was blaming stress at work and my \"pregnancy hormones\". He was also not intimate anymore although I was constantly initiating, again blaming stress at work and saying that it weirded him out to have s*x knowing baby is inside, which to a point I understood, but he would also refrain from other types of physical intimacy. I brought it up a few times with him, because the physical and emotional distance made me doubt he was potentially cheating on me..to which he was saying no he hasn't. \n\nFast forward to when baby was born, he became more distant. I brought up the conversation again, baby was 2 months at that point. He was saying that he has been feeling emotionally disconnected from me and that he has been feeling that he has been having to pretend a lot to make people happy. We made some time to talk about it but he was talking in circles..he was so vague. He admitted he had been seeing a therapist for some issues...I had asked him if he wanted to tell me about them and he got mad and said it bothers him that I asked. I respected that, but I started to think the issue is deeper. \n\nI brought up the subject again after countless nights him not coming back home at night at all and lying about his wareabouts ( he would say he's at work but when I would contact his colleagues they would say he either didn't show up or that he left early in the am). He answered that if I don't trust him that it's best we seperate. I suggested couples counseling a few times and it was a big nono for him, to which I thought fine maybe men don't like to talk about feelings in front of strangers idk. At that point I knew a normal person would not suggest such a thing to their postpartum spouse..it was clear for me he wanted out. He was overall distant and reserved and would get mad because I was also starting to become a bit distant too.\n\nTwo weeks later I followed him after his golf game and he entered someone's house. I wasn't able to stay long enough to see how long be stayed, who it was , but I looked up the address and it was a friend of mine I wasn't really friends with anymore...it was later confirmed with other friends of mine that they have been seen hanging out multiple times.\n\nThat day I wasn't able to confront him, I asked him I wanted some space when he came back ..and he said that he'll take his stuff and leave. \n\nWe spoke a week later, and he admitted that he's been cheating multiple times with multiple women from even before our eldest son was born..and that recently it's been even more. I didn't even tell him I had stalked him...I didn't even need to.\n\nHe didn't even try to fight for our marriage , it felt just so easy for him to just leave the second I asked for space (little that I know he was just waiting for that). \n\nThe cheating hurts, the lying and concealing..why did he want a second child? What did I do wrong? I'm not perfect and take blame for this failed marriage, communication and being vulnerable and raw about my emotions has been difficult in our early marriage, but Ive worked a lot through it and got better, he had even acknowledged that. \n\nI still feel immense sadness when I think about the cheating and how much he took advantage of me, let alone what is so wrong with me that I didn't see who he really is? \n\nI understand hes struggling with deep issues, and I feel bad for him..He's been cheating on me and I feel bad for his issues. That makes me feel pathetic.\n\nI just feel I'm so lost now and lost a lot of self confidence. Self care is almost non existent given I take care of two little ones.\nHe was very busy with work, and so I learned to rely a lot on myself and was doing a lot of the work at home, cooking, cleaning, laundry everything related to the kids, on top of my physician career and part time business I started.\n\nI think back and say to myself, was there something I could have done better, why didn't I see any signs, and when does the pain of cheating lifts. It just feel something so well anchored in me broke. I've started counseling too so hopefully that will help unlock the grief.\n\n\n",

If so where should I go I’m broke and he will kick me out \n\n*Update*\n\nThank you to those who were kind and those who were not so much. I have been going to therapy for years and we have been going to couples therapy for almost a year. Our communication is very open and he was aware I needed more from him for months. That’s the reason I confided in someone else cause nothing was changing but that was a mistake. We are both broke, him from going to school and me from supporting him during an episode where he couldn’t go to school or work. I told him and he was upset rightfully so we had a long and painful talk and he is going to give me another chance I don’t deserve him and will spend the rest of my life trying to be worthy or him and gain back his trust I I might never but I’ll try. We also made a list of things I can work on in therapy and life and am hoping to change who I am and in a year or me not be the same person who would make this horrible decision. ",

      "selftext": "I am a first time poster here. I read articles here and there, find myself googling questions and a lot of my answers are on Reddit. So I thought I would reach out for some help. Backstory: I am a married woman, with children. A few years ago it came out that my husband was a porn addict. He didn’t admit to everything that I found, but enough of what I found almost destroyed our marriage. I found tons of terrible things. Pictures, emails, cheating apps, and infidelity sites. So many inappropriate and unfaithful things. All of it broke me. I stayed. Not sure if that was the best decision or not, but I really need this marriage to work. To date there really isn’t any transparency, and that’s just how it has to be if I want to stay. It sucks, I worry a lot, and I still don’t trust him. I have access to very little, but one thing I do have access to is our cell phone plan since it was in my name And he joined my plan when we got married. My question is, I noticed that he was utilizing a ton of data through his hotspot on his iPhone and pretty consistently. He has Wi-Fi at work, but he cannot look at porn or anything else inappropriate on his Wi-Fi server at work Otherwise I imagine he would get in pretty big trouble. He is not supposed to be looking at porn, or on any other dating sites or anything else that has to do with infidelity or porn. He told me there have been a couple times he had to use his I phone’s hotspot for his work laptop when he was on the train to work. To prep for a meeting and such. He says that his laptop must just automatically connect to his hotspot from time to time like when he disconnects from his desk to walk down to a conference room for a meeting, which still has the same work Wi-Fi capability. I don’t understand why it would kick him off and then automatically connect to his hotspot. Without him knowing. Like he has no idea that he is on his hotspot Internet.\n\nAnyhow, I hope I am making sense explaining this properly. I don’t believe him. I think he is lying. I’m not entirely sure what he could be doing, he is either using another device to look up inappropriate things or websites. Could he be using his own phone turning the Wi-Fi off, utilizing his hotspot for cellular data? Could he look up information in that way on his cell phone or does it have to be a separate device?\n\nI honestly don’t know what it is that he is doing so I am seeking advice. What do you think he is doing? Is it possible that what he is saying is true? His laptop just automatically sometimes connects to his hotspot without him realizing it? Please be kind with your responses, it has been an extremely rough few years for me. My heart is still very broken and I just need some guidance here. For the record, I have been in therapy since this happened. I have continued to work on myself best I can. I am trying to make the marriage work, but I need to know the truth. Am I wasting my time? Is he lying again? What is it that he is doing? What could he be doing?",

Anything else I missed?\n\nBeing the complete moron that I am. I ignored the good advice from the people on this thread and ended up emailing my wife the letter. She made no mention of it but last night I got a hug and some affection in bed while we talked (arm rubbing and lay on chest). This morning I got another hug while I was making breakfast for her.  Apparently, the most minimal in basic affection that can be shown to your spouse, was supposed to heal a two year affair in 15 months of neglect after the affair and not helping the healing process processing or reconciliation of our marriage.\n\nThen I got to work (where she also works lucky me!) and things returned to being crappy.  If she read the email, I think that the two hugs and minor affection was about all the effort she could put forth.  It tracks pretty well with the other attempts of healing that she’s done. She can do some nice stuff for a few hours maybe a few days tops and then that resentment and discuss she has toward me kick back in. There’s only so long you can fake it I guess.\n\nIn terms of an attorney, I guess we’ll just get there when we get there if it ends up there. I honestly don’t care much about the physical possessions and the financial end of things. I’m a pretty simple guy and I know I’ll be OK either way I already messed up and deleted phone conversations I had recorded of her and her AP so I’ll just add all of this to the collection of mistakes I’ve made through this whole process.\n\nThanks to everyone who contributes to this form and give support to the people going through this terrible situation   ",

      "selftext": "I’ll open this thread by sharing something I did that I’m not proud of. This morning I looked at my wife’s phone and specifically her Facebook messenger conversation with a male friend of hers. \n\nI have been sitting with a thought since May that there could be something going on between them that wasn’t just a friendship. \n\nThere have some subtle clues that I just couldn’t shake. I have shared my concerns that something may be going on there, not specifically with this guy, but a general concern that I was fearing she was straying from our marriage. We have struggled with intimacy for a while and some other life events and losses have hit us (more so her) and I had been attributing a lot of or lack of physically intimacy to those related external factors\n\nSome additional background. Last January (2024) we lost her father. She was very close to her father. Much closer to him than her mother. Her relationship with her mother has always been rather strained to say the least. And since the loss of her father, her mother has been very needy and frankly uncaring of my wife’s emotions. In fact, my wife unloaded a several weeks back and made a statement that she really hasn’t been able to grieve her father’s loss properly because of her mother. \n\nNow, a few months prior, this male friend of hers lost his mother. From what I understand, he was very close to his mother and took the loss very hard. My wife is generally a good person and was there for him. So much so that she spent the entire day of the funeral with him and his family helping them navigate through the day. \n\nI shared that background because I feel it’s important. My wife is a self soother, and she shared that with me later on the night that her father passed. I was trying to console her not really knowing how considering the situation. She has never come to me asking for any help in grieving or consoling and I haven’t pushed, but made sure she knew I was always there if she ever needed something and would be there for ever she did need. \n\nIt is also worth noting, that during this time we had our fur baby (dog) that was also going through some health issues and as a result, one of was always home to tend to his needs. This meant my wife would go visit her mother, who lives about 45 minutes way, by herself. Up until this point, we would always visit together and take our fur baby with us. \n\nHer mom and her male friend live in the same town. \n\nWith both her and her friend experiencing the same impactful loss so close together, I know they remained in contact and she would often stop by his place for a quick visit after visiting with her mother. As far as I know, this was only an occasional thing and she always let me know she was stopping there. Never thought twice about it. I felt that if it was helpful, then she should. \n\nFast forward to May. Mother’s Day to be exact. By this time, we unfortunately lost our puppers and we decided to divide and conquer which is what we do most mothers days. She would go see her mom, I would go see mine, and that was that. \n\nWell this year, she texted me around 7:30 letting me know she was trying to escape her mothers. This is known thing, and something we joke about regularly. About an hour later I got an alert that the car was on the move. This alert was nothing sinister. We both use this particular car, but it is the one that is more reliable so it’s the one we use if driving further distances. I also just kept forgetting to cancel the subscription that triggered the alert. It came with a subscription that allowed us to remote start the car during the winter months. Living in northwest Ohio, this feature is pretty nice to have. Anyways. Didn’t think twice about it. I just assumed that she was on her way home. \n\nAfter an hour she had not yet arrived home. So I pulled up the app and looked to see where the car was expecting her to be close to house, not wanting to text her if she was driving and all. But I saw the car was at this guys house. \n\nI sat on this for another hour or so and had not gotten the alert that car was the move yet, so I texted my wife and asked if she was still trying escape, evening making a joke about it. \n\nAnother hour goes by and she texts that she escaped and I got the alert that the car was on the move. She didn’t mention that she had already left and stopped by this guys house. When she got home, she didn’t mention it either. \n\nShe did, however mention that the sale she ate for dinner with her mother had upset her stomach and she did look like she was some physical discomfort. And she also seemed like she couldn’t wait to get away from me when she first got home and ducked into the bathroom. \n\nThis was the start of my insecurity. Why did she not tell me about stopping to this guy?  Why did she mask the visit making me think she was still at her mother’s?  Was she really not feeling well?  Or did she just want to get away from me in fear that I might catch wind of something on her?\n\nI asked her about the next morning and asked if she stopped anywhere else before heading home. She did admit that she stopped at this guys house to drop something’s off and that was only a quick, like 45 minute visit. My wife has no sense of time so not really much to read into that statement. I then stated something about being worried that maybe something was going in general terms. She denied and listed off some reasons on why that would not happen, but they were all kind of superficial in my opinion. \n\nThis situation lead me down a path of self reflection and I did discover that I have not always been the best husband. I realized that I was not very approachable in years past and by being that way, could have kept her from brining up difficult topics. \n\nDurring the few weeks of my inward journey, another situation occurred regarding my wife and this guy. My wife and were both off work the same day and she was going about her day potting plants that she had been wanting to get to for a few weeks. Around early afternoon, I had gone into the bedroom and thought about taking a nap. A few minutes later, my wife comes to me with a concerned look on her face and asks if I minded if she went to go see Michael. She mentioned that he had stopped responding to texts and calls for a few days and was worried about him. Ok. Seems like a good reason for concern. When I said that was fine, and made remarks about her not needing my permission, she fully entered the bedroom and said that she would take care of me first by means of some oral stimulation. She then started to take care of me. I stopped her because it just seemed weird for her to do this act when she just asked to go check on this friend from a possible health issue.\n\nAbout a month ago, I sat her down and shared my self reflection journey with her and apologized and made a promise to be better. She seemed very respectful and receptive to this. I wanted to open things up between us so we could maybe start growing closer again. It was very open discussion and very infighting. She did mention that she thought, from my actions of the past, that was happy with how things were and that she wasn’t really necessarily down with how she thought I liked our relationship state at this time. She also mentioned something to the effect how she hadn’t been actively looking for an out, but was not necessarily closed off to getting out. That was hard to hear but good to hear. And we talked further and really seemed to be setting the foundation to regrow together.  Still work to do for sure, but it was a positive ending to a difficult conversation. \n\nWe just celebrated our 9 year anniversary two weekends ago and I felt it was really great. We had a lot fun and I feel really connected in a way we haven’t in a while. She even got me a gift that means a lot to me. It was something that can only be purchased for a niche online retailer, and it’s not a site that my wife ever get anything from. The item even had to be preordered and while I mentioned it several months ago, I had forgotten all about it. My forgets everything so her recalling this item really means something.\n\nI have been trying to look at all these positive things like the gift, her including me more, and her seemingly off the cuffs comments about the future and things we will do, or getting things for my workshop. All of which should tell me that she’s getting back into our relationship after both of understanding that neither of us were happy with the things where progressing and we are turning things around together.\n\nBut I still can’t shake this feeling that there is something going on with this guy. He comes up in conversations and I internally cringe. But at the surface, it always seem innocent and just a friendship. \n\nThis morning thought, I feel to weakness and when my wife was upstairs, I broke down and looked at phone. In the messenger between my wife and this guy, I saw a comment he sent. I will clean it up some for this post. He asked if she wanted him to come over and giver oral until she finished on his face. \n\nI don’t know what to do now. And my wife is now out of town with some girlfriends for a little getaway and won’t be back until Sunday afternoon. And yes, she really is with some girlfriends. This was a trip that has been planned for like 6 months and I have even heard it mentioned even by others involved in the trip. ",

      "selftext": "I've posted before. Caught my wife having an affair July 22nd when I asked who the man was she had been texting. She admitted to another affair with her boss years earlier (he was actually fired for sleeping with another female employee). \n\nMy wife immediately said she didn't want to be with me. I didn't beg or plead just asked why. She didn't have an answer. A few days later she tested the waters and discussed possible reconciliation. I said we could try counseling (I was not thinking straight). I booked counseling for the following week. \n\nThe next morning she had left. She returns a few hours later and had made an offer on a new home. I took some time off work. \n\nMy first day back she sent me a seperation agreement she had ai write. We've since secured lawyers and the agreement is done pending signatures. We are splitting the kids 50/50 and I will stay in the home. \n\nWe lived together for a month following dday. She admitted to still seeing ap though said this wasn't the reason for the separation. She said she never loved me and it was never \"right\". She rewrote history and named all these minor things she didn't like about me.\n\nMy presence started to annoy her more and more. She would leave after the kids went to bed. She would come up with reasons to stay out overnight. One afternoon I left the house and came back to no one here. She messaged and said she took the kids to her moms and would return the next day. \n\nIt was a weird month, one day she bought me a gift and tried to tell me she's not a bad person. The next day she'd get drunk and cruel. Finally after leaving for a day I asked if she'd move out. She's staying at her mom's waiting on her house to close.\n\nWe went from communicating everyday to barely speaking. I can't even look at her. She disgusts me.\n\nI can't believe how quickly everything has gone. I got a favorable deal. I believe she's in an affair fog as they say and is in a rush to start this new amazing life. Her ap didn't know she was married and apparently was upset to learn she was, not sure how he wouldn't have known but I saw text messages proving he didn't. I've heard since learning this they don't see each other often. I got the impression he wanted this done first. \n\nWe have had one talk since. She shared how kind ap is and how much she enjoys being around him. I can tell she thinks she's in love. \n\nShe says there's no immediate plans to meet the kids but it's something that coukd happen. Though she said it's not a serious relationship and can't see it going anywhere. I think she's downplaying it so she can say she didn't leave for him. For some reason to her being caught cheating and leaving isn't the same as leaving for an affair partner yet she continues to see him. \n\n\nI'm so hurt and blindsided. Never thought she'd be capable of this. \n\nJust wanted to vent. I hope she wakes up one day filled with regret for doing this to her family. Both kids are broken up about this. She says she's relieved it's over and finally feels like herself again. Not sure why the need to add being cruel to this but here we are. \n\n",

      "selftext": "This is my first time posting here. But here’s my story. My husband (37M) and I (41F) have been married 8 years, together for 11. The first 7 years were great, but something changed 3 years ago. I noticed my husband had become more withdrawn, less affectionate, less communicative. I tried to brush it off, but he came to me and said he didn’t know if he loved me or wanted to be married anymore, and actually he never wanted to marry me. He said he felt like he was just “playing a role.” I was devastated. But almost as quickly as he said it, he backtracked and said he did love me, wanted to be married, all that. I let it go and chalked it up to him just going through something. Fast forward a year and I have a dream my husband is cheating on me. I woke up and couldn’t shake the feeling so the next night as he was sleeping I snooped through his phone to find he was engaged in 2 emotional affairs. One with a coworker and another with a single mom whose son was on the same hockey team as ours. With her, he was pretending to be a single dad (long story I had a job with crazy hours so I wasn’t able to attend games/practices). They met up several times for the kids to play together. I was absolutely crushed and confronted him. Again, I got the “don’t know if I love you, want to be married, playing a role” speech. My world came crashing down. Then, again, as quickly as he said it, he backtracked and promised to cut off conversations with both. \n\nAbout 8 months later, I discovered he continued his emotional affair with his coworker. He would call her late at night and first thing in the morning and they talked all day every day. They eventually moved their conversations to a secret app. He told her awful things about me, told her he was miserable in the marriage and wanted out. He also met up with her as well. When I confronted him, he got defensive at first but then promised to cut contact because, his words, “I’m just about done talking to her anyways.” We have 3 kids together, I was desperately in love with him and wanted to make it work - so rather than grieve the betrayals I swept them under the rug and chose to believe his lies.\n\nFast forward to July of this year. He got a new job in June and works with a ton of single people, including gorgeous young women. I noticed he was getting distant again and confronted him. He admitted he was considering divorce, but when I told him he would need to leave that night, AGAIN his tune changed and he promised to change. 2 weeks later, I find out he’s trying to move out behind my back and when I confronted him, he apologized and said he’s 100% committed to us. But something snapped in me. I just didn’t believe him anymore. So i snooped his Facebook account and found he was stalking his hot 26 year old coworkers thirst traps on her socials. I’m talking multiple times a day. He also gave her his personal number. I told him how uncomfortable I was and he blew me off.\n\nFinally, 2 weeks ago, I discovered I was pregnant. I just lost it and confronted him about his obsession with her. I showed him the evidence of his stalking and kicked him out. I talked to our kids about the separation. 3 days later, I start having a miscarriage and land in the ER. He didn’t come to be with me. And two days later, I needed surgery to end the pregnancy. He left me alone in the ER. But, when I came home from rhe hospital the next day, he’d moved all his stuff back in. \n\nI’m so hurt and angry. It’s like something broke in me and I am now finally grieving his previous betrayals, his lies, his disrespect, and his current betrayals. I feel like the pain will never end. It hurts so bad, and even worse, he thinks if he just gets counseling all will be good. I’m struggling with hating his guts, being devastated, and still shocked. I don’t know how to process the betrayals, the pregnancy loss, or him just coming home with no conversation or boundaries in place.\n\nAnyway, I don’t know what I’m looking for exactly other than to vent or get support from someone who has dealt with this kind of betrayal.

      "selftext": "Context- I found out my husband is cheating with his 22 year-old coworker. He’s 34, we have one child and I’m currently pregnant with another. Obviously this is entirely his fault and I am already working on a therapist for myself as I navigate divorcing him and starting over. Obviously, I don’t think we can recover from this, but this young woman is early in her career, is someone I’ve met multiple times, and clearly knew that he was married. I don’t feel like she should get off totally free and I want her to understand that there are impacts from her actions. Obviously, I am not going to take my anger out on her or say anything hurtful, I know this is my husband’s fault - he’s the one who made a commitment to me, but I still think some outreached to her is justified. Help??\n\nDraft note below\n//\n\nC,\n \nYesterday I (unfortunately) found out about the totally inappropriate romantic relationship between you and A. While A is certainly the one to blame given that he is married with a family, you also knew what you were doing. Ultimately a married man with a child, and another child on the way, is unlikely to get together in the long-term with his inappropriately young coworker, which I’m assuming you also knew. As a young woman with career ambitions in this very small town where reputation is everything, I would strongly encourage you to not get involved with anyone’s husband in the future.\n \nI’m sure it’s easier to brush the fact that he is married under the rug when you don’t really know me, but I’m also sure you can imagine how you’d feel if you put someone you love in my shoes – a sister, cousin, friend or teammate, by getting involved with their partner. \n \nI could tell boss/company and you both would probably be fired – I’m not going to do that, but many women would.\n \nThis is A’s problem to deal with going forward, but I also thought you should know that actions like this have real world consequences, they end marriages and destroy families and force young children to be raised in broken homes- you’ll probably sleep better at night if you’re not playing any part in that.\n \nHopefully you realize just how horrible this is, and make smarter decisions about getting involved with coworkers, especially married ones, in the future. Tempting as it might be, being a girls girl is always the better way to go, it will serve you far better over the course of your lifetime.\n",

And if he’s going to do the heavy lifting…. He said before he wants to but those are just words …. ",

      "selftext": "A few months ago, my husband (35M), who works on a cruise ship, confessed that he cheated on me with a co-worker while on board. It broke me completely. \n\nWhen he came home a few weeks later, he said he wanted to fix things. He told me he regretted it, that he still loved me, and that he wanted our family to heal. I was hesitant, but I wanted to believe him because I do not want my son (4M) to have a broken family.\n\nI tried my best to be open to reconciliation. We talked and went on dates, went out as a family, and even tried to rebuild some form of normalcy. For a while, it felt like maybe we were finding our way back.\n\nWhen he was called back to work last June, I was scared because a part of me was worried he might cheat again. He promised to call more often, at least once a week, and to send updates. At first, he kept that promise. He messaged me every day, called several times a week, and reassured me that he wanted to make things right.\n\nBut after about two months, things changed. The updates became less frequent and the calls started to fade. Two weeks ago, he called everything seemed fine, normal even. Then, the next day, I found out he had blocked me on all his social media accounts. No fight, no reason, no goodbye. Just silence. I haven’t heard from him since.\n\nWe’re still legally married, but emotionally, I feel abandoned. It’s a strange kind of pain, not just from the betrayal itself, but from being left behind by someone who already broke me once. Some days I’m okay, other days I feel like I’ll never recover from this.\n\nI’m doing my best to move forward. I went to therapy and sought psychiatric help (and was diagnosed with PTSD, depression, and anxiety), but nights are the hardest because I tend to overthink.\n\nI plan to file a case against him for psychological/emotional abuse, but I’m scared he might resent me for that.\n\nI keep asking myself, will this ever get better? Will there ever come a day when I don’t think about what he did or how easily he walked away?",

He confessed to having a pornography problem as well as cheating with four coworkers now when I say cheating the first coworker, he cracked her back and gave her a back massage going to her legs during work when she had admitted she liked him and she liked married men this went on for about five or six months. There was no relationship. There was no kissing the boundaries were crossed Another woman from his work he flirted with she was a very dirty and promiscuous woman picked her up during work hours, which is completely immature, but he was flirting with her and saying oh, we could be that he could carry her and he did and then later on come to find out, he had looked up her profile on Facebook Multiple times to see her promiscuous photos The last two women from his work one he would side pump and side hug and he would check her out- he grabbed her waist and told her she didn't need to lose any weight. He also picked her up during a hug. The final woman, he flirted with, and ended up groping her behind. He said he was at first just flirting and clowning around because she was telling him she lets her friends touch her but, it's no big deal- they were having a sexy conversation about boundaries where he touched her leg and asked her if that was a boundary and when she said no, he asked her why she stands on her tiptoes to hug and then he groped her. She then told him not to kiss her and said he would not because that's intimate. I am feeling sick to my stomach. I don't know how to move past this. I have been dealing with this for six months and I think I want to divorce him. I don't know what to do. I need advice.\n\n\n\nEdit: the only reason why I know all of this is because he confessed it all to me. He felt so bad he couldn't look at himself anymore, he has not looked at pornography in two years and he has text all four of the women that he wants nothing to do with them his interactions with them were wrong and we're not worth it. He has also downloaded an app which mirrors his phone that I have access to so I have access to everything on his phone all of his keyboard entries. He says he's willing to do anything and everything. We have two children together a nine month old and a five-year-old. ",

      "selftext": "The thing is, I'm a child, and I found out last night about my dad cheating (im not entirely sure tho, the text history is the only evidence i have). My family from my mum's side has a history full of cheating and failed relationships. My great grandparents failed too. My mom has 3 sisters, all 3 of them failed either from abuse or cheating from the husbands and they have kids together. My mom Is the only one left, my dad is really nice to me but I had these suspicious since 2 yrs ago. Although I'm a kid, kids these days know pretty much everything that parents like to keep hidden from their child.\n\n\n\n2 yrs ago when my parents went for a medical checkup, I remember so vividly about my dad saying \"so i guess we trust eachother yeah?\", with the context of them discussing about the checkups, I'm thinking it was like STI and stuff, because who would talk about \"trust\" in the middle of a checkup. That sentence made me suspect him so much.\n\n\n\nI have also seen him watch many vids of random girls dancing in tiktok but I think it's pretty normal for an average man. But when I see my dad's notifications, they always have atleast one noti from a woman that's like those women who uh shake their butt to get views, saying that they followed my dad on tiktok.\n\n\n\nJust a few days ago, I peeked for my dad's password while he was unlocking his phone. So last night, while he was asleep, I took the chance to check whether he was cheating or anything. And I did NOT expect it to be so straightforward.\n\n  \nAs soon as I opened the phone, I got the noti from someone with a what seemed to be a shortened name, sending these \"🥰😊\"  I immediately opened it, thinking it was his \"friendly\" colleague, but I was wrong, the WHOLE chat history was full of disgusting cheesy couple stuff. Both the persona and my dad were texting things like \"I love you so much, mwa mwa (kissing sounds), I'll give u a bug kiss, i love u so much my wifey\" \"i love you too my baby, get enough sleep, use face wash before u sleep\" \"💋💋\"\n\n  \nI knew she was a workmate for dad because they sometimes mentioned work stuff and how she hated person ranked above her (probably because hes nosy, office stuff always). \n\n\n\nBoth of them wrote messages in romaji (japanese written in english) and myanglish (burmese written in english), which r languages that a normal person in my country wouldn't understand. I think they had their guards on, just in case someone sees the chat but leaves them because they cant understand it. But i do. I dont understand romaji but i understand the myanglish.\n\n\n\nI dont know what to do right now. Im thinking of leaving it like that and maybe keep an eye on whoever that \"someone\" is. I dont wanna tell my mom, she would go insane. Shes the type who would get so mad if js a minor thing was gone wrong due to all the pressure shes holding. Shes the one who provides everything for the whole family. The 3 sisters' case havent also ended yet, my mom is hopeless for them too. Telling my mom isnt an option right now.\n\n  \nMy mom is 10 yrs older than my dad, shes also going through menopause so shes feeling the intense side effects as well.\n\n\n\nIm feel lost, but kinda feel relieved that i didnt put much affection and trust to my dad since 2 yrs ago which means  i wouldnt feel so attached even if he left. My whole family probably has a curse for relationships. Pls whoever is out there, advice me pls, i dont know what to do. I have read other ppl's reddit advices but all of them had telling their mums. I dont have the balls for that. Maybe should i just move on? I'll have to bear some guilt when its the time tho. Im pretty sure my family doesnt know about this. Maybe my dad's colleagues do. \n\n\n\nAnyway please do advice me as a child.",

Anyway the other women constantly brings me drama, my husband is committed to continuing with her while refusing to separate from me...I know it makes no sense i didn't leave years ago but I didn't, made excuses and honestly just trying to survive having 3 young kids close in age, cheater husband works ft also a law student so he's rarely around.

Also there are days at a time my husband becomes so attentive and involved with us it distracts me then he leaves for a day or two. \n\nUltimately I am working towards having the funds, & confidence to file for divorce and demand he move out. In the meantime I'm so fucking bored! I work when I can during the day, take care of kids outside of that and literally end the night watching tv alone. We've been married since right after college so I've never dated at this age and I just desire having someone interested in me, funny, kind, honest & distracting enough so I can prioritize ending this bad marriage.\n\nNot exactly looking for advice just venting here since I'm sure my best friend is as tired of this as I am.\n",

      "selftext": "I (27F) and moved out of my family home a year ago. About a week ago, after work, I came home to find my mom (54F) at my condo. She asked me not to tell my dad (55M) she was there. She said she was angry because she found what she called “sweet” messages between my dad and one of his coworkers. On top of that, she saw messages and call logs of him trying to contact shady massage parlors and “therapists.” Before that, she told me she had a gut feeling he was cheating again and that he had been mean to her and secretive with his phone.\n\nI was shocked, and I broke down and felt this deep pain for her, for my siblings, and for myself. I was furious at my dad. The last time I knew he cheated was around 20 years ago. He had a younger mistress he would visit during his trips abroad. It was a horrible time. I would wake up to violent fights between my parents, with yelling, things being thrown, and sometimes even getting physical. There was one point when we ran away from home and stayed with my mom’s friends and grandparents, but my dad eventually found us and it turned into a car chase. At one point, I went with my dad when he tried to take me and my siblings, even though I didn’t want to, because little me thought maybe it would stop the fighting. It didn’t, and my mom resented me for it for a while. She would sometimes make me talk to my dad to “fix” things between them, which obviously didn’t work. That whole chapter scarred me. It’s part of why I’m still wary of “shady” men today.\n\nThe whole week, my mom has been confiding in me about what she found and the conversations she’s had with my dad about it. I feel terrible saying this, but as much as I feel for her, I’m starting to lose patience with her choices and how she keeps disregarding what me and my siblings feel. I begged her to stay with me for a while, but she refused because she doesn’t want to leave my dad, not just the house but him entirely. She said she doesn’t want us to lose respect for him. I get that she’s trying to protect him, but I can’t look at him the same way anymore. Cheating in all forms is disgusting to me.\n\nIt doesn’t help that a few months ago, I found out my ex had been hiding an “online friend” while pretending to be a loyal, loving boyfriend. That discovery reopened all the pain I’ve buried from my childhood. Over the years, my mom has told me stories about how much abuse she’s endured from my dad and how he’s cheated even before they got married, yet she kept taking him back. When I was a teenager, she once found pictures of escorts on his phone and even showed them to me. She always says she loves him too much and doesn’t want a broken family. Last weekend, I tried to talk to her seriously about why she keeps tolerating this. I told her I can’t keep watching her lose herself like this, but she ignored me. She just scrolled through her phone and watched TV while I was trying to talk. I silently snapped from exhaustion and frustration and walked out. She didn’t even react. \n\nEven now, she keeps asking me, mostly me and not my siblings, to talk to my dad and help “fix” things between them. I’ve been avoiding him completely. He has no idea that I know what’s going on, but I’m so angry and disgusted that I’m scared I’ll lash out if I see him. It hurts that after all these years of trying to rebuild some kind of peace with him, it’s all ruined again because of his stupid need for attention and validation. Divorce isn’t legal where I’m from as well.\n\nMy mom says he blames all his cheating on her, which doesn’t surprise me. He has been gaslighting and deflecting for as long as I can remember. I’m angry at her too, because she keeps pushing me to talk to him or meet up with him when I just can’t. I cry almost every day because it all feels too heavy. I know this isn’t my responsibility to carry, but it feels like I’m the one who sees everything, feels everything, and somehow ends up being tasked to fix it while my own pain keeps getting brushed aside.",

I'm incredibly hurt and disturbed but at no point have really had any hatred towards what she did to us, even though I should.

He started going to Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous and agreed to couples counseling. I took a week to have no contact with him, and was adamant that I was going to break up with him on Friday. Now I’m getting cold feet, and considering trying an open relationship first before deciding. Any and all advise welcome. ",

That shes hidden her hollow shell and lack of integrity from everyone except me. She’s so outwardly successful and it KILLS me that I’m the only one who knows her real character underneath her accomplishments. Im the one who was left shredded on the floor of her complicit, selfish, cowardly, actions. I know what shes compensating for. I want her to remember me. To know when she chases her public accolades, that I’m the shadow that haunts her thoughts. That she can run 100 miles and she can never outrun what shes done.\n\nI want to know if she’s truly so empty that she feels no remorse…or if she has done any inner work on herself and is apologetic…or if she still believes he was for her.  Does she think it was a horrible mistake and that she was scared, weak, and running or is she defiantly clinging to that time with him? Is there any self reflection? Or is she truly one of those “win at all costs” type of person? \nI cant stop the desire to know if she’s unrepentant villain or a significantly broken person. \nBecause for some reason…it does matter to me. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I truly thought we were good but I just found out about two instances of cheating this year. I am so embarrassed and frustrated. He knows I am stuck right now. He once again is lovebombing, apologizing, and promising he'll be better. I'm losing my mind. I always believe him but I just can't this time.\n\nThe problem is that I am a lover girl and very susceptible to the lovebombing and just really want to love and be loved. I don't know how to mentally and emotionally disconnect from him but I know I need to. I think I could be gone within about 6-8 months from now. I want and need to be planning my exit.\n\nAny tips or support resources greatly appreciated. Early 30s, together 8 years, married for 4.",

She claims to have forgotten what she said at the time, and i didn't want to walk her through it all just for the sake of a \"gotcha\" moment.  \n\nBottom line... she was embarrassed about how she felt, and admitted she crossed the line. She said that she realized a while ago that what she felt wasn't right, and I have an idea of when she realized it, as all of his \"memorials\" started getting tossed in the garbage (pics, old trophies, belongings of his that she kept after he died), a couple years ago. \n\nIt still bothers me, and she feeling bad about the whole thing as well. I do believe her, and all her relationships with other men (her job has her dealing with men from all trades daily) have been strictly professional (she doesn't even joke with them, like she does with me).  But I can't go any farther without making her relive what she said, and I'm not sure that would even help anyway, so no sense in it, in my mind. So that's the end of it as far I'm concerned. \n\nWe're still together, going to try to work through it. \n\nI may be a fool, i hope not though... time will tell. ",

      "selftext": "\nI (28M) just found out that my wife (26F) — we’re married legally on paperhas been cheating on me with someone I considered one of my closest friends. From past a month I can’t even process how to feel right now.\n\nWe’ve been together for 8 years, and I’ve always trusted her completely. We used to have deep conversations about cheating — about how a little flirting can feel harmless, but once you cross that line, there’s no coming back. I never thought those conversations would end up describing us. Not to mention i used to tell her I’m too smart to catch you. \n\nThe guy she cheated with — let’s call him Mike — is someone I helped when he first came to Canada as a refugee three years ago. I supported him, encouraged him, and introduced him to my circle. He became part of our group, and I truly thought he was my boy. About a month and a half ago, he and my wife (let’s call her Amy) went to a Lil Wayne concert together because they’re both big fans. The concert got canceled, but they still hung out. I didn’t think much of it at first because I trusted them both.\n\nThen I started noticing changes — she began smoking weed more often, always with him. One night, he came to my building to pick her up, and I saw him from my balcony. He didn’t even text me to say hi. They were together from 9 p.m. until 2 a.m. That was my first real suspicion. When I asked her later if they ever talked about me, she said no, which hit harder than I expected.\n\nLast night, while we were intimate, she said something completely out of character — something that made my stomach turn. I tried to ignore it, but I couldn’t sleep. I had this overwhelming gut feeling that something was wrong. I’ve never looked through her phone in 8 years, but I did. My hands were shaking. I checked her messages — nothing. Then I opened her call log — Mike was the most recent missed call. I opened WhatsApp and searched random words like “love,” “come over,” “miss you.” That’s when I found a deleted thread with him. There was a photo of her birth control pills with the caption “breakfast of champions.” Then another message where she said something like “if you want to smell me, smell that condom on the floor.” That line just broke me completely.\n\nThe worst part is, she got her period today. She’s usually emotional on day one, and her birthday is coming up on Oct 22. Thanksgiving is right before that. I even ordered her a designer bag that arrived today — it’s still sitting in the box.\n\nI haven’t confronted her yet. My friends all say to walk away immediately, that there’s no coming back from this. But my heart still wants to hear her out. My mom and sister adore her — my single mom especially — and it’s going to destroy them when they find out. I feel like my whole world just collapsed overnight.\n\nI don’t even know where to start or how to confront her. There’s so much at stake — my family, our marriage, everything we built. My heart wants to give her a second chance, but we all know what happens when you give a second chance to a cheater. What should I do now?",

      "title": "My Story: D-Day: 2.5yrs ago, D-Day 2: Yesterday",
      "selftext": "I feel like it's finally time for me to tell my story. And what better time then after 2 hours of sleep last night.\n\nI have been in a LTR with a woman for 20 years. It's been long-distance for all of that time, but despite that we were each other's #1s, emotional support, shoulders to cry on, everything. We said good morning first thing and goodnight last thing. We problem-solved and celebrated successes, and spent countless hours together. And there was an intimate side to things as well, for the entire time. Was it perfect? No. Relationships never are. It was messy, but it was us. \n\nSomething changed - I'm not sure if it was Long Covid causing personality change (although that's giving her an out which I shouldn't), but I tried to be supportive as she dealt with health problems and was tired all the time. I stopped initiating intimacy and just focused on being a good friend and partner, caring for her as best I could. And then 2.5 years ago she came to me drunk and crying one night and confessed that some guy she had been sleeping with for like 5-6 weeks, and wanted a relationship with, had dumped her to go back to his ex. \n\nNow we had always had an understanding that if one or the other of us wanted to test the waters around us we would be open and transparent about it AHEAD OF TIME. In fact, I'd done that one time, went on a couple dates and slept with a woman a couple times back...13 years ago now? But I told her it was going on ahead of time. Her rationale for not being open and transparent was that \"it just happened - before I knew what was going on he had my skirt up around my waist\" and that she \"didn't know what she was feeling and didn't want to hurt my feelings till she figured it out.\" My pointing out that she could have done that literally anytime between him starting to suck on her neck and the 5th time she slept with him was blown off. Not to mention that from her recounting of it there were clear signs he was interested in more than just a friendship before she went over to his house. \n\nThis broke my heart. Shattered me. I've always said that cheating is a red line for me. Despite that though, either because of fear or co-dependence or sunk-cost fallacy, or empathy, I did not leave. Our relationship suffered - the intimacy came and went in flashes over the past two years. I'd put on a mask and try to be affectionate, but we all know that that mask can slip when we get triggered by the littlest thing. There was a real struggle to reforge an emotional connection on my end. I don't trust people easily with my heart, and once my trust is broken, my heart is gone. I never really felt that she was remorseful, the closest I got was the sort of \"I'm sorry for breaking your heart. Can't you just get over it. I got over it when you went on 5 dates with that other girl\" sort of apology that I imagine we've all heard. And even getting that was like pulling teeth and I was then told that she didn't want to have to keep apologizing so I should basically get over it and not bring it up again. Yet another warning sign that I should have heeded. \n\nI kept trying as best as I could. Looking back in hindsight I can see signs ahead of this next part that are now crystal clear, me trying to promote intimacy and her pulling away. Talk of shopping for lingerie. Fast forward to late August of this year. She disappeared - literally ghosted me without warning one Thursday or Friday night (I forget which). I figured at this point that she had met someone, so I grieved a bit and tried to move on - fairly successfully according to friends. Sent her an email saying that I hoped she wasn't dead and that she was just happy and having fun after about a week of not hearing from her. Now fast forward to Monday night. I get an email, the day after my birthday saying: \"I met a guy online in May\" (which means she'd been looking for at least a little while before that, so she'd given up and was just stringing me along as a backup). \"We slept together for the first time in August and that's why I disappeared. It felt like emotionally cheating on him to be talking to you.\" EMOTIONALLY CHEATING ON A GUY YOU MET TWO MONTHS AGO AND SLEPT WITH ONCE TO BE TALKING TO SOMEONE YOU HAVE 20 YEARS OF HISTORY WITH!!! And then a lot of additional details I'll spare for post length. The additional details at least cemented for me that she's radically changed her personality, that we've grown significantly apart in who we both are and what we're looking for. The woman I fell for and cared so much about isn't in there anymore. She'd never end things with a bunch of attempted digs about how happy she is now and how she's found what she's been missing all these years, how \"home isn't a place, it's him\", and then \"happy birthday\" and no actual caring sign off. \n\nI thought I'd already grieved and cried all my tears 2.5 years ago, or certainly over the last couple years when things were bumpy. So why couldn't I sleep last night? I wasn't even crying - wasn't even rereading the email in my head or anything. My mind was just...blank, but I couldn't sleep. Every so often a fragment of a thought would hit it and I'd either get angry or sad. But then I'd go back to blank, I just couldn't sleep. Bless my friend who dropped everything and came over to literally sit at my bedside and make sure I was alright all night.\n\nLessons learned - I should have been true to myself and kept to my red line 2.5 years ago. I would have spared myself the time over the last couple years, the memories that weren't \"good memories,\" and the additional hurt I'm feeling today. People who cheat are self-centered, lack empathy, and will do it again if they're not genuinely remorseful.\n\n\n\n",

My lifelong best friend casually dropped that she saw pics of his baby. I wasn’t processing what she was saying and then I said wait… let me call you back. \n\nI called my husband and said why is my best friend saying your sister posted a pic of your baby. For context his family has never liked me. And for the last several years I have wanted a baby, or wanted to adopt. He always firmly said no, which never made sense to me. It hurt. We have 2 beautiful children, 14 and 16. I had to keep repeating the question before he finally answered. Yes he cheated and got her pregnant. He thought he loved her (because of course you did, idiot). I asked are you sure it’s yours, no paternity test 🙄 he “just knows”. \n\nThe rage I felt was blinding. I suddenly understood how people snap and do terrible things. In my mind all I saw was ending him. So I took a deep breath, had my best friend come get my firearms, and went no contact for a few days. Then the embarrassment set in.\n\nHow do I tell our children ? How do I live? I have nothing. He took everything from me. We have been together 20 years! Married for 18. I can no longer have children as of January of this year. How can I be happy? I gave up my career to support his. How do I leave?\n\nI don’t know where to start. I’m devastated. I was happy with him. I liked my life. I told him I hope he dies. I meant it. Still do. I want him to hurt the way he hurt me. I know it’s not right, not realistic. He says he wants his family (LOL!). He claims everyone has ghosted him (double LOL!), including his family and friends. He says he’s ashamed and I said good. \n\nI don’t want to work it out. I don’t want to stay. I am numb. I just want to get AWAY! And of course he said the usual: it’s on him, I was a great wife, etc. etc. While confirming he thought he loved her lol… \n\nI just kept asking: WHY DIDN’T YOU LET ME GO!!??!",

I wasn’t even allowed to know his passcode for emergency purposes. Finally the other day it all came to a head, he gave me the code to his phone (after giving himself ample time to erase anything incriminating). Unfortunately for him, he forgot to clear out the recently deleted videos & images. What I found there was so disgusting I can’t even put it into words. I finally got good & mad (which I don’t generally do) and confronted him. He’s started therapy.\n\nDivorce isn’t an option for me. We have three children and I know that some kids do come through divorce ok, but I can’t stomach the thought of putting them through that, especially since up until now we have had a (seemingly to myself & everyone around us) great marriage. It would come as such a shock to them. And he is a great dad, as terrible a husband as he’s been.\n\nSo all that to ask- how do you survive coexisting with a person that has hurt you so deeply? My body hasn’t caught up to my head and my heart and lying next to him every night without being held is pure torture. Keeping up appearances in front of everyone in our lives- exhausting.

She’s in the same group of friends and when my fiancé went to PH for 2weeks last June, he told me they hadn’t seen each other, but I found a picture from one of their hangouts and recognized her. Some people even used a dummy account to message me about it and my fiancé denied it telling me that people are just jealous and want to ruin our relationship. \nI asked his friends and even his closest cousin about it at that time and they all denied it too. Eventually, I snooped through his phone when he came back here in US (I know it’s wrong) and found proof that they did hang out. Multiple times with the same group of friends and that one cousin I reached out to. When I confronted them after finding out the truth, they all made me feel like I’m the toxic one for asking them constantly.\nBefore that, he also told me he felt “confused” about his other ex, the one who cheated on him and explained it as trauma. But I told him that if it was really trauma, he wouldn’t still feel confused about his feelings for her.\nThen, months later, I found out he’d been stalking that same ex for the entire year we’ve been together. I saw it in his TikTok watch and search history, using a dump account I’m not aware of. He apologized and said he stopped, but honestly, I don’t even know what to believe anymore.\nDespite everything, I stayed. I hate that I did, but I did. He’s been trying hard to win me back by being sweet, showing effort, reassuring me that he loves me. But every time he says “I love you,” I remember how he said those same words last year while secretly stalking his ex and lying to my face about the other one.\nI told him I don’t even know what was real in our relationship anymore. I feel stuck between wanting to believe him and knowing he already broke my trust in the worst way. I hate myself and I feel stupid. ",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI (34M) discovered my girlfriend (32F) of 5 years has been flirting with several other men in her Facebook messages. It was all good and fair, she asked to go through my phone and so I asked to go through hers in exchange. She found nothing in mine but I found messages to 3 other men (she was texting them while I was with her at her house! There were 3 message threads above me in the list (and my last messages to her were arranging me coming over) and when I saw her sending “🥰” emojis to other guys along with long and flowing conversations with intimate details—after telling me she loves me and shit?! \n\nI lost it. I’ve left, I’m staying with my parents, but at the same time it’s all I can think about. \n\nLet me also share that I caught her doing the same thing back in 2023, but profuse apologies and relinquishing certain rights to privacy (allowing me to go through her phone at any time; track her location; etc.) caused for me to forgive it and things have seemed alright ever since.\n\nThat is, until in 2024, I was able to trick her into confessing about actual, physical infidelity. I asked “when was the last time you slept with someone other than <my name>?” And without thinking, she answered June of 2022. Which we were an official couple at the time (although, I admit that I wasn’t attached at all and really didn’t care for the relationship at that time) and so, I told myself that I wasn’t in love with her at the time and neglected things, so I can understand and forgive considering my disposition at the time. So long as it never happened again.\n\nAnd now, I find messages to at least 3 other men. And then all these red flags start popping up—like when she had a “dental appointment” (no procedure; just initial inspection and schedule for work at a later date) and she was gone from 7:30am (she had to drop her daughter from previous relationship off at school at 8) and didn’t get back until after 1pm.\n\nShe ALWAYS was accusing me of cheating when I NEVER cheated. And from what I’m now learning, this is pretty common for serial cheaters to do—project their guilt onto you.\n\nI’m so mad. I feel like such an idiot. But then, stupidly, I’m depressed about it and wanna hear from her. But she’s terrible! She’s the last thing I want out of a partner. And yet, cuz I’m 34 and single with no friends (at all), the loneliness makes you feel like you’d rather deal with the bullshit.\n\nI can’t get this shit out of my mind and it’s interfering with my responsibilities and shit. \n\nPlease, if you have any advice on how to stay grounded and not go back to the abuse, I could really use it.\n\nThanks for reading.",

      "selftext": "Hi Everyone. \n\nI've been lurking on this and other similar boards for awhile and this is my first time posting about this. I first discovered my now husband was lying/cheating right before we got married. Wedding was planned and paid for. I tried to leave, but I felt a lot of pressure to go forward with the wedding and he was making all the right promises. It's been a bumpy road for 14 years. I've never been truly happy, and while I've never directly caught him again, there's been lies, a lack of transparency, and failed attempts at marriage counseling. I've been waiting for the kids to get older, because they're really the only thing I care about, and I don't want to share them. Part of me feels like he's the one lying/hiding, why not just let him carry the bulk of the bills (I do work, but he makes more), and then when the kids are older, and I'm able to make more money, I can move on. Most of the time, we get along like good friends. There are days when the loneliness and lies are deeply painful, though. \n\nI'd be very interested in hearing stories from people that had enough information to know that their partner wasn't being honest/faithful, but you stuck it out for reasons other than being in love or even happy with them. I'm also considering hiring a PI to get more information so I can at least make decisions with as much truth as possible. TIA",

It's been ten years but still hard and I was thinking of that almost every day... \n\nBut then I met someone who was in the same situation I am, opposite gender, but exact same situation.  She was feeling exactly what I felt, we had the same obsession for the intercourse details of our significant other, we were insanely connected and had a full week of  intense and very deep discussion. By the way I think you'll recognize yourself and I can not thank you any more for this. Feel free to reach me again whenever your need!\n\nSo, the fact is talking so freely with some random stranger was so delivering. Because I didn't felt judged, because there wasn't a face looking at me. I was able to let everything out, and finally had the courage to talk with my wife and face the issue. \n\nI know it seems pretty dumb and everyone will be like \"Wow, OP just discovered therapy...\" but anyway, I just want to remind you that sometimes the solution is that easy and communication is always the way. \n\nI'm proud to move on. I wish the same to all of you. And thanks again stranger, you have been more useful than you can even imagine.",

We have 3 young kids together.\n\nI had actually caught them being flirty in texts before, and when I confronted them, they both said it was just friendly conversation, but I knew it was inappropriate. Think not outright sexual talk, but emotional stuff, getting to know each other, and a lot of talking late at night in secret. Even his wife took his side after I called him out and she defended it as just how “friendly” he is. My wife apologized, he wrote me a letter asking for forgiveness. We’re a Christian family, and I chose to forgive them over time, though hesitantly.\n\nAbout 6 months later, I find them talking again. I confronted her a 2nd time, this time in a much angrier way due to the content being worse and with the same dude, and she lied like a cornered human usually does. I ultimately found out this time it was a full on physical affair, though I had to pry it out of her.\n\nObviously this devastated me, and I started the process of divorce. I told friends and family, I talked to an attorney, but ultimately I paused. I’m thinking of my kids mostly, and we actually had a great marriage until now, so I still loved her despite all of this. We never grew apart, and she says this wasn’t due to some dissatisfaction with me at all.\n\nWe’re in counseling now because she says she doesn’t love the guy, and she’s saying it never had anything to do with him and that she just enjoyed feeling desired after having 3 kids and seeing her body change. She says she loves me, wants to keep our family together, and will do what it takes. To her credit, she is at least owning it now and taking steps to be better.\n\nSo, I’m choosing to stay (for now). But I bounce between pissed off, incredibly sad, hopeless, happy and normal, etc. Any advice from those who’ve stayed on how you’ve gotten through the roller coaster of emotions without taking it out on those around you? My biggest worry is that I’ll stay, not ever be fully ok, and my kids get a worse version of me than they deserve.\n\nHelp a brother out!",

      "title": "Not sure if I should be concerned about husband's mentoring relationship",
      "selftext": "I'm 52 and have been with my husband (51) for 5 years. He is an HR director in the corporate world. Last year, he received a book and a thank you card from a female mentee of his (\"R\", she is around 30). The book was something about culture, can't remember. I remember being there when he opened the package and he said, \"Oh that was nice of her.\"  I think he may have mentioned she was a work colleague that he had been helping. It was the first I'd heard of her. I knew that he also had a couple of male mentees at the time that he regularly met with online. I noted it as a little odd that he'd never mentioned her before, but didn't dwell on it.\n\nSome time after that, I overheard his video call with R and they were discussing the book she had sent him and he had apparently sent her one, as well - a book called \"Sapiens\", also about sociology/culture. There was no flirting or anything, but I could tell that he liked talking to her and it seemed like he was trying to impress her. They weren't talking about work related stuff, just about these books, ideas, their thoughts. (This was the only conversation of theirs that I ever heard.) I asked him about it later and he said she was a mentee of his and that he'd sent her a used copy of that book because she had sent him a book and he thought it would be nice to send her one back. He joked that she was in a \"committed lesbian relationship\". I didn't bring it up again.\n\nThat was a year ago. 7 months ago he left the company they both worked for. So I figured they were no longer meeting. Then last week he mentioned that he had reached out to her to see if she'd be interested in a position he and his boss were hiring for. She had just received a promotion but otherwise would have been interested. He mentioned that they still meet monthly. This was a surprise to me.\n\nI lightheartedly mentioned how he would have thought it was weird if it had been me exchanging books with a male colleague. He said yeah, he would have been curious about it, but not suspicious. And he would have understood once I explained it. I made a joke about her being in a \"committed lesbian relationship\". He said actually, he realized her partner is a man. He had just assumed it was a woman by the way she referred to him as \"partner\". He said he mentioned something to her about her partner being a woman and she corrected him, but she wasn’t offended and thought it was funny. He said to me, “you have nothing to worry about. She’s a baby. She’s like 30 years old.”\n\nIt seems strange to me that he’s been meeting with this woman every month and hasn’t mentioned anything about it, that I found out about it only because she sent him a book. At this point I can only guess they've been having video chats once per month for at least a year and a half and he never talks about her. He has continued these meetings despite leaving the company and has not continued to meet with the other mentees he had there.\n\nHe’s extremely busy and practically has to schedule his time to the minute. So it’s concerning to me that he has continued to make time for her. And it is also weird to me that I have never heard him meeting with her on his work from home days. Since she is not part of the current company he works for, he would not meet with her during his work hours. So I have no idea when these video chats are taking place. Maybe on his lunch break? (She lives in another state, so they've never met in person).\n\nWhen we spoke about it the other day he seemed totally relaxed. Not defensive at all, not nervous. And yet this is the first I’ve heard of her in a year. So I am struggling to determine if this is something I should even be concerned about. I don't work in the corporate world, so all I know about this type of mentorship is what I've read online. And from what I've read, it would be unusual for him to carry forward only this one female mentee after leaving the company. And the fact that he doesn't speak of her to me, when he does talk to me about other work colleagues, is also very concerning.\n\nI have betrayal trauma from my previous marriage, so it can be hard for me to know what's my intuition and what is simply anxiety being triggered from past experiences. I would be grateful for some reality testing and outside perspective here. Thanks for reading.",

Very graphic details of their sex life and him taking her shopping, the other woman knows who I am. After being confronted, my husband has yet to give her name or any details of how long this has been going on.  All is says, if that he is sorry, will not do it again and wants this marriage to work.  He has offered to do everything, from sharing his location with me or going to marriage therapy.  What good if me knowing his location, if I don't know who the woman is? he could be with her wherever he is and I just know where he is, but not who he is with. He wont even give me access to his phone. He claims that none of that matter is we want it work, we should move on and work on us...  I am broken, this woman knows who I am, so obviously, she is around me. A have no clarity and believe he will not stop. he's protecting her, but won't protect me.",

We are actually officially getting divorced this week. \n\nI’ve been living with my parents since, doing therapy, attending a divorce support group, journaling, walking my dog, and even spent a night back at my condo this week to start reclaiming my space. \n\nI think I’m doing a little better since the beginning, but still, I feel completely lost. The grief and loneliness are overwhelming, and I keep thinking I should be doing better by now. Some days I feel a bit of stability, and others I break down crying. I can’t stop missing her, even though I know the relationship is over. I just feel hopeless and afraid that I’ll never really recover from this.\n\nFor those of you who’ve been through infidelity and divorce, how long did it take before the pain started to lift or you began to feel whole again? What helped the most in months 3–6? I’d really appreciate hearing your experiences \n\nI need some perspective and hope right now.\n",

He fell in love with a coworker and the affair lasted 8 months. He was planning to tell me over the summer, but I saw text messages one night and caught him. The messed up thing is that yes, we were in a bit of a rough patch in our marriage (me feeling depressed about perimenopause symptoms, low sex drive, etc; him having a midlife crisis), but our relationship has always been super strong. We have always had such love, care, respect, and friendship. That's why this betrayal is so shocking. Even our couples therapist told me how it doesn't make sense to her. We are in therapy and working on reconciling, but he still has really strong feelings for the AP. There is no contact between them and he says he wants to focus on us and our family, but he is still grieving the loss of this love. I don't want to give up on everything we have, but the pain of this is unbearable. I've read all about limerance, etc, but it feels like he is still romanticizing the affair partner. Will these feelings ever fade?",

      "selftext": "SORRY I WROTE SO MUCH. Explained the situation, story, break up. If you have the time to read and respond, thank you in advance, I really appreciate it!!\n—\n\nMy ex of 1 year, and 3 months dating prior, long distance in the UK, roughly 400 miles.\nHe cheated on me while extremely drunk and high, puked and then eventually was kissing another girl.\n\nFor a day and a half after the night he went out, he seemed distant and avoidant, we eventually FaceTimed and spoke, he admitted what he’d done. \nWe spoke more, as I cried, heart broken and then \nI ended the relationship.\n\nBecause sadly this was the second time he had gotten extremeeeely drunk and cheated on me. \nIt seems he can’t control himself when extremely drunk, is impulsive and seems to love& need attention from other women, validation & an ego boost. (He defo has low self esteem and fear of abandonment)\n\nAfter I ended it, he accepted that and we were in contact for about 3 weeks after, mostly arguing, me crying or both being kind to each other and explaining our understanding of the break up. \nI asked for him to grow and get help for himself so we could fix things and have the life we both wanted, grow old together and feel the love and joy we felt.\n\nBut sadly, He pushed down his emotions and all feelings for me, not long after the break up, basically started to erased me from his life, was “getting on with life” and doing things to “fill the void” by gaming and speaking to new people.\n\nEventually,\n4 weeks post break up, He met a couple of people while gaming online and was playing with them consistently and streaming, so I asked about them and the girl, he said he was trying to fill the void and that he hadn’t replaced me. Was just getting on with his life..\n\nThen a month later (2 month post break up mark) \nhe text me saying -\n“This is a tough message and I’m sorry to do this to you, I can’t think of anything else. I’ve been talking to someone new for about a month. it’s slowly getting serious. I hope you don’t hate me. But find some solid closure. Knowing I was a piece of shit and now you can let me go”\nand that - \n“I want you to be happy, please let me go”\n\nI said some stuff and he then claimed he doesn’t need therapy, it’s not childhood trauma, and his coping mechanisms are normal and how he always copes.\n\nClaimed that he’s learned from the cheating and won’t be doing it again 🙄 lol..\nSo I get cheated on twice and now the next person gets the respect I should have gotten?\n\nIn the relationship, He claimed to love me more than he’s ever loved anyone, feels a pull towards me, that our love wasn’t ordinary. I’m the kindest person and most perfect person he’s ever met,\nSo many other extremely loving and kind things.\n\nHe continued to say this about me after we broke up, that I didn’t do anything wrong, that I am the kindest person he’s ever met, that everything was real, that he did feel how he said that he did in the relationship, that he did truly love me etc.\n\nHe pushed down his emotions and all romantic feelings for me after the break up, basically started to erased me from his life, found someone else to fill the void, then I get that text a month later.\nClaimed he sent it to “try and do right by you for once” \n\nI’m heart broken. I guess I also feel jealous, I’m hurt that he moved on so quickly, even if it’s a rebound or not, even if it lasts with her or not.\n\nI miss him, I love him, but I don’t want the unhealed person he is, back. I want him back but I want him to heal and get help for himself.\nWhich likely will never happen.\n\nI’m trying my best, to accept everything, the currently reality, I’m trying to move on.\nBut I miss him. He’s got me blocked since his text about speaking to someone else.\n\nIt’s been 3 months since we broke up, 2 months of him speaking to her.\n\nI’m really heart broken.\nWe were literally applying for homes weeks and literally days before he cheated.\n\nHe chose to accept and move on because he claims he didn’t want to hurt me again, that I deserve better than how he’s treated me.\n\nBut I still miss him. I’m hurt that he moved on so quickly, I feel so disregarded? I feel so unloved, I feel like our relationship was all lies and never real.\nLike he never loved me.\n\nMy depression has gotten worse since the break up, I’m suffering with Anhedonia (loss of joy/pleasure in hobbies & usual activities) \nI’m struggling to heal because I can’t imagine my own future anymore.. because I don’t even enjoy my hobbies or anything right now, I’m obviously really struggling to even find or figure out what I’d like to do with my life and future..\n\nI feel lost, I’m grieving, I’m extremely sad/depressed, don’t enjoy anything and unsure about my life/my own future.\n\nI miss him. I truly believed we were going to grow old together, that we both truly wanted that, that he truly loved me, that we were eachothers person.\n\nI accept he has a lot of healing that he needs to do, but that likely isn’t going to happen because he’s just jumped to the next person.\n\nI accept that I need to heal from all of this, and I’m trying my best to, while I’m also waiting for mental health help and therapy.\n\nI just, I’m struggling so much, I guess I feel jealous too, I keep having horrid thoughts of him being so happy with her, them kissing, sleeping together, being romantic together, them having laughs, spending enjoyable time with each other. Feeling joy together that him and I felt together.\n\nIt hurts. I’m lost. Feels unfair that I have to grieve while he can just jump to the next person and not grieve, but instead gets to be happy, gets connection, attention, love and validation from someone else.\nHe gets to be happy.\n\nI wish him well, I’m trying not to hold anger or resent him, but I also hurt and feel all alone even though I’m not alone \n\nIdk.\nThings are such a mess for me right now and it sucks.\nSorry this is so long, but thank you if you read and respond😓\n",

      "selftext": "My husband’s betrayal has destroyed me — do I leave or try to fix this? (Need advice)\n\nHi everyone, I really need some advice because I feel completely lost. Apologies in advance for the long post. \n\nI (28F) have been with my husband (30M) since 2021. We got married in 2024 and have been friends since childhood.\n\nA few months ago, I found out he’d been messaging other women throughout our relationship. Two stood out:\n\nWoman A: Messages were on Snapchat, so I only saw what was saved. He had saved explicit videos and pictures from her, and their messages were always in the early hours of the morning — the same time he was watching p*rn. She even said things like “I didn’t know you had a girlfriend, I wish you weren’t with someone,” and they had expressed feelings for eachother and kept talking up until when I found out. When I confronted him, he said it was “just catching up.”\n\nWoman B: He’s known her a while and would message her saying he wanted to meet up and was desperate for s*x bevause I didn’t ’put out enough’. \n\nI also discovered s*xual messages between him and my best friend, who he works with. He claimed it was “just a joke.”\n\nWhen I confronted him, he deleted messages, including one begging Woman A to call him after I found out (I assume to cover himself). He even went as far as creating a fake call log with AI to lie about it. He lied about the call log being fake right up until I found the edited image on his AI app.\n\nI moved in with my parents for a while, then came back home after endless promises and begging. Months later, I’m still broken. I don’t trust him. I panic when he’s on his phone, and I barely sleep because he used to message them while I was asleep.\n\nI’ve lost my confidence, my peace, and my self-worth. I feel anxious all the time. I’m too scared to begin IVF treatment with someone I don’t trust. \n\nPart of me knows I need to leave, but I’m scared. I’ll be a divorced 28-year-old who needs IVF to have children. I’m afraid of leaving my home, starting over, and being alone.\n\nIf anyone’s been through something similar — a betrayal or divorce in your 20s — how did you move forward? How do you stop being paralysed by fear?\n\nThank you for reading. I just really need some guidance. 💔",

Looking for some book reccomendations to help me find clarity on whether to reconcile or accept it's over (I am on a wait list for individual therapy). \nI'm reading the betrayal bind- but I couldn't relate to any of the chump lady's book. Details of my situation below.\nThank you so much in advance. \n\nThe sad story. \nMy Husband (31) and I (31) have been together for 15 years, married 8.\nI discovered 2 months ago that whilst away on work trips periodically over the last 5 years (usually a few weeks every autumn), he has been unfaithful. Two one night stands, multiple targeting of women in bars, and downloading of Tinder on 3 occasions.\nI was absolutely blindsided. The correlating factor in these events are excessive alcohol and certain crowds of people as it hasn't happened every time. \n\nSince discovery he has taken accountability with our family, told work that he can't travel anymore and thus risking his job security, put himself in therapy, is reading everything he can, taken my anger, tried to reassure me, and hasn't done anything to blame our relationship... In fact he consistently reiterates he's the one who is fucked up and broken and he's so angry at himself. I've never seen him so devastated. \n\nMeanwhile, I am trying my best to look after myself. Self care, booking in visits to friends, coming up with plan b for work (we were about to start trying for a baby and I had mentally checked out of career goals), trying to find little pieces of joy amongst the shit show. \n\nBut it's all devastating and exhausting. I feel completely broken and just paralysed. Everyone keeps asking me what I'm going to do. I just don't know. It's the honest answer. The biggest issue is that we have been through so many formative parts of our lives together, loss of a parent, illness, career growth... And throughout that he was my rock and I love him. He scooped me up off the floor time and time again. He loved me when I couldn't love myself, and now he's trying to love me when I don't know if I can love him back. \nBut he's also hurt me deeper than I ever thought possible. I do not deserve this and I never want to feel like this again. \n\n",

Dday was June 2024 right after I had started nursing school and he had an affair with my friend for almost a year. I had a mental breakdown and almost dropped out. When I found out he cut off contact and has not spoken to her since. He promised he would change the way he treated me and all the things. The affair started after he hit me in the face while I was driving down the highway with our kids in the car because I was ignoring him yelling at me. He left and stayed gone for a week and that’s when he started the affair and never stopped. Fast forward to now, he is back to being verbally and emotionally abusive as well as threatening me. But this time feels different. I don’t feel sad anymore. I just feel done. But every time I get one foot out the door he starts acting normal again and it pulls me back in. My trauma bond with this man is severe as I’ve been with him for 13 years, since I was just 16 years old. I will be graduating nursing school December of this year and I will be going from making $3500 to $5000 after taxes monthly and we live in VA. My question is, do you guys think I could make it on my own? Should I wait until December or just go now? How to I fight the trauma bond to stay strong in my decision? Thank you 💕",

He's full of remorse and has fully owned up to it, and going to therapy for himself and on an odd chance I could forgive him he swears he's commited to a change.\n\nEven infidelity aside though, things haven't been perfect between us interpersonally, with frequently getting annoyed at each other over small things and slowly growing apart in interests and values.\n\nWe have a very deep bond and have been through some incredibly difficult things together and we're best friends, he's somebody I could rely on at any point and vice versa and there has never been any emotional cheating and I'm sure of his love for me.\n\nMy dilemma though is with how many people on this sub and in general suffer for years with the mood ups and downs and by the sounds of it make themselves and their partners miserable in the process. Many stories I read, I just don't get what's been gained from reconciliation?\n\nIf you have reconciled, has it been mostly good or mostly bad?\n\nTLDR; has reconciliation been worthwhile for you?",

      "selftext": "So D day for my WW(F41) and I (M43) was around 12 years ago.  The affair was short, she admitted to it immediately and the first things I said was \"I still love you, it's going to be ok. Go taka shower.\" Afterwards I asked a few questions, we set some boundaries and moved on with life. \n\nI imploded. My self esteem went so unbelievably low. She asked me not to tell her AP's wife about the affair as they had two kids under 5, I agreed and said if it would help us move past this then I wouldnt tell. (spoiler alert - his next AP outed him and they got divorced). \n\nI didn't tell anyone about the affair and I didn't tell her how it made me feel. I boxed it all up and ate it like a shit sandwich that wouldn't stay down and had to be re-eaten every once in a while.\n\nI continued to measure myself against this mystery man every time I was sexually rejected, Everytime I was emotionally dismissed, Everytime I felt unattractive, unwanted, or unworthy of love. A couple months ago, I had a bit of a breakdown (see my prior post). \n\nAnd we started therapy. I can't decide if that was the right thing. We have been arguing so much more now. My wife says she is glad I told her everything (I absolutely dumped a truck load of my feelings out). BUT, her reactions and guilt lead to self hate and now I'm trying to help her past her reactionary pain. She feels blindsided as we hadn't discussed the affair in over a decade, she says she never thinks of it and barely remembers details. I dropped all this pain on her and she feels that she isn't worthy of my love and doesn't deserve the life we've built. \n\nI've tried to protect her from what I've felt these years because I don't like to see her hurt. If she's hurt, I'm hurt and I can't let this run down a spiral. I'm trying to protect her from some of our therapists questions as I don't think they are constructive. I don't want to dissect every pain point, I just wanted to be heard, my pain to be acknowledged, and to be understood that I need some help letting go of it. \n\nInstead, I'm afraid my wife's self-hate will drive a wedge in our marriage and I'll lose everything I've been trying to save this whole time. \n\nIt's a tough spot to be in. Who will comfort me while I have to comfort the only person that knows of my pain and was the source of it? The crazy part is I forgave her a long time ago, but as I've had to keep explaining to her, forgiveness isn't the same as forgetting and the scars have an acute memory.\n\nI don't really know what I'm looking for here, maybe a safe space that my therapist can't seem to provide? Maybe advice on how to explain this to my wife?  - I'm going to shut down the \"divorce her and move on\" comments, I truly love this woman and I will continue to love her until I am unable to draw breath. \n\nEdit - copied from a comment for clarity.\n\n\nI don't want you to misunderstand my post - I'm not angry. Im not confused about her. My eyes are open on who my wife is and all of her flaws. Regardless of those flaws I love her.  I'm just looking for some compassion and a little support. ",

      "selftext": "This is a long post so please bare with me as I try to type out my story. \nBack in 2018 I got married to my husband. My high school best friend was my maid of honor. She didn’t live near us so she would stay for the weekend when needed. The first weekend is the weekend she met my husband. Now I had just started my job and I didn’t have time off. So my husband stayed home with her. I don’t think anything weird happened the very first daytime. Now, that evening we (my husband and I) drank she couldn’t because of a legal thing. (Looking back we shouldn’t have drank but we were young and dumb) well I was pretty gone. I remember bits and pieces but not much. I know I was on the floor. My husband was also pretty gone. No one checked on me. My husband said she lead him to our son’s room (where she was staying he was with his grandparents for the night) and proceeded to sleep with him. Supposedly he said he asked about me and she had told him I was fine and that they should have fun. When I woke up I was on the floor and went looking for them and the door was locked. My husband then came to and told me nothing happened. (I recently found out this was a lie) \nNow there are 2 more times where they slept together. I don’t know when. They didn’t use protection. This was also like I said all fine within a months time. \nFast forward. My husband is saying he was forced. (The first time i believe is the only time he was taken advantage of) he said that she told him she would tell me. (And one of the things i told him i would leave him for is being unfaithful) and now he’s telling me he was forced to do it. And that he didn’t want to. He’d get soft or it took too long. And like I don’t want to not believe him. But some of the other details just don’t add up. But then I feel bad for thinking he could be making it up. He said he hated being alone with her but yet would constantly find excuses to be alone with her? \nSince finding this out I just feel dirty. I will say during the time of them being intimate I should have known. That was the one and only time I kept struggling with BV. I didn’t before and I haven’t since. But like I can’t seem to look at him the same. We have kids so I feel like we need to stay together but I know not to stay just for the kids. Idk am I wrong for not fully believing? Am I wrong for feeling dirty? Am I wrong for not wanting to be sexual with him? \n",

I have no proof of him actually meeting up with anyone but it was clear by messages that is what he was interested in. \n\nI stayed, we came to an agreement that cheating was talking with anyone else in a sexual manner/receiving pictures. I thought we were good, that we viewed things differently and now we were on the same page.\n\nI got pregnant, we got married, the following year I found out he was talking to other people again. I was heartbroken. I had found messages on his phone that were after the first time I caught him, and then again before our one year anniversary.  \n\nI stayed. I wanted to make it work for the kids, but I've stayed scared of him cheating again. I worry while I'm at work, at the worst of times I have looked through his phone. When I don't find anything I think \"ah, he has just gotten better at hiding shit from me.\" Then I give it sometime and come back to loving him and believing he won't do that again and wanting to make our marriage work. This has been the cycle for years.  \n\nToday I had a moment of wanting to cheat. It was clear that I could have. I don't fully understand it. Maybe I'm angry that I've been the only one working, maybe I'm angry that he has been finically irresponsible, maybe I'm angry that the house is a mess even though the kids are in school, or maybe I just want to hurt him the way he has hurt me. \n\nWe did therapy for bit together then solo. I don't know how to trust him again. I don't know why after 4ish years since the last time I caught him, that I would think like this. This is not me, I don't think about straying. I don't know what to do. I feel sick to my stomach but I did nothing wrong other than have the thought. I'm scared to leave, I'm scared of getting a divorce.\n\n I still love him, but I'm starting to get the ick. His breath bothers me when it never did before,  sometimes he just won't shut up about things that I have no interest in I used to love to hear him talk about anything, he actually annoys me now. These aren't things that I noticed today,  they have been slowly creeping up on me. I feel like the worst partner and I don't know what to do. ",

      "selftext": "Boyfriend of two years cheated on me, apparently home life was too much, he felt like a glorified maid who did “everything” and taken for granted. I get that, it was a stressful time, I was being made redundant and was stressed myself.\n\nHe obviously didn’t handle it as well so in a bid to feel like himself again he messaged a bunch of girls, anyone and everyone on his contact list looking for a quick dopamine fix. He messaged exes and were sexting them for weeks before I caught him, and kicked him out. There were no theatrics, no tears.\n\nBut I’m a fool, I know that. I’m not one to give up on someone so we began “dating” again, I wanted to forgive him but it’s been a rollercoaster, some days are better than others but the whole ordeal has changed how I feel about him, but I don’t know if that’s the depression and just what is to be expected and will get better over time. I want it to get better. \n\nWhat I didn’t account for was how stubborn he would be. I’m autistic and have always struggled with expectations. So when i said we can try and work through it my expectations were that he would grovel more, he would be the perfect boyfriend and essentially do everything he could to make me happy. But that just hasn’t been the case. It’s always “I know I cheated, but-“ “I know you’re suffering, but-“ “I know you’re angry, and have every right to be, but -“ and then he will gaslight me into why he is also suffering, why his feelings matter, why it’s my fault I’m the first place. We can’t have a single conversation about it without him making it about him and his problems completely dwarfing what this has meant for me. \n\nI can forgive him for cheating, I don’t agree with it, but from a psychological perspective I understand the reasoning. What I can’t forgive is the audacity afterwards. He went to therapy after but I don’t think he was there long enough and I’m slowly losing my will to fight for this relationship.

Our relationship was amazing, we had great communication, amazing chemistry, made a wonderful team, shared interests and hobbies, everything. This blindsided and destroyed me. \n\n  \nIt took me a year to get over the deep pain and grief of knowing we would never have the life we (or I?) had dreamed of. To stop missing him. To accept what I couldn't change. \n\nOne thing I'm struggling to cope with, however, is the deep anger it stirred in me. Even though we aren't together anymore, I find myself feeling so deeply mad at what happened. At him. At what he did. \n\n  \nI find myself replaying our relationship over and over and over. Wondering what was real and what wasn't. Feeling insecure about all the ways in which I was different to the girl I was cheated on with. Wondering if i was just a fool all along. \n\n  \nThis anger is consuming. This resentment towards him and myself has become a part of me. I overthink everything about us and our relationship. And even though we had several long talks where he explained everything, I still find myself feeling so angry, insecure and bitter. I still find myself analyzing everything that happened over and over.\n\nDoes anyone have any tips on how to overcome this? (ps. can't afford therapy, so that is unfortunately not an option)\n\nThanks.",

Last night she closed the bedroom door while i was in the living room and i wanted the be around her, watch some movies or just spend some time together so i checked on her and talked with her, she said she was just talking over discord with some friends i let her be and checked on her again about an hour later, this time it was in plain sight for me, she wasn't wearing underwear and her shorts where messy when i approached and sat in the bed she turned off her laptop camara and turned her phone screen down but i saw she was using a app for spicy role playing, i couldn't keep the fear out of my face and she asked me what's going on, i asked again what's wrong, why is she so different with me now and she kept saying that everything was okay. \n\ni turned around and headed to the living room, opened her discord account i found just what i feared and while i was taking pictures to give her a last chance she deleted the whole chat, in that moment i knew there was no turning around if whatever was written was so bad she deleted it i could not ever imagine what she did in all this calls with that person.  \n  \ni feel this got too long but for closure, i confronted her she denied everything and even framed me as being a bad person for looking into her privacy until i said what I've reed just before she deleted the chat, i ended up asking her to leave and paying the taxi on way to her mom's house.\n\ni can't stop feeling i could just trust her when she said she was just bored and wouldn't do it again, that she would never talk to him again i tried to trust her several times and each time she lied to me, until the last second. I would like to read what ever any of you have to say and i apologize for any gramal error, my english is out of shape.",

Then he married his AP.  She told me years ago when we were pushing our firstborn in a stroller, \"I'd never have an affair, look what happened to my dad and my family\".  Yea...\n\n**Mar 23'**\\- she admitted to \"having an emotional connection/thing with the babysitter.  I didn't think much of it b/c no signs of bi-sexual or lesbian....I just supposed she was confiding/dumping issues on the GF\n\n**Mar 23'**\\- I filed for divorce.  I never attempted reconciliation\n\n**May 23'**\\- I moved out (had no intention of keeping a large house).  GF moved in the same day...she was actually living there when I had to go away for work in Jan/Feb for a few weeks at a time.\n\n**Nov 23'**\\- Divorce Finalized\n\n**Jun 25'**\\- Called and asked something about the kids, then asked, \"how are you doing\", \"do you think you will get married again\", \"I made a huge mistake with (GF name), I don't know what I was thinking\" and said some other stuff admitting that she regrets her decision and giving up on the marriage.\n\n**Nov 23'- Oct 25'**\\- Coparenting was very easy, and so was the divorce process.  Fair, no complaints at all.  Ex-wife doesn't and never hated me, just said, \"I never feel like I truly loved and ever wanted you\" -quote from Nov 22'.  The last two years she's texted probably 20 out of 30 days a month, sometimes more.  It's all related to \"kid stuff\", but it's a bit much...schedule is set, so not sure why the texting, but it wasn't too much of a problem.\n\n**2025 update**: Yesterday I got a phone call, but I didn't answer it. She had the kids, and I'm kind of over the calls and texts so I didn't pick up.  Then she sent a text, which I'll summarize **\"I'm not sure what to do - I broke up with (GF name) this morning b/c something happened.  kids are scared, GF got mad and broke the backdoor screen window leaving the house when shutting the door.  I'm packing up her stuff and maybe it's best you take the kids for the day\".  I called back and told her, \"me taking the kids off your hands is for emergency reasons: sickness, missed a flight, car won't work, car broke down, or something of that nature.  I'm not here to assist in your relationship issues\".**  She kept the kids, and then texted me she was sorry for the text and later she followed up with a \"I'm sorry for involving you in my problems\" email and admitted that there was no danger or harm.  They've probably had problems for a long time, but this was the final straw. \n\n**Note: there was no physical abuse or threats.  Those back screen windows are housed flimsily in in the frame.  My parents back screen window has broken when it accidentally opened from a gust of wind. My ex followed up with me saying the kids are fine...just a loud noise the surprised them.  I never thought there was any abuse...just that the screen door was shut harder than was intended to cause it to break.**\n\n**My take/conclusion:**  Affairs don't work because they are born in secrecy, lies, and selfishness.  Gee, no wonder it didn't work...what could go wrong?  Two people who have an affair don't exactly excel in fidelity and relationships.  Now, in her late 30s with 2 young kids, she has to go back into the dating world explain that she cheated on her husband, and moved in her GF babysitter into the home, then broke up with her.  That's going to be a tough sell to solid dating partners.  Idiots will look past it, but the smart ones will see this woman as glowing white hot with risk. There's a bit more that happened, but that's the \"meat of potatoes\".\n\n**My Advice/lessons learned:**\n\nDon't get in fights, just move on with life.\n\nDon't weaponize kids.\n\nDon't drink alcohol for at least one year.  Give it away, or throw it out.\n\nWorkout: that could be walking a few miles each day and strength training 3-4 times a week.  It works wonders for mental health.  you'll feel better physically and mentally.\n\nFocus on career/education: you'll have much more free time.  Invest in yourself.  Not saying you need to get your Phd, but do something that helps further your career/education if it applies.",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone,  I’m reeling from a betrayal and need support or advice. I’m desperate to process this pain and hear from others who’ve been through something similar.\n\nI’m a woman in my 40s, a single mom to a 9-year-old daughter, working full-time and in school. I was with my fiancé (40s, M) for 8 years in a long-distance relationship that felt so real—daily calls and texts, monthly visits, and him joining me on work trips a few times a month. I even shared my Google location with him. Last September, we had a magical 10-day trip to Europe. We got engaged 2 years ago, planned our future, and were looking at houses together. I loved him deeply and thought we were building a life and he was such a gentleman and easy going person. My daughter knew him and liked him, though I was careful introducing them, and we took family trips, even to his hometown.\n\nHe’s in a high-level job with a demanding schedule—unscheduled meetings and constant work. I’m busy too, juggling school, work, and parenting, so I didn’t question his time constraints. I could call him anytime, and he’d answer or call back immediately. He comes from a religious family who’d see divorced woman as a hore, so I didn’t mind not meeting them. He met my friends, coworkers, and family. He recently accepted a new high-level job in another state starting mid October, and I agreed to move in with him and marry once he was settled.\n\nThen, my world shattered. I discovered he’s been married the entire time with two kids, one born around our engagement. In shock and pain, I sent his wife proof (photos, videos, travel tickets, engagement party pics). She said she hasn’t cared about him for years and is fine if I marry him, leaving me so confused. Did I ruin their family for nothing?\n\nHe’s now messaging me, claiming he was planning to leave her and took the new job to start fresh. I don’t know what to believe. Part of me still loves him, and I hate myself for it. I feel ashamed and guilty for telling his wife,  I can’t focus in school, sometimes feel like I can’t breathe, and haven’t told anyone because I’m too ashamed. i dont even have any family here. please don't ask me how i didn't know,i simply trusted him and never thought someone can lie for this long and never get cought,how would some one navigate work and kids and another \"serious\" relationship\n\nI’m drowning in guilt, love, anger, and fear. How do I heal from this betrayal? Has anyone felt guilty for exposing a partner’s lies? How do you stop loving someone who hurt you so much? How do I protect my daughter and myself? Any advice or stories would mean so much. Thank you.",

When asked about this he would become defensive. Due to my increase in paranoia I checked his phone (which i never do in relationships but my gut feeling was telling me otherwise) now there was nothing directly incriminating but i did see multiple log ins to whatsapp, which this day an age doesn’t make sense to have. I questioned his reasoning behind using it and his excuse was that it was out of boredom. Right then and there i knew it was fishy. He then began to cry and said he is scared our relationship will become affected because i don’t trust him. Well i felt horrible, thought i was the problem, i became quite depressed thinking something was wrong with me, he would ask if im overthinking again etc. \nFrom that day onward we have had a great relationship, memories, respect, laughs and feel loved by him. \nFast forward to beginning of this year (now 6 years into the relationship) we are both 31 and have been talking about marriage and everything came flooding back. I felt physically sick with my gut feelings where i knew i had to ask him again. \nSo i did and he ADMITTED to speaking to people online and whatsapp for sexting/photos etc. He was adamant he was never cheating physically. He says it was eating him up keeping this hidden for so long.  \ni was gutted. I have forgiven him, and since then we have had a big year of travelling and lots of weddings. I have only told one other friend who had a similar situation and her and her now wife have two kids together. And she has been my only support because a part of me wants to protect him too\nHe went to see a psych and continues to see one for multiple other things and he put it down to seeking external validation/porn addiction. \nI want to reconcile, i want to heal from this. It has gotten easier but its still there and some days a lower than others. I feel utterly alone in this. I trust him but the gaslighting and manipulation at the time really impacted me as i have had partners that were continuously like that in the past. \nBut i know he’s not like that at his core. \nHe is a completely different person at this stage in our relationship compared to when we first met and way more mature. \nNot sure what i’m looking for, maybe some guidance ? \nSorry for the long post.  \n  ",

My SIL is very controlling and manipulative but everyone went along with it because she is a pediatric oncologist and “so smart”.\n\nMy brother’s mental health suffered greatly after their move to another state and hospital. He went inpatient for SI and depression. He did everything he could. Even ECT and daily therapy. She showed her “unwavering support” on Facebook with showy posts about the importance of taking care of your mental health while exploiting my brother.\n\nAll of a sudden she told him to get out of the house. Nothing happened. I’ve questioned him many times if there was an antecedent. She is just not in love with my brother anymore. She tells him to do things like take care of the dog and the kids but also lashes out when it’s lot done perfectly.\n\nAnyway I heard from my mom that my brother was jealous of a colleague that works in the same department who is divorced. He went to her office one day and they were in there talking and laughing. One night the girls called my brother crying saying they couldn’t find mom. She supposedly was having a bonfire with friends but the girls couldn’t find her. She frantically called and gave an excuse the next day. My brother saw the location of his car on his phone when she borrowed it. It was at the divorced guys house. When he confronted her, she freaked out and blamed it on him. She went out to a comedy club without my brother all dressed up and the guy was there. Pictures were posted of their girls at a soccer game cheering for the guys daughter.\n\nWhile I don’t have full proof of I saw them, I feel morally responsible for mentioning this possibility to him. I feel that she is trying to keep my brother hooked until three months is up. That’s when you can legally divorce in New York. He is also in a fragile mental state ruminating over ever text, action, and it’s making him sicker. I told my parents that we need to intervene but they think he needs to find out on his own. Sorry this was so long. Btw there are photos on instagram of these conferences she goes to internationally and he is those pictures with her spanning over a year and a half",

      "selftext": "We’ve been together for 7 years, married for 3. My wife has always had a habit of omitting things she doesn’t think are “important.” Once she decides something isn’t relevant, she shuts down any discussion or accountability around it — which has become a serious issue in our marriage.\n\nShe works in an office environment and has made friends there, both male and female. About two years ago, during a rough patch in our relationship (after she caught me watching porn and felt betrayed), she started talking about her work life more — office gossip, coworkers, projects, etc. I got so familiar with her stories that I could name most of her coworkers by memory.\n\nThen one day, she mentioned her “friend” Jonathan, who was giving her advice on buying an Xbox for my son’s Christmas gift. The name immediately stood out — she’d never mentioned him before. When I asked who he was, she said, “Oh, just someone I work with,” and brushed it off like it was nothing.\n\nThat didn’t sit right with me. I asked how long she’d known him and why I’d never heard about him, especially since I’d heard about everyone else on her team. She said she didn’t think it was relevant. I pointed out that if this guy knew details about our family, like what we were getting my son for Christmas, their conversations clearly went beyond work.\n\nI told her I wasn’t comfortable with her having personal conversations with him and asked her to stop communicating outside of work topics. She got defensive, accused me of being jealous, and called my boundary unreasonable. I explained this wasn’t about control — it was about honesty and respect. She reluctantly agreed, though clearly resentful.\n\nThree months later, she slipped up and mentioned him again. When I confronted her, she admitted she’d never stopped talking to him because she “didn’t agree” with my request. That cut deep. I told her it wasn’t about agreement — it was about respect.\n\nThen this pattern continued for two years.\nShe’d swear she cut contact, but then it would slip out that she hadn’t. Each time, she’d justify it by saying there was “no attraction,” so it wasn’t a big deal. Eventually, he was transferred to another team that had zero connection to hers — no work overlap at all — yet she still chose to keep him in her life as her “work friend.”\n\nEvery time she got caught, she’d only admit to part of the truth. Gaslighting and justification became her default. If I tried to talk about it, she’d get defensive, throw my past mistakes back at me, and then shut down — sometimes giving me the silent treatment for days.\n\nIt wasn’t until I printed out the definitions and signs of emotional affairs and gaslighting that she finally stopped denying what had been happening.\n\nShe eventually admitted that things got “too close” emotionally, though she insists it never became physical. She says she’s sorry, wants to rebuild trust, and claims she’s cut off all contact for good.\n\nBut honestly… I don’t know if I can ever look at her the same way again.\n\nI love my wife, but I don’t trust her anymore. I find myself questioning everything — what she says, who she texts, even when she’s late from work. I can’t unsee how easily she lied and justified it for so long. I still feel like there are pieces of the story I don’t know.\n\nIt’s like something inside her changed — or maybe I just see her differently now. The best way I can describe it: imagine you’re eating something you love, something perfect, and then it falls into the dirt. You know it still has the same flavor, but the thought of eating it again makes you sick. That’s how I feel about us right now.\n\nAnd here’s the part that scares me most — I’ve started wondering if the only way I’ll ever truly get past this is by emotionally connecting with someone else. Not out of revenge, but just to feel something again. The fact that my mind even goes there makes me feel guilty, but I can’t shake it.\n\nI don’t want to give up on my marriage, but I also don’t know how to keep living in this cycle of mistrust.\n\nTL;DR: My wife had a 2-year emotional affair with a coworker, lied about ending it multiple times, and gaslit me whenever I confronted her. She insists it never got physical and wants to rebuild trust, but I’m broken inside and don’t know if I can ever truly see her the same way again.",

Telegram, Kik, Snapchat, what’s app (locked chats). Now here’s where it was awful he downloaded Grindr and other apps to find bisexual, trans women etc. he used twitter. He paid for only fans. He made multiple emails. He used credit cards I didn’t know about. Checking accounts I didn’t know about. He spent $4000+ on only fans, 1 female escort, 1 trans woman, hotel rooms that he never showed up to. He swears he only physically cheated 2 times. 1 time with the female escort and 1 time with the trans woman. \n\nI am still torn. I have saved all of the credit cards statements and have the emails of him contacting multiple escorts and the emails with the one he actually slept with. I was not able to save anything from what’s app because he deleted everything. \n\nWe are now at the point of “I promise I’m never doing this again”, he is sharing his location, he is handing me all of his credit cards, I have all of his passwords.

Our marriage is otherwise great.\n\nFor additional context; it was emotional (and somewhat physical but not sexual) cheating early in the marriage. We are both very young adults. I can provide more context if needed, but it started with her feeling unsafe due to my father's aggression. The affair partner was her ex-boyfriend.\n\nI have not met anyone else in my situation so I feel like an anomaly who no one understands. I am constantly suffering with shame, intrusive thoughts, and judgment towards my wife. I feel like self-respect and staying after infidelity cannot truly coexist. \n\nIs it possible to be happy again, or will I always consider myself to be an unconfident loser for staying and be depressed forever?",

I wouldn’t fully love him either, probably? \n\nThis is the shortest explanation… and it’s still pretty long… if you read through it… thank you. \n\nI’ve gone back multiple times after him cheating. So I know I’ve put myself in this position. We got married young and have 2 kids. We’ve separated a halfful of times and were even separated in different states for 2 years at one point. I really thought that would have been the best thing for us. Both did therapy. Together and separate. \nWe both have grown individually and it seemed together at some points. He just has never healed from a lot of childhood things, but we’re too old now for this to continue being a reason. (He doesn’t say it’s a reason, but between therapy and life it’s known it’s PART of the reason along with him actively making choices.) \n\nWe have kids. I’m now a SAHM and his job takes him away a lot and is actually quite important. Even when I was in the Military his job needed to come first to where I usually had to do the emergency stuff with the kids. Which is going to keep being the case. So it just would be easier for everyone for us to stay together and I continue to try building my business and taking care of the kids at home. And maybe one day we can fall back in love with each other. \n\nI have never thought it was okay to stay FOR your kids, but to try harder because of your kids.\n\nBut I am a hopeless romantic. And I know I deserve to be with someone who loves me unconditionally. I just don’t know if I’ll find that in this lifetime and if it’s worth putting my family through another separation if we live together “fine.” The kids love their dad. He’s an amazing dad and despite what he’s done to me, he’s not a bad person. He just is learning how to be a better person and was never taught to be a husband. I also was never taught how to be a wife or how a husband should be. And I feel I am doing better and have always been better and learning how to be and what that should look like… ahead of him. \n\n",

      "selftext": "It’s been 3 years since I think it happened, 1 year of no contact and only now am I waking up to his lies, covert manipulation and always playing the victim. A nice guy narcissist. Piece by piece, stories are trickling in and making sense in a way they didn’t before and I could not see it cause I was so vulnerable and experienced so much trauma. \n\nAround the time I think it had happened, I had just found out I was pregnant (it either was just before or just after). This was not a planned pregnancy and we had only been together 5 months at this point. I had just moved to LA, with him promising to move there with me.  When I found out I was pregnant he was already giving me excuses as to why he wasn’t able to get a job out there as he had promised.  He was a teacher and said he couldn’t get the document he needed to get his California license (realizing this was probably bull shit too). \n\nThe first story he tells me is about his “crazy” co-teacher. It was his first year teaching economics (he had always taught government, so said he was nervous, didn’t know what he was doing and was extra reliant on her) and he felt overwhelmed. The first week back at school, teachers only, his co-teacher, S, tells him that people are gossiping about him and she’ll tell him, but not at school. Her house is close to the school, so they can go there and she’ll tell him the gossip there. He tells me they go to her house and when they get there, she says she needs to change into something more comfortable. She goes to change and comes out in a very revealing top. She offers him wine - she drinks; he doesn’t. She sits uncomfortably close to him. Honestly I don’t remember how this story ends but it’s all about him being the victim and she’s crazy and coming onto him. I think he told me that she told him the gossip and he left. \n\nThroughout the fall, while I’m pregnant, scared, financially dependent on him (he said he wanted to support me and invest in my dreams…I stupidly accepted), broke, desperately trying to figure out what to do, he calls me and CONSTANTLY complains about her. S did this, S did that. S is obsessed with Taylor Swift and bonds with all the girls about her. When he does answer the phone, it’s to talk about her. At the time, I simply believed what he was telling me - that she was the problem and pursuing him. That he was under so much stress because he doesn’t know what he’s doing and she’s crazy. She’s always telling him how hot she is. She’s telling him about all the different dates she went on. She says all the guys at school want to eff her. She’s complaining about being hungover.  She’s all over the place. When we were talking about her - he wasn’t answering his phone. He would put it on silent most of the time. \n\nOne weekend I had this huge writing event where a screenplay I wrote was being read aloud in front of a bunch industry people. It was one of the biggest moments of my life. He couldn’t fly out he/we decided because of money, but he said he would zoom in. I zoom called him at the scheduled time that Saturday afternoon/evening. He didn’t answer his phone (again). He later told me he was sleeping. \n\nDuring this entire time, I’m panicking, terrified, alone and pregnant, he is emotionally distant and completely checked out. “Do what you want” he tells me. It’s becoming apparent that he has no intention of moving to LA, even though I moved there thinking he would join me.  “It’s your decision (to stay or go back), I can’t make this decision for you, I don’t want you to resent me for your decision,”\n\nAlso around this time, he gets into an altercation at the local convenience store. Once again, he cries victim. These kids were harassing the cashier he tells me.  He says he “snapped” and grabs one of the kids by the neck and throws him out of the store. The kids start recording him (typical genZ) and call the cops. The cops follow up and luckily the kids don’t press assault charges. \n\nLater he tells me another story about how, S followed him into a private room and took her shirt off in front of him complaining she was hot.\n\nS’s daughter goes to the school and apparently she “hates” him (why is the daughter emotionally invested in him?)\n\nAt almost 11 weeks pregnant, alone, I miscarried.  So much other shit happened I don’t have time to get into here. But all I say is to this day what I experienced was incredibly traumatic and I still don’t have answers. In the aftermath I decide to move back near him (I had a half sister there who had a stroke the same day as my miscarriage) cause he says he wants to work on things and he there for me. Trauma bonded but it would be 2 more years of the same vullshit victim stories about why he couldn’t show up for me.  Why he quite literally couldn’t do anything but would constantly profess his love and how I was “the one.” When I tried to leave. \n\nI’ve had 2 psychics tell me - there’s something he’s not telling you. \n\nOnly just now, as I have emerged from the wreckage of all that, am I able to see - I think he cheated. \n\nI think what enrages me the most, is that if he had been honest, it could have spared me. It could have helped me make sense of everything and spared me 2 more years of suffering, of wondering, of confusion of blaming myself of thinking what did I do wrong or how I could have been so stupid.  And I still don’t even have the answers to this day. \n\nWhat do you think?\n",

      "selftext": "I’ve been with him since high school. We grew up together. We’ve lived through the deaths of both our closest parents (his mom to cancer, my dad through heart attack). We have four kids together. The most recent child is only 4 months old. \n\nYesterday I took our eldest daughter (only 6 years old) to her play therapy appointment (she is undergoing assessment for autism) and as I’m waiting for her to finish her appointment I go through our Google Photos to look for these photos he took of a dollhouse I’m trying to get rid of on Facebook. As I’m scrolling I see a screenshot he accidentally took of his only fans messages. He’s been soliciting women on the website. Trying to strike up conversation with them. \n\nI’m livid. I call him and ask him to explain. He says it’s just porn. He will never actually meet these people. But here’s the thing, this isn’t the first time. And the last time he DID try to meet up local women on Reddit but I caught him. Here we are again and sure these women aren’t local but he’s still trying to form some sort of connection with them. It’s like he needs to feel special to these women. More special than just a regular guy watching their videos. He wants them to know him. For him to know the daily mundane aspects of their lives. “How was your day” kind of bullshit. \n\nI come home. Of course he’s already deleted the onlyfans account. I ask him to log into his bank account. He has no choice and so he does and as he’s logging in, he says ok I did spend some money. Almost $300 in two days. \n\nI asked wtf is the money for. What are they doing? He claims the send him videos and pictures. But this guy is a pro porn watcher. I’ve never banned him. He’s never had to hide it from me. But he just has to push it further. I have no knowledge of OF. What is the money for? Can someone enlighten me?\n\nAnyways I’m now navigating how to move forward without blowing up my children’s lives. I’m on maternity leave. My kids are all really REALLY young. I care about their stability and I am thinking from every angle how to protect them. The marriage is over but we still have to parent together whether I like it or not. \n\nTo kick him out of the house would put myself and my kids in financial distress. So keep him here is what I’ll do. But how do I keep myself sane in the meantime. What do we do for special occasions like thanksgiving and Christmas and birthdays. I need to preserve their childhood as much as I can. \n\nThe most infuriating part is he had a beautiful stable childhood. His parents didn’t fuck around and stayed together and yet he turns around and does this to his own children. I come from a broken family I know what it’s like. Our wedding anniversary was in just a few days. It’s all just so incredibly selfish. He tried to play it off like he might have a porn addiction. But porn addiction doesn’t mean you actively try to connect with strangers on the internet. That’s just cheating point blank. \n\nAny advice or words of encouragement is appreciated. I have no family except for my kids and of course I’m not going to them for this. I’m completely alone in this and need to make the right decisions while not losing my mind to rage in the meantime. \n\nThanks in advance for reading. I’m sorry that we are even in this group. ",

      "selftext": "It's honestly so hard even now to talk about everything that happened between my ex and I. I cried and begged and lost everything. When we broke up I lost the house, and when I had our son I'd get a hotel. Now when I didn't have him I lived out of my car to try to save money for the days that I had him. Looking back at how low of a point that one in my life is so heartbreaking. I really had a lot of bad thoughts and even talking about it now makes me so emotional. I really can't even explain how grateful I am to have come so far. It's still such a struggle but I really have found a new love for life with my child. \n\nWhen me and my ex had first gotten together we were in high school. We had known each other since elementary school and legit lived down the street from one another so we played as little kids and hung out even as we got older. We never really considered dating until high school, but we had gotten really close and hit it off during Covid. We spent day after day together and moved into a place together when we were 18 (which was probably not smart) but I was in love and stupid. When we first got together he was best friends with this girl that just gave me a weird gut feeling. We had played online games all three of us together and she just got weird when I played with them and when they played together they definitely had more fun.\n\nWhen we first moved into the new house she came over when I wasn't there to congratulate him and to see the new house cause I guess he also invited her. When she came over apparently she tried to jump into his arms which he told me he thought it was \"weird\" but then that she had stared at him and leaned into kiss him when he put her down. He said he immediately had her leave and texted me right after (which he did text me). After a couple years of us being together and them not being friends anymore I honestly had forgotten about her. That was until we started having issues \n\nWe had some major issues with him wanting to go to the military and me not agreeing with it so he let me stay in the house while we were both still paying on it. When I told him I didn't want to move across country he freaked out over me not wanting to support his dreams even though he had never mentioned it until randomly! This made him move back to his mom's house. When he moved back there I begged and cried for him to come back, and he stayed there for maybe a month. After that he moved back in with me and we kinda hit it back off and things seemed good again. Then we were at a dinner with his mom and his mom was trying to make a point about how much he loved me and how when we were split up (on our \"break\") he had only had one girl come over. I immediately was like wait wtf and looked at him but didn't bring it up until after. Come to find out it was Jenna. \n\nHe apologized and got emotional over it and told me they did nothing when she was there and just talked and that was it. I asked what they talked about and he said they just talked about random stuff. I dropped it cause I didn't wanna lose him and we had just moved back in together. \n\nAfter a couple more years together I ended up pregnant and we broke up a week before I had our son. Leading up to it we had a ton of issues with him wanting to go out to bars or out with work friends for little \"team activities\" they did. A week before I had our son I found out he was seeing her and freaked out over it so he kicked me out of the house and I took our baby stuff to my parents. He never showed up to the birth of our child and didn't even mention it until a few days after he was born. This shattered my heart on so many levels I seriously can't even explain it. ",

Through therapy I realized my reasons for going into this relationship 15 years ago was a feeling of trust and safety I got from him at the cost of other things that were very important to me where we simply weren’t compatible. I was so focused on finding someone who was loyal and would never cheat on me. Joke’s on me.\n\nWe have a young child. We were a happy stable family and I took pride in how I was breaking generational trauma in my family and giving my son the safety and stability I lacked growing up. I hate the thought of divorce. I also hate the thought of staying in an empty soul-less relationship until I die. \n\nThings are calm now, my anger has diminished significantly but I’ve checked out. I’m sad and grieving the life I thought I had with a man that would forever be my person and I could be his. I fear change and the unknown.\n\nI don’t need to stay- I’m financially independent.

He said he did it because he was unhappy in our relationship and told me that many times. I tried to fix our relationship but he already seemed checked out and pulled back from me more and more. It was because he was in a relationship with her (they became exclusive with each other in Sept while he was still with me).\n\nThe other woman showed me screenshots of what he said to her the morning I confronted him about finding out about everything. I broke up with him and he said \"I love you and I always will.\"\n\nThen immediately he sent her this text that she showed me. He said to her \"I want nothing more than to be in bed with you rubbing your back and listening to you talk about your day. The relationship I had with her has been over for a long time I just wasn't man enough to end it because I was afraid of what she would do. She's manipulative. We have not been in love for awhile. I will work every day to fix this between us. I will recourt you. I will make you feel like the amazing, beautiful, perfect person you are. I will be there for you emotionally and physically, always.\" He blocked me after.\n\nHe told me every day that he loved me. He strung me along and I believed we were ok, even though we had arguments we were working on I had no idea he had been doing this behind my back the last 4 months. He carried on like everything was normal. I am devastated and heartbroken and numb. I can't stop picturing them together and knowing all of his love was just transferred to her makes me feel sick. Hes moving on without skipping a beat and Im completely alone.\n\nI loved him more than Ive ever loved anyone and I can't believe he could just replace me like this. They even went on a mountain road trip last weekend together out of town, he told me he went with his guy friend and couldn't call me because of \"bad service.\" I feel like I am in a nightmare I can't wake up from. Please give me some advice on how to process and deal with this?\n\nTLDR; Fiance of 2 years cheated on me with a 44F for the last 4 months.

      "selftext": "I'm (34F) going through it right now. I broke up with my partner (40M) on September 14th. There were other lies that I had uncovered and I had to just cut it off. I was worried I made that decision too soon. \n\nHours after we broke up, I found out he had a whole dating profile. A part of me wanted to maybe eventually make it work, regardless. \n\nI asked multiple times if he slept with anyone else, and he kept telling me that he can't answer that question yet, but when he can it will all make sense. He finally came clean, and he did sleep with someone - I thought this person was just a friend, she never even crossed my mind that way - and he found out at the beginning of August that she is pregnant. \n\nFrom the timeline he gave, he would have had sex with her very shortly after I had a miscarriage. He told me that he heard the heartbeat, which I never had a chance to do with mine. He also told me that he did not tell her about me until right before he came clean to me, 2 weeks after our breakup, which is also insanely unfair to her because she could have used that information in her decision making process. \n\nI don't know how someone could be making future plans with me, and saying he loved me every day, and reassuring me that my feelings are valid when I came to him with a concern... Could do THIS. It's awful. I really feel like I won't recover from it. It has been traumatizing. \n\nI have no plans of getting back together with him, but it's hard to let go. I know my nervous system is on overdrive, and my brain is telling me so many conflicting things right now. \n\nA little more context: we were together a lot of 2024 also, and I broke up with him then due to lack of commitment. He asked for me back multiple times, and I gave in at the beginning of this year, was honest about our time apart to him, and I defended him to my friends and family because they knew he would hurt me again, and I had faith he wouldn't. \n\nA lot of people in my life are telling me to essentially just forget him. I am also someone who uses humor as a coping mechanism, so I think maybe it's not taken as seriously. It's hard. It's easy when you are not in this situation, and you're on the outside looking in, to say that you would just forget them... But when you're in it, it's hard. I can't bring myself to believe that the genuine moments we had together weren't real. I can't bring myself to stop focusing on the memories we made. I love this person, I have been patient with this person, and devoted to him... And thought that this connection was the best connection I had, ever. I really thought he was the one. \n\nNow, he has this baby on the way, that he knew about for over a month and a half before we broke up, and he has even asked for me back before I knew about that. I reached out to this girl to give her the context of us, and I really left a lot out... I don't want to traumatize a pregnant woman who didn't know about me. She's not to blame either, she is also a victim in this... But I also can't help but feel resentment towards her. I'm terrified of somehow seeing updates about the pregnancy announcement, or  gender reveal, or the baby shower, or even the photos of the baby... I'm worried I'll finally be healing when I somehow stumble upon those. \n\nHe said, after him admitting this, that he will always love me. And that he has not given up on the thought that we could be together again. I am firm in my decision, and I have finally blocked him everywhere... But it's hard. Very hard. \n\nNo real goals of this post. I have been lurking on this page since I found out about the dating profiles. If anyone has any words of advice, who has been in this situation or one similar to it, that would be appreciated. I'm really committed to moving on and letting go, and never getting back with him... I really just want this feeling to go away. ",

At home, nasty to me, picking fights, guarding his phone (because his job was sooo important!). It was like the earth was pulled out from under my feet. However, he was extremely remorseful. Apologized and promised to do better. We had teenagers at that point, going through a lot of teenage drama. I decided to stay and try out 'marriage 2.0' (as he put it). A month ago, found that he had been contacting and meeting the same woman for the last 2 years at least. I am done! But I am now in my late 50's and have never lived alone. I have devoted 34 years of my life to this man....and I am devastated. Don't know how to move forward.",

      "selftext": "For context - this is my wife's (26F) first attempt to give me (33M) a formal and genuine apology after claiming it was too difficult for her to express her feelings & show remorse due to the high stress of the situation. I was telling her I needed a good apology and for her to display some sort of remorse / regret.\n\nAlso, I only found out about everything because I reallllly persisted in questioning her when she came home from \"shopping with her mom\". Her location was stagnant in an apartment for 2hrs and she denied it twice on the phone and at least 5 times when I confronted her at home. She claims to have \"only kissed and cuddled and stuff\" but I don't really know what to believe unfortunately. She was also at that same location a week or so before for 3-4 hours very late at night. I assumed it was one of her girl friends friends places or something like that... idk 😔\n\nAnyways, we are at the point now where she gets upset if I suggest needing an apology. She'd say she's already done it, and that I just wont accept it anyways... But she still hasn't come to me in person apologizing genuinely because SHE wants to. It's always been because I've asked for it. She shuts down so much in person that she can pretty much only do it through text... which sucks because I feel like its far less impactful that way. \n\nAnyways, I was just wondering what you guys thought of this example. I remember telling her that I appreciated it, but there was a part of it that rubbed me the wrong way a bit and ultimately made me feel worse.\n\nHere it is-- https://imgur.com/a/B4RTdpl",

I moved back to the east coast to be closer to family.  I have more support now as a single dad. My ex and I share 50/50 custody of our 14month old. \n\nI’m living in my own apartment, started a new job, I’m applying for grad school, and I got back to the gym regularly. The divorce is almost finalized. Overall, I feel like things are settling out. I’m proud of myself for surviving a bunch of crap and all the mind games. I feel like I’m stronger now mentally and emotionally.\n\nMy ex sent me a text a couple weeks ago in which he tried to rewrite the narrative of what happened. He implied that we came to a mutual decision to divorce because we realized we weren’t right for each other. After “hours of self reflection and therapy,” he now knows what he needs in a partner. The guy cheated on me more than 10x, gas lighted me, exposed me to STIs, and lied to me. When I told him I wanted a divorce, he was hospitalized for two weeks for severe anxiety, depression, and SI. We briefly tried reconciliation therapy but I knew that my trust in him and respect for him was gone.\n\nWe both moved back to the east coast. We still see each other occasionally for childcare handoff (thankfully most handoffs occur through daycare). It’s tough seeing him because he puts on this happy, friendly demeanor with everyone, but I know he’s fake. I want to scream it to the world but I don’t think that is going to help. \n\nI can’t help but wonder what he is telling people (old friends, new colleagues, etc.) about his current situation. Am I the horrible ex who left him? I know he isn’t telling them the truth. \n\nAnyway, I know a lot of this is out of my control, but any advice on having to continue to deal with an ex after getting betrayed?",

Wife had bought me, (recommended by my mom,) an air brush set because of my art talents. It was my 33rd and felt very good about the day. Before that, we had got our taxes back, she had helped me buy a 500 dollar keyboard to get back into my music talents, I was very happy about that and loved her for it. Anniversary evening, we had went out to Lamberts restaurant, home of the thrown rolls, a very enjoyable evening despite the cold drizzly March weather. The very first time seeing Lamberts and their Santa Fe train set on the upper wall that ran continuously, so cool. I still remember what I had, liver n onions, mashed potatos, green beans and peach cobbler. Then the ride back home when she asks about going out with her niece for girls night out. For the first time ever, I told her, \"No, I don't want you to go out,\" She persisted and pressed why, I didn't know, I just didn't want her going out that next night. She finally sighs and says fine,...but she wakes me up the next night for work, dressed and waiting on her niece like she didn't remember my no about it at all.\n\nUntill that night, that entire year had been fine between us, I never seen that storm cloud looming, but some entity did, and put that clench in my stomach and that \"No!\" in my answer. It baffles me to this day how rapidly an event can take place without seeing any indicators that weekly routine, or even normal existance along side your spouse can be lost in one thoughtless moment. Sometimes I still find myself putting the puzzle together or examining the pieces to make other sense of it, including myself and my awareness at the time.",

      "title": "The Divorce is Final, I'm Devastated.",
      "selftext": "This Monday, it happened. We're divorced; we're no longer married...the last tether is gone. I'm utterly crushed; I was spiraling out since I saw the final date about two weeks before. I reached out, we hadn't spoken in 1.5 months, and our last conversation was painful and heated, and I thought that's it. It's done and I hate him, and I think that allowed me to stay away to keep busy but after weeks I started to feel run down with my routine: early morning walk, work, gym, chores, reading, meal prep. I started to feel like I really miss him in my life, I started to encounter things that triggered me in one way or another: happy, longing, sadness, all of it.\n\nSeeing the dissolution date, made me feel numb and frozen. I felt angry, hurt, panicked all over again. I thought, I don't want this, I don't want this. I do not want this to end! I also felt angry like this is all his fault. The day also happened to be the same day one year ago WS/AP were first physical, and it felt like such a cruel joke. I sent an email, calling out the cruel irony, this awful anniversary of their first time together and now our divorce. I told him I hope it haunts him for the rest of his life, the way it will haunt me. I dumped my pain and hit send then I heard nothing, and I said I'm at peace with it but then after a couple of days I started to spiral beating myself up for reaching out, reopening wounds, potentially triggering his shame and so much more. I cried, I had a full-on panic attack and questioned why, why, why did I do that?\n\nOn Monday, I reached out again. I sent him a text. I told him the email was coming from a place of deep hurt, and I shouldn't have sent it. He responded, he said he understood and asked about my family (serious health issues happening rn). It was nice, it was sad. I felt overwhelmed again, I started to cry and spiral, and I asked to seem him. I didn't want to be alone, I felt like I was there again...that dark, bad and scary place after D-day where I felt insane, where I was drowning, where I wanted to die.\n\nWe had a very intense day of crying and hurting, it was ugly and painful. I know he's not safe, I know he hasn't done the work...is there some change, some work...sure but it hasn't been nearly enough. You can see my post history, he has so much work to do, he has so far to go...if he's even truly capable of it...but seeing him, having the divorce be final, it's triggering all sorts of things in me. I don't want to let go, but I don't want to reconcile because I know he's not safe and I'm not healthy right now either, but I don't want to let go.\n\nWe hit pause, said we'll check-in next week. It was getting too intense again and I get it. It had been 1.5 months, and we were both trying to move forward in our ways and this pulled us back in but I also feel like it this is the process, grief, trauma, betrayal...even during the no contact...I still had these breakdowns, I still spiraled but I didn't reach out but I also know the contact makes it that much worse, that is sucks us back into an unhealthy cycle. I know this yet I reached out because it's so painful to walk away forever, it's so painful to know the marriage is over.\n\nThis grief, this pain, this trauma it feels truly unbearable some days. I don't know how I get through it, I don't know if I have years in me to get to a place where I finally feel okay and even then, this NEVER will leave me. What is my future? What awaits me? I'll never love the way I did again, I don't think I'll ever feel fully safe, at ease, there is no peace for me on the other side of this. There is fear, paranoia, trauma, triggers, there one foot out the door always and forever, it feels like there's nothing for me when it comes to love in the future.\n\nI know I need to love myself more than anything right now, I know I need to rebuild secure attachment, I know that I don't need a partner to complete me...I know all of this logically, but it doesn't help! Before him, I never thought of marriage or having a partner but after we met, I realized wow this is really nice, this is great actually. I love having a partner and best friend like this, I love sharing and building a life with someone and it's so hard to just let the idea of ever having that again go. Of course, it didn't stay great but at that point I was so attached, I wanted to fight for us, and he didn't, and I had no idea how much he was hiding from me.\n\nI just needed to vent, to dump, to hurt to speak out what is eating at me inside, \"I don't want to let go.\"",

      "title": "I Think My Wife Has Been Having Emotional Affairs Online for Years",
      "selftext": "My wife has been engaging in online relationships with men for years. I didn’t mind at first, as she was depressed and it helped her socialize. She mostly connected with people who shared her hobbies. We discussed it, and she swore that they were just friendships.\n\nRecently, however, she’s been feeling better, losing weight, buying new clothes, and even got lip filler for the first time. I was happy to see her investing in herself, especially since I knew she wasn’t having an affair. We both work remotely, so meeting someone in person would have been impossible.\n\nSome time ago, she became more involved in a group chat with a few men about their shared hobby. She’s constantly on her phone, texting while shopping, pausing the movies we’re watching so she can respond, and even guarding her phone - taking it with her everywhere and never leaving it for a minute. When texting and walking, she constantly changes direction so I can’t see what she’s doing.\n\nThis started making me suspicious. I began doubting whether this was really just a group conversation.\n\nA few days ago, she had a sudden work trip to another city. She wanted to grab drinks with people from the office because she had just started a new job, and there was a mini-party planned. It seemed like a reasonable excuse.\n\nRight before this trip, she went on a sudden shopping spree, buying lingerie and other clothes.\n\nWhen she left, she was wearing jeans and a sweater. When she came back the next day, I checked the laundry basket. She had actually worn a thong and fishnet tights and had shaved. The last time she wore a thong was five years ago, and she rarely shaves, so this was very unusual.\n\nI decided to look for more clues and found one older conversation with a man. It was 6 months ago, and we are married for years. She shared a selfie in a bra and told him she had no boyfriend. When he started advancing sexually, she didn’t shut it down but went along with it a little bit.\n\nThey jokingly discussed marriage for a better passport and sleeping in the same bed. She suddenly got scared, blocked him, but a few days later, they started talking again about regular things, and after some time, she stopped responding altogether.\n\nAll of her social media profiles have pictures from a few years ago to make her look younger. She uses multiple accounts and has very developed fake profiles as well.\n\nI’m worried that what I thought were just friendships and discussions about common hobbies might actually have been emotional affairs. I don’t have concrete proof, but I’m starting to think she’s finally decided to meet someone in person.\n\nHow should I proceed? Divorce? Counseling?",

      "title": "Just a release from this crazy breakup.",
      "selftext": "Sorry if I break rules or something. I just want to vent. This year has been crazy. \n\nI (36M) made several mistakes, I get that. I’m aware I have abandonment issues which I didn’t work on before hand. Several red flags I chose to ignore.\n\nBit of background, I moved from my hometown after a childhood of foster care and family trauma. I moved families over 64 times in 7ish years. I moved up country to be in close contact to my last foster family, and I’m so grateful for them.\n\nI’ve lived in West Midlands, uk for about 15 years.\nI was still unsettled for all that time and found it difficult to make friends. I tried dating and had a very small friend circle. \n\nI didn’t really date, I was anxious and a mess, so it wasn’t ever past drinks. I got social anxiety, depression, then Covid hit.\n\nDuring Covid I got put on some antidepressants, and literally prayed to find someone to save me. June 2021, I thought I found her (now F29), on bumble. Opening line was about having a breakdown. We met up, and we got on like a something I never felt. We kissed in the rain on the first date, and she ended up coming round to dry her clothes. She was here every day (red flag) She had a child (7) who wasn’t under her care (also red flag, ignored). She wasn’t working as she had recently moved to town, and waiting for a DBS check (red flags again ignored). I wasn’t ready to date but I didn’t know it.\n\nShe had been put on the tenancy of my 1bed flat in August (money was tight, she also had a lot of debt - red flag 🚩 but I also had some debt too). She also had a kitten that was missing and presumed dead - turned up 2 days after she officially moved in.\n\nWe made things work. She got the job but kept feeling like calling in sick 🚩. I persuaded her to start going, so we can get debts down, and get a bigger place. We didn’t go out much due to contrasting work hours, I’m 8:30-18:30 4 weekdays, she’s 7:45 -19:45 3 days a week, plus college 2 days a week, and her son every other weekend (🚩).\n\nThen in the following spring, I lost my job. My foster grandad died. I got back up and stabilised myself quickly. Paid off my debt as I got 3 months pay to leave. Found my dream job quickly. My working hours changed to 8:30-17:00 5 days a week. So I lost a day to do things like grocery shopping.\nI struggled to adapt at my new job. It was a bit of a big step up.\nAs we needed a car and a bigger place, I didn’t want her to not enjoy some life, and she went out with some girl friends a few times. My anxiety was on high alert throughout, because things were falling apart. No job. Deaths. Her child an ex drama. Her parent drama. Her not showing up at work. Trying to move to a bigger house. She didn’t help out around the house. She paid towards bills, but I paid for food as child maintenance payments took a bit out her paycheck.\n\nShe ended up having 2 drunk discussions with me about not being able to go out together. We were living in a cost of living crisis, and I’m managing the money so she can afford a £50/month gym membership with swimming pool, and we can eat nice food at home. And we can take her son out places when we have him. And Christmas I paid for most of it.\n\nI got codependent. I became anxiously avoidant. I had nowhere to breathe. I worked, I came home, I cooked, I ruminated over how she doesn’t help out with any household jobs I asked her to (🚩).\n\nWe gave up the cat (leasehold rules no pets). I felt bad. Then she started to hang out with a guy from college (M19) in Autumn. He came round mine. We all went to see fireworks. Around this time, she started going gym, and turning off her location (her parents were very critical of her behaviours towards her son, not wanting to be in his life as much etc… 🚩, and kept asking about her whereabouts). He had a car, so it was easier for her to see her son, and I felt that was the most important thing to her, so I repaid the kindness by inviting him to stuff.\n \nChristmas we wanted a quiet one, one for us. I paid for everything. I told her I can’t spend money until April. She understood. \nShe stopped talking the (M19), he had some breakdowns, and was found to be spiking both her and her friends drinks.\n\nAround February, we agreed she can fly home to see some friends in Poland. She wanted to hide it from her parents 🚩 as she wasn’t going for her son. She met a hefty childhood friend, and I asked her to behave, as I was naturally anxious, and she got annoyed.\nShe came back, all happy, and we planned the next steps. One of us drives, and then the bigger flat. As she had the kid, we agreed for her to. I had a root canal, and spent a lot of savings on that. Driving lessons continued.\n\nOne day, she lost her AirPods. Find my showed them near a block of flats. I had a look around but couldn’t find them. I asked if she was in the flats, maybe to see a friend. No. I believed her.\n\nThen, in May, I have a week off for her birthday. For 2 years every holiday had issues. A death. Christmas. Illness. Losing my job. There was always something. I told her I needed to rest, then the week we will get things back on track. Dates, days out. We wasn’t going to be able to move. I started to look at flights to Milan.\n\n1 day before her birthday (May), she comes home after drinking and has the talk. She moves out that week. I hide at my foster parents. She said she was going to live with the old landlord she lived with before me. Then there was some cracks. She kept in contact and sent pics, but they wasn’t of the landlords flat. She came round surprisingly fast one day for a talk. She pinned her leaving all on me not meeting her needs, and I told her I’d improve.\n\nI became trauma bonded. I couldn’t stop texting her. Asking her to come back.\n\nAround July, she came round, we slept together, and we agreed she can move back. The morning, I go on my walk and I see her, holding hands with another man (M50, but her told her he’s 35). She sees me and clings to his arm.\n\nI confronted her. It’s her driving instructor. Over the following few weeks, it unravels. She moved in with him right away. The place the AirPods were. I reasoned and almost begged. She agreed a few times to move back, but it just didn’t happen. She took paid sick leave from work and told me it was because she explained the situation. With the Summer holidays coming up, she said she was going away for a week with the son, and booked a flight to Rome.\n\nIn Rome, 4am UK time, I get calls from her, begging to help her come back to me. She’s called her friends to try borrow money for flights. I said no. She’s crying and all over the place. Her nan died. She had told work she needed time off for a family death, and then one actually happened.\n\nShe puts me on loudspeaker as she’s crying, and I hear him. Both clearly drunk. He’s calling her baby, and saying about marriage, and I just tell her to eat toast, drink water and sleep. He hears me. He knows it’s me. He yelling “you’re still speaking to him. The boring one who never takes you out? The one you’ve cheated on 7 times?”.\nShe flies home, drops off her son, and flies to Poland. She tells her parents she’s going to move back with me (they don’t know about him). She sends me naughty videos and sexts. I FaceTime the family.\n\nShe comes home, and she moves back in. 27th Aug. But she starts to get panicking. Waking up at 4:30am. I’m telling her to block his number. Just move on. She didn’t. 🚩 she met with him. This happens up to 31st August. But the 30th, we had an honesty day. She cheated on me with M19, whilst doing drugs. She cheated on me with polish friend. She cheated on me with the driving instructor, and he actually proposed to her and she said yes in Rome! That evening we go for a walk, and then to a pub, and he also turns up. She gives him back the ring.\n\nMy nervous system goes mental. I tell her if she goes sees him, she can just leave.  They end up meeting the next morning. She tells me she’s going to do that. He said he’s gonna get them a bigger flat and a dog (🚩)\n\nShe left the second time, 31st aug. I’m already in therapy as soon as May, as I know I wouldn’t cope. But it just got insane.\n\nI’ve followed through with the promise to sort my life out. Therapy. Gym. Healthy eating. Giving up medical cannabis and I’m off my antidepressants already (I didn’t take them whilst she had moved back in, and I was like “that was the worst part”, as I was already working off them). ChatGPT has helped me reflect. \n\nThat prayer for someone to save me, sort of came true. I want to fix myself now. I want that sort of happy relationship, but with someone who loves me.\n\nI still miss her, and broken NC a few times, \nShe told me she had an abortion, which was 17 weeks, so she would have been pregnant at the time of the split. I was too tired, ill and the antidepressants killed my sex drive a bit.  She’s even came round last week, still defending him, still wearing the ring. Telling me she still loves me and is looking at moving away from him, and would I accept her back if she turned up to my door with a puppy. She can’t afford a car, a flat and a puppy. I text her later saying I’m done with her lies. She rings later that day, asking to come see me (he’s doing a lesson obviously). I say no.\n\nShe’s sent a few further texts and emails, but when I’ve told her to not contact me a few days later, she’s forgotten, so she’s probably drunk texting me, or drunk emailing me. I miss having somebody here, but it’s not her. And it tears me apart.\n\nI saw her a few days ago, walking home past mine. She smiled and waved. I didn’t react. I wish she didn’t do those things. She could have made things work. I even miss her lying texts about how things could have been or how much she misses me, but it’s the trauma bond speaking. Not me. And I’m probably going to cry a bit tonight. Thank you for letting me rant, this has been my TED talk.\n\nEdit: just before she visited me last week, I had the week off on leave, I also found out my real grandad died via LinkedIn.\nShe’s also cheated on him with me a few times ",

He also works a lot on weekends and has very time consuming hobbies (golf, fishing, marathon running).  We have young children at home. He barely spends any time with me or our kids.  I have brought up that I need more help from him and I am feeling lonely and disconnected from him.  It made no difference, he was very dismissive.  \nLong story short I started checking his phone, and of course, I found out that his evenings are being spent with a female coworker about 2-3 evenings a week. It was actually very hard for me to figure this out as he deletes all their messagesg daily so at most I only saw a few messages here and there.  It’s a work phone and they were using WhatsApp. They also call each other often.  The messages I saw were mainly work related or just supportive -  but she did call him babe a couple times in messages I was able to see - ie “Babe sorry but I cant meet now”.  They seem to be comfortable discussing sex to some extent as well - one msg he said he was getting old as he was coming up 45 and she said “nothing changes after dark after 45”.  And he once said something to her like “is there anything I can do to make you feel better, I mean before 6:15 that is”.  She also sent him some selfies on and off including a couple of her in a bathing suit, I did not see his replies to those pictures.\n\n He has never mentioned this co worker to me.  When I confronted him he said it was just a supportive friendship and they help each other with the political side of work.  What are the chances he hasn’t cheated?",

He ended up purchasing a flight for later that year, and while here we spent a week with him and his parents (they had decided to join the trip), he begged me to get back together and asked me if he could move here. I was confused about why he was asking for permission. There were some lies involving a girl that had come up during the year that made me ultimately say no.   \n  \nI went back home for vacation and he had thrown himself full force at a relationship with her, 10 days after begging for me to take him back. He was planning trips with her and his friends literally 2 weeks since arriving from visiting me. He returns from said trips and reaches out, tells me he loves me, that she will never be able to replace me, that he was just going through a rough patch, that he needs us back together. We eventually do. I am back home at distance and I find out he's still seeing her. I give him silence, disappear. He begs - this time promising that his actions are more aligned. I believe him because things in his life had actually changed (job, he had been unemployed during this time) and we try again.   \n  \nThings are going well, I visit and spend a ton of time with him and his family, but a part of me wasn't healed from all the lies. I realize I need some space to process, so I create some distance. He sends me messages professing his love, his regret, he plans trips to see me here or meet me somewhere half way, but I don't reassure him, I think I was protecting myself. I found out again that he is back with her.   \n  \nI know I created the space and distance but I was still trying. I feel so stupid for trying. His family is extremely loving towards me, they are embarrassed. They have been so supportive and have always treated me like family - we've all travelled and shared so much together. Do they actually ever step up? If he does, is it possible to move past infidelity? ",

      "selftext": "My ex cheated on me by carrying out an affair while she was working remotely in CDMX. I won't go into details but I'm convinced she has some sort of cluster-b personality disorder because of the extent to which she was able to compartmentalize, lie, and manipulate me while she was doing it, which was over the course of a month and a half or so. I only know because she broke up with me out of nowhere and I confronted her with evidence that was irrefutable - otherwise she was never going to tell me. She contacted me twice to 'reconcile' but backed off both times when I mentioned the idea of her needing to take accountability beyond saying \"I'm sorry\" and at no point has really sought my forgiveness. I was and still am incredibly disturbed, I loved her deeply. \n\nI'm doing everything everyone told me to - going to the gym, working hard, I read Leave a Cheater Gain a Life, seeing a therapist, etc. - but I'm having an incredibly hard time getting it out of my head. I have a ton of trouble falling and staying asleep; I still have visions of her cheating and the idea that she'll end up with healed and with someone else (however unlikely that may be) nags at me constantly. I'm not an angry person but with how badly she messed my life up I find myself wanting her to be unhappy - but that's not who I am and makes me upset for even thinking like that. I'm just looking for any comfort and advice for my situation. Happy to provide any additional details.   \n",

Knowing what they were doing behind my back for months. Having to be in the same places that I would see them walking together back then, is heartbreaking. Some small things happened while we were all at work. The actual physical acts happened at her house on their lunch breaks. I keep trying to think back to that time and think of how he was. Was he different? Was he ignoring me? The answer is no. He never changed his behavior towards me. We still had sex, he still was engaging. It’s so confusing. He’s answers all my question. Even the hard ones. I wanted every detail I could think of. I know that’s not for everyone. I told him he needs to look for another job but he has a pretty high paying job where we are at. So that’s been a little difficult. I am just going through my day in a rollercoaster of emotions. One minute I’m fine, the next I’m ready to scream, the next I’m ready to cry. I have to fake that I’m okay at work because if other people find out it will be soooo embarrassing. And I have to fake it at home because we have kids who don’t deserve to be pulled into this mess.

I keep asking him why, what happened, why aren’t you upset about this, what are you gunna do (he still has keys to the office so he couldn’t actually be fired yet right?) but these questions are just make him mad, he claims to know nothing and is happy looking for something new. \n\nThis is really bothering me, I need answers. So the other day I snooped his devices and behold! A document stating he is being accused of MULTIPLE instances of sexual harassment at work.. \n\nSo it’s been a few days, he clearly does not know that I know. I also know he had a virtual meeting to discuss the allegations. I don’t want to look at him, he kisses me and my body goes numb. I’m lost here.  \n\nDo I confront him? I told one friend and we are going to talk more about it Friday, she thought to hold off on confrontation but it’ll have to happen eventually. I’m scared, I want to separate and have custody of our baby but I don’t have a job. \n\nUPDATE:\n\nFirst, thank you all for your helpful advice. It gave me the push to open up bc frankly I’m embarrassed.\n\nI told my sister and our family friend who is a lawyer. We kind of have a plan for talking to him. I decided it’s unforgivable considering the other things he’s done to me recently, I can’t keep living like this. I will be kicking him out this weekend. He has a job offer in another city I think he should take (it’s a great opportunity and he will be closer to his other son) and he can crash at a friends until he finds a place. He might also be offered a job in our town too so we will see what he decides. ",

Things have been so bad ever since then, though, and I‘m starting to think neither of us can heal from this. My biggest concern is the nosedive her mental health has taken since I found out. She says she was doing badly while she was being unfaithful and just hiding it from me, but ever since I discovered her secret she has been actively and violently suicidal near daily. I‘ve never seen her this bad in the many years we have known each other. I can’t help but feel like this horrible bout of depression she is in is directly my fault for finding out what she was doing, even if that obviously wasn’t within my control. I cant stop myself from feeling personally responsible for her wellbeing, to the point where I wish I kept the knowledge of what she was doing to myself so she wouldn’t end up suffering so much. She‘s done next to nothing to attempt to support my own mental health after I found out and I just feel so much guilt it‘s unbearable. ",

      "selftext": "July 22nd I saw my wife texting a man. I confronted her and she admitted an affair. She admitted it wasn't her first. She told me she didn't love me and never had. We have two kids 8 and 4.\n\nA few nights later she seemed to test the waters and said I could set up a counseling appointment. I was still in shock so I did. The next morning she left the house and returned telling me she had made an offer on a new home. \n\nI took some time off work and when i returned to work she emailed me a seperation agreement she had AI write. I've since gotten a lawyer and the agreement is almost done. I will be splitting the kids and staying in the matrimonial home. \n\nFor a few weeks after she stayed living here going out after the kids were in bed. The nights she stayed in she'd get drunk and cruel. My son was sick and came home from daycare. She said she had an appointment and then casually rolled in close to midnight not even inquiring about our son. The next night she got drunk and was laying on the couch texting I went to the kitchen and she was smiling like a mad woman staring at me, when I asked if she was ok she said she'd never been better with this wild smirk, was like I was seeing a stranger. The next day she said she was going out and would be home later. When she came back I asked if she would stay at her mom's as things were tense and she wouldn't have to sneak around, she agreed. \n\nSince she's moved out we mostly just talk about the kids and our agreement. I stupidly messaged to ask for some type of closure but realize she cannot provide me with any. Her behavior has been better though she still gets quite snippy with me. \n\nThe last few months of the relationship hadn't been great and she'd grown cold and distant and I realize now why. We had a vacation early in july with the family and it mostly seemed good. I was really caught off guard when I found out but now thinking back I don't even know how I missed it. So many bizarre reasons for leaving at night, so many weird stories. So much working late. So many nights out with the girls and coming home the next day. I feel like an absolute idiot. \n\nMy self worth is terrible. I feel like a shell. When I have the kids I feel like a zombie making them dinner and getting them ready for school. This is no way to live. She's now living at her mom's and told me she's still seeing ap. She said she has no immediate plans to introduce but said it's not out of the question in time. What a punch to the gut. My nights without the kids I sit here and read these forums and lay in bed. I've lost 37 lbs and my sleep is terrible. I have nightmares when I do sleep. \n\nIts like a mask fell off my wife and now that I've seen her she's evil. Was she ever even real. \n\nMakes the last 13 years of my life feel like an absolute lie. Like I lived in a different world than her. When I think back it's as if none of it mattered. \n\nThanks for letting me vent. \n",

      "selftext": "This is the story of my marriage and divorce. I think I’m writing this mostly for me, but also to possibly see what some others think. I’m using a throwaway so that I can be brutally honest.\n\nLet’s start at the beginning, around 2007. We’re both attending the same university in the US, she’s an international student and I’m an American. I was the kind of shy but smart guy from class that she knew, and she was the cute international student from Thailand. We were in a few classes over the years but in the months before I’m set to graduate and move away to a different state, we started talking more. Then we had a few in person lunch dates before I moved away.\n\nAfter I moved, we continued to talk. She was set to graduate one year behind me. I flew back into town for her graduation later that year, and then a few weeks later she had a crisis, and we decided it was best if I came to pick her up. So, I drove a few states over to pick her up in my vehicle with most of her belongings and she moved into my place just like that.\n\nWe lived in a shared house near downtown Minneapolis with around 7 other people of the same age, early 20s, which made it easy to integrate into the new city. She made friends from Thailand that were attending the University of MN. We were very into each other at this time, having sex multiple times a day and always wanting to be around each other.\n\nI worked full-time and sometimes travelled for work, when I went somewhere interesting, I would usually stay over the weekend, and she would fly out to join me. We genuinely had a good time, and I fell in love with her. She also said she loved me, and I believed her.\n\nLate 2008, and her student visa is going to expire soon. We were going to have to decide what to do. Either she had to go back home, or we had to do something. We decided to get married in the local courthouse and then apply for a fiancé K1 visa. We continued living in the same house for another year until I changed jobs and we then moved to a different state. Around this time we announced to our family and friends that we were going to get married and started all the arrangements. We applied for her K1 fiance visa. I flew to Thailand to meet her parents and family. They are a middle class family and her father owns an insurance agency.\n\nIn 2009 We had two separate wedding ceremonies, one in the US, and one in Thailand. It was a traditional Thai wedding with all the intricacies which was very fun to be involved in. After a year+ of what felt like non-stop wedding planning, we finally settled down in our new home once everything was finished. During this time we adopted a couple cats that we treated like children.\n\nThe issue of children for ourselves came up sometimes, but she was on birth control and we didn’t have plans for children any time soon. We were just enjoying our newly married lives. I continued my job that continued to involved some travel and while she was still looking for work in our new city, she would sometimes join me on my work trips which was fun for both of us.\n\nFast forward to around 2010-2011. My now wife has found a good full time job in a downtown office. She has to commute around 30 minutes each way to work Monday through Friday - this was before Zoom calls. So, we mostly saw each other briefly in the mornings and in the evenings.\n\nOne day she tells me that some of her friends from work are planning a weekend “float trip” which is kind of a camping trip by the lake. It would be in a state park around 4 hours drive from our place. She wanted to go by herself as she said it was just supposed to be her coworkers. I was like that sounds fun and I said have a good time. I trusted her 100% at this time. \n\nShortly after the float trip I noticed that she started protecting her phone more, something she never used to do. It was always with her, when before she would always leave it around and have to find it later. Sometimes asking me to call her phone so she can find it.\n\nI started getting more suspicious when she had mentioned a new friend at work. I could hardly ever reach her during work hours. She wouldn’t answer her phone and was very slow to return calls and texts. She’d arrive home later. I’d have to call her office number to see if she was still at her desk after 6pm. When she first started her job at this company downtown, I would sometimes drive up to meet her for lunch, but our lunches together seemed to stop after the time of this \"float trip\".\n\nOn the weekends, she started spending most of the time outside the house. She said she was hanging out with some friends she met at work. We started arguing more as I started asking her more questions about who this guy is when I found her phone screen with many text messages from an “LJ”. Her phone was locked, but I could still see the name. She was getting texts all the time from this person “LJ”.\n\nEventually she started spending the whole weekend away from Friday night until Sunday night. At this point I did something questionable. We had a shared laptop and I restored her iPhone backup onto my phone one of the weekends while she was away. I read her text messages and found conversations with LJ. They were cheating, but it wasn't clear if they were having sex.\n\nI was devastated but knew that if I confronted her with that now while she was outside, she would just stay outside and not come home. I waited until she returned home and then showed her some of the photos and videos that I found on her phone. One video was of her kissing LJ on the cheek while they were driving to the float trip in the car that I helped her buy. He was driving our car.\n\nAt this point, I loved her but I was absolutely devastated. Until the float trip, I thought I had a happy marriage. We seemed to love each other, we had a good sex life, we did things together on the weekends before she started hanging around her “friends from work”. My heart was broken.\n\nConfronted with the evidence in front of her eyes, I told her that I was prepared to divorce if she didn’t quit the job where she worked with LJ and agree to stay away from him. She agreed to quit her job and did so the next week. I still loved her or thought I did, so I decided to give her a second chance. This happened around two years after we had been married. She has her permanent resident / green card by this time.\n\nFast forward a couple years and I received a job offer in California. She now has a job that can easily transfer, and she’ll be able to work from home after she moves with me to California. Things are going great for us. We fly out to California a couple times to apartment shop and then decide on a place. I'm set to start my new job soon, so I'll move first and then she'll will join me. It takes her around three months to finally move, apparently because she was working on getting approval from her company to relocate. I try to put all the past infidelity with LJ out of my mind because he is now over 1600 miles away. I assume the problem is solved.\n\nOne weekend we are shopping for bicycles, we thought it would be a fun thing to do as a couple in our new city. She left her phone in my car unlocked. I looked at it and saw she had messages from LJ again. My heart stopped. I waited until she got back into the car, I told her what I just saw and said that “I thought we were going to start fresh after we moved to California”. I don’t recall what she said to answer me but the ride home was in silence. It really ruined what was an otherwise pleasant afternoon together.\n\nThe next few years are rough, we’re fighting a lot more and sometimes going without sex for months. She continued to take her birth control pills. I asked her about it one day, why she was taking them still if we never had sex. She said she needed to take them to help her skin. I was pretty sure that she was cheating but I had started drinking more to help tune it all out. That became another source of arguments, my drinking. The drinking became a problem and sometimes I was drinking 12 or more beers in a day. Most days I got into the routine of drinking in the evening, while she would be upstairs doing her thing if she was home. Not a healthy combination for a marriage. \n\nFast forward to 2017. I had left one of her metal bowls that she got from Thailand outside for the neighborhood dogs to drink as it was hot outside. She comes home to see her “special bowl” outside and we have a blow up fight about it. Enraged, she ends up throwing the bowl at me and it hit me, injuring my elbow. It drew blood. I called 911 and the police came out. She didn’t get arrested as I told them not to, but they had her leave, and she stayed in a hotel for the night. During the night she withdrew $35,000 from our joint savings account that was supposed to be used for a down payment on a home. Naturally, I demanded that she return the money, but she refused. I started talking to a divorce lawyer but for some reason decided against filing right then. I couldn’t do anything about it really, except stew. Unfortunately, I started to resent her. But I didn’t really want to go through a divorce, yet. I didn’t feel ready to go through all that hassle and expense.\n\nI thought maybe a nice vacation to Hawaii would help us get our marriage back into the groove. We book a vacation and she helps plan it, but it’s a struggle. On the vacation there was lots of arguing. We had sex a few times which was nice to know that we could still do that, but it was awkward. She just laid there. It’s not enjoyable for me if I see my partner is clearly not into it, so it was a turn off.\n\nShortly after we returned home from vacation in November 2018, I stop drinking for good. The new sober clarity finally laid bare what I had been trying to avoid by drinking - my wife was having an affair and wasn't going to end it. I wasn’t sure at that point if she was physically cheating as I had no hard evidence, but I still had strong suspicions. I couldn’t take it anymore. There was a total lack of trust. I file for divorce.\n\nShe immediately hires an attorney and asks for temporary spousal support and gets awarded it. Because we were married more than ten years and California considers our marriage long term, I was potentially on the hook for permanent alimony. She wouldn’t agree to anything at first, so I had to fight hard in court because I did not want to be paying her permanent alimony. My attorney eventually got her to agree to three years of spousal support, a five-figure amount at signing the settlement, then half of my 401k. She paid me nothing, but I got my freedom back.\n\nI shouldn’t, but recently I Googled her name and found she and “LJ” are listed as living in the same address. All that time she told me that he was nothing, just a friend. If you read down this far, thank you. And I'd be curious to know what you think about my story.\n\n  \n\\-edit-\n\nI have more stories about the deception between my ex-wife and LJ; if there's enough interest, I might spend the time to write some of them down.",

On top of all this, in the same timeframe, but she swears it was not related, she informed me she no longer wanted to pursue closing the distance in our LDR after she finished school, that it was an unfair expectation from the start that the pressure was put on her to move and have to deal with my pre-existing partner(when she pursued a deeper relationship with me by making that commitment initially). I had tried for several months to have a no bullshit conversation about the future, I knew she wasn't a big fan of my other partner and when I brought up trying to talk about it seriously she took it as my distrust of her and her commitment. \n\nI did emotional gymnastics to try to \"save the relationship\" after she disclosed those ways she betrayed our relationship, her needs, how she was flavoring up with her CPTSD triggers and that she intended to continue seeing her AP... It ultimately failed due to my request to collaborate on what a different future and relationship would look like, without demoting me to a secondary or side partner to someone she's in-person with, as too controlling again, weaponising Relationship Anarchy principles that are supposed to form ethical structures, but in this case used to strip our boundaries on a highly involved relationship,... She said she \"can't allow someone to have that much control over her other relationships\". It's valid but I am so mad because I bent over backward to try to find a way forward and to resolve after she came forward, apologized and said she wanted to continue to have a relationship with me. \n\nI thought she was the person I could build my life with, the person who could share my deepest sense of self and who'd be with me through it all, my soulmate and future spouse. I still do not think her true self would do this or ever intend to betray or hurt me, but she did. How do I get out from under the mountain of grief and the weird sense that it just temporary. It might be, but rationally it's more likely permanent, ...  I know that cannot help my healing. I'm incredibly lost on this. ",

      "selftext": "You can  read my last post for more info on this situation… \n\nAlso this isn’t AI—I use a lot of em-dashes (always have) \n\n\nMy husband recently confessed to a year-long emotional affair. He swears it was never physical, but my gut tells me that’s not the full truth. All of the texts between them have been deleted, which makes it even harder for me to process and move forward. He admitted she sent him nude photos, and he said the worst part (in his words) was that he invested emotionally in someone else instead of me. That cuts the deepest because I’ve been begging him for that kind of connection for 16 years of our marriage.\n\nHe also told me the texts were “really bad” and that if I ever read them, I’d be humiliated. That statement alone is haunting me. I feel like I’m being forced to live in the dark, knowing there’s a version of events out there that I’ll never see. Not being able to read the texts myself is driving me insane.\n\nSomething else that makes this worse is my husband’s personality—he’s an all or nothing person. He either does things 100% or not at all, and his love language is physical touch. For him to consciously decide to have an affair and risk our marriage and family, it’s hard for me to believe he would stop at just talking and exchanging nude photos. I know how he operates: if he steps out, he’s “all in.” It wouldn’t be worth it to him for just a few racy texts. That’s why it’s so hard for me to accept that this was “just” emotional.\n\nI’ve told him I cannot do this if he continues to withhold. I’ve said, “I’m not asking for bits and pieces of the truth. I’m demanding every single detail of this affair. Without that, I cannot heal, I cannot trust, and I cannot even consider reconciliation.” But even after that, all I have is his word—and for the last 18 months, his words haven’t matched reality.\n\nAt first, he forbid me to contact her, saying it would just “open a can of worms” and make me look pathetic and crazy. To me, that felt like he was still protecting himself and maybe her too. Eventually, he told me I could contact her if I wanted—but now I feel paralyzed. I don’t know if reaching out would actually give me the truth or if it would just create more damage.\n\nI’m stuck between desperately needing answers and fearing that contacting her will only make things worse. Has anyone here ever contacted the affair partner? Was it worth it, or did it only bring more pain? Would you recommend doing it, or advise against it?\n\nI’d at the very least like to let her know how he has framed the entire thing like she was obsessed with him and he felt like he had to continue the relationship with her out of fear. She should at least know the things he said behind her back right? She is like 16 years younger than us and he told me she was like a daughter to him. It’s sick. Will she even care? Maybe if I frame it in the right way she will want to defend herself against the lies he is telling? ",

She told me that and if I’m honest, I didn’t cry or scream I just sat there. I’ve kinda know I feel like? And I always thought I would get angry but no. I just looked at the ground. She had BPD (borderline personality disorder.) and at that time was not taking her meds because she said she felt better. (I would tell her that’s not how they work.) she also stopped going to therapy. My main thing is what do I do? Because sadly? I still love her. Can you get past cheating? This woman was with me when my father passed and helped me through it. Held me when I cried and honestly other than the cheating has been a perfect girlfriend. And when I say cheating I mean actually sleeping with someone else. She made it clear they never were in our home. But still, it kinda hurts, but also? I really don’t feel to much about it and I’m wondering if it will hit me later.",

I would read their love story giggling and kicking my feet while reliving mine and my husbands first meeting, first kiss, having sex for the first time and so on.\n\nI still read other genres but the second there's any romance from the main character, I just can't do it. My favourite romance authors are releasing new books and continuing series I've loved and half of me desperately want to read them while the other is knocked sick at the thought. It's not just in media either. I spent my sister's wedding last week on the edge of tears as I heard them make all the vows we did. I felt so bitter.\n\nI hate everything about this but God, I hate what its taken from me.\n\nEdit: I can see in my notifications people have commented but when I click onto the post I can't see any, even the automod comment.

It turned out disastrous. His ex (separated for almost a year) had a total meltdown when she found out and that put an end to that. Honestly, he has so much healing to do. We've put boundaries in place until he's doing better and is further along with his divorce. In the 7 weeks since all of that craziness I feel like I’m hitting my stride. I’ve been journaling, working out regularly, losing weight, seeing my therapist, having fun with friends, I joined a choir, I'm enjoying my kids and pretty much loving life. Enough so that people are noticing, which is a wonderful feeling. I even got my first tattoo!\nI saw my lawyer yesterday and we went through EX's discovery. It turns out that there was a hotel room paid for with our credit card, a fertility appointment which I'm guessing was to make sure his swimmers weren't swimming for the AP, and years of secret Only Fans charges. Good grief. I have no lingering feelings for that loser. \nMy middle child (16) is really struggling with the custody arrangement right now. I'm hoping with the next steps of the divorce that they will be given a say in where they would like to live rather than the 50/50 were doing now. Finances continue to be a concern for me. I'm currently looking for a second job or something I can do to supplement my income. If anyone has ideas, send them my way.\nSo here's to the next chapter of my life and to moving forward. Right now I'm riding this wave and taking care of myself. It does get better.",

      "title": "Reconciliation is not for everyone",
      "selftext": "I know some people have hopes with reconciling with their wayward partners. I want to share my own unsuccessful reconciliation story that lasted one year. (This is not to dampen the hopes of others considering R.)\n\nI had hope with my ex-partner after D-Day1. I gave him another chance because I still loved him with all my heart, and I was seriously dependent on him. I believed he was sincerely remorseful of his actions after he betrayed me. He even seemed to show this remorse. After a long talk with him, it’s like he became a different person. Determined to change. Determined to own up to his mistake. \n\nHe became much more reassuring, caring and loving in the first two months of reconciliation. He shared his location with me, and made sure he always told me what he was doing and for how long. To me, the anxious and betrayed, I was so happy and grateful. But that didn’t magically fix the trust that was broken. I was still anxious, paranoid, and hypervigilant. He wasn’t perfectly consistent either, sometimes he’d forget to tell me he was going to be doing something important, sometimes he’d fall asleep without saying anything and that would send my nervous system into a panic. I was so scared he would be cheating again while he was absent so I’d spam call him. \n\nWe talked for hours and hours on end, about the nature of reconciliation and what needed to be done. We talked about the length of our healing journey, which I already knew would be long. I even asked him, “Will you be okay staying with me for the years I’ll be recovering?” He agreed, promising he would stay no matter how long it took, or how hard it was. At that moment, I was so relieved. It made me happy that he would be willing to do so much for me. \n\nThat phase lasted about a few months or so before slowly he started to become impatient. Even though he was still “trying his best” to reassure me, even after a lot of screw-ups on his end, I still haven’t trusted him. I was still riddled with anxiety and paranoia. Within those months, I even developed codependency behaviours towards him. I couldn’t go an hour without seeing him, which was both destroying our mental health. He was naturally an avoidant, so this change has been extremely hard on him and so he begins to describe it to me as “hurting him.” My anxiety, my paranoia, my insecurity, all issues he caused by cheating on me… was hurting him. \n\nAfraid he’ll leave, I desperately promised him to “change” myself to be less anxious and clingy all the time. He told me we both needed to put in effort, in which I agreed, but he stressed it should be an equal effort which I disagreed upon. I argued that the initial problem was caused by him, and it wasn’t my fault I was acting this way, therefore I shouldn’t be putting the same effort as him. He should be the one putting more effort into helping me feel secure again. \n\nBy this point, I was beginning to feel drained, because why was he turning this entire problem onto me? He also had this horrible victim complex which led him to attempt to blame me for being affected by his betrayal and not healing as fast as he wanted me to. In other words, he wanted me to get over it as soon as possible, while reframing this into the fact he did not want me to suffer for so long. I was livid, in which he begrudgingly apologized to me for his words and promised he would’nt blame me again. \n\nMore months passed, and I put in effort in trying to manage my emotions (I am diagnosed with BPD), my codependency and my anxiety. But it was still evident since I will “relapse” and start displaying behaviour which he described as “clingy and too much”. I would get upset at him for leaving me behind or purposely ignoring me, in which he would get upset as well, telling me I was too sensitive. This was the point I felt where reconciliation was becoming a pipe dream because my ex-partner has actually gotten tired of tending to my every need (which is mainly reassurance), the very thing that he promised he’d do for me. Slowly, he became resentful and yelled at me. His behaviour slowly turned into verbal abuse, and he just wouldn’t stop victimizing himself, telling me how much I hurt him with this type of behaviour. The final straw for me? When he told me I was getting in the way of his life.\n\nI was angry and upset, and kept questioning my self worth. Was I too much? Was I demanding too much? But if I don’t demand this much, I’ll never feel safe with this person… and it became a dilemma for both of us. Either he sucks it up and continues tending to my insecure behaviour or I stop asking for it and remain in anxiety for the rest of my life. It was a hard decision. I twisted myself for my ex-partner, forcing myself to stop asking and being “too much” for him. But I relapse, my anxiety takes over and I become an anxious mess.\n\nIn the end, he couldn’t bear it. Out of desperation for him to not leave, I once again promised him I would stop these behaviours of mine. But I relapsed and he lost it, screaming at me for “breaking my promise.” He said horrible words and dumped me, and while in the process of dumping me I soon realize he had been talking to another woman behind my back a week before he dumped me, exactly when our major argument happened. This is what exactly pushed him to commit D-Day 1, and now the same thing happened with D-Day 2. This man would run to the comfort of others, believing I was hurting him. \n\nI cannot believe that I tolerated him for a year. My reconciliation journey had been nothing but me begging him to change, sitting in anxiety because he was inconsistent, and ultimately him blaming me for behaviours he caused. Reconciliation is definitely not for everyone. I believe it is possible, but only if the wayward partner is able to take accountability for their own actions, very consistent, willing to make the necessary sacrifices, and very patient with the betrayed. Not every wayward partner is capable of reconciliation, even if the betrayed gives them a chance. I’m beyond heartbroken that he decided to give up on me, and in the process even blame me for it. Despite everything, I saw a future with this man. But it turns out he gave up a long time ago. \n\nThanks for reading if you made it this far. (I’m so sorry this is so long)\n",

      "selftext": "My wife’s affairs were all online, but they went far beyond just emotional.\n\nThe first started in January 2023 with a colleague. They messaged constantly until May. It never turned physical, but I knew if they had the chance, it would have. Later that year she lost her job and fell into depression. I worked full-time, handled the kids, the house, the meals, everything while she mostly slept on the couch. Counseling went nowhere. By the end of 2023, I told her I was still hurting, and I was starting to resent how checked out she was.\n\nNot long after, she secretly reached back out to that first affair partner, telling him she still had feelings. He rejected her, harshly. She told me later. At the time, though, I just noticed she suddenly seemed more motivated, helping around the house, acting engaged again. I thought she was finally trying. Really, it was just the sting of rejection snapping her out of the fog.\n\nBy March 2024 she landed a new job. Days later, she blindsided me: “I don’t want to be with you anymore.” She said she’d look for a new place but never did, and eventually, we reconciled. From May until early 2025, life actually felt good again. For the first time in years, I thought we were on solid ground.\n\nThen, January 2025. I pushed for us to get serious about therapy. Suddenly she was distant, paranoid. When I asked why, she flipped it on me…. crying, screaming that I was going to leave her*.* That’s when the truth came out: from October to January, she had been in an online BDSM affair…pictures, virtual “sessions,” the works.\n\nBut that wasn’t all. I learned she had actually started talking to three men in a BDSM chatroom back in March 2024, right around the time she tried to leave me. One of those men became the affair partner she reconnected with months later. She did stop talking to him in April  but only because he insulted her (called her a dog) and started ignoring her. She eventually picked up the affair in October 24, lasting until January 25. They even planned to have a virtual session during a work trip this past January. When I asked if she would have gone physical, she insisted “of course not.” But eventually, she admitted she couldn’t be sure.\n\nThe only reason the affair ended was because she “finally saw me again” after I told her we really needed to work things out. I don’t believe this was just it, I’m sure something happened between the two of them to get there.\n\nWe tried therapy again, but it turned into expensive homework sessions I took seriously and she didn’t. After thousands spent with no progress, I stopped going. She says she still wants to make it work, but I’m stuck. Stuck with the lies, the gaslighting, the knowledge that she only turned to me when others turned her away.\n\nEight months since D-Day, and I’m left wondering: am I holding on to the past… or just facing the truth of who she is? And the hardest part, some of what I’ve written here, I’ve only just recently found out. The lies keep trickling in, long after I thought I already knew everything. She is writing everything out for me, so I can have the official true story. I don’t know if that’s crazy or not, but I think I would appreciate the truth, if it is true that is. ",

Writing this feels like part of my healing too.\n\n**Context:**  \nAbout 6 months ago, I found out my ex (7 years together) had betrayed me emotionally and physically while still being in the relationship. It was the most painful experience of my life: lies, gaslighting, her telling me I wasn’t “masculine enough” or “attractive enough”.\n\nThe first months of no contact were hell. I was drowning in pain, ruminating, barely able to work or sleep. Slowly, I started rebuilding: I hit the gym, reconnected with my friends and family, took a trip to Japan that reminded me who I was before her. I even started dating again, went on a few dates, and had a casual sexual encounter, it was a big milestone for me, because for months I felt undesirable and broken.\n\nFor the last few weeks, I was actually doing better. I wasn’t waking up thinking about her, I wasn’t wondering what she was doing, I felt more calm and even excited about my future.\n\nAnd then the email came.  \nOut of nowhere, breaking no contact I had fought so hard to maintain (I blocked her on everything or so I thought), she sent me this:\n\n>*Hi OP,*\n\n>I hope I’m not bothering you too much with this letter, but I need to say I’m sorry.\n\n>You were always enough. You meant the world to me. Thanks to you I was able to grow, mature, understand myself a little better, understand others. With you I was happy, really happy.\n\n>I want you to know that I recognize my responsibility. I fucked up. I hurt you and acted impulsively and immaturely. I’m not here to ask you for anything, not even your forgiveness. I just want to acknowledge how much I messed up, that I hurt you, and that I didn’t have the maturity to manage my emotions better. I still don’t have all the answers, I have a lot of work to do on myself.\n\n>Right now I’m struggling with a deep depression, with the help of a psychiatrist and medication, but I want to get to the other side and truly grow.\n\n>Again, I’m so sorry. I deeply regret my actions, how I handled things, being immature and weak. I gave up when I should have fought by your side, I should have chosen our relationship, but I let fear, insecurity and empty impulses dominate me.\n\n>I’m not looking for excuses, just to say I'm sorry and thank you for all the years in which you made me happy, feel loved and accompanied.\n\n>I also want to apologize for telling you I wanted you to be “more masculine.” That was unfair and hurtful of me. You are a wonderful person exactly as you are. Nobody is perfect, but you were always incredible and very special.\n\n>I hope with all my heart that things are going well for you, that you’re happy and that you feel supported by the people who love you.\n\n>I love you and I will always love you.\n\nAt first, it triggered everything I had already processed: the nostalgia, the longing, the sadness. I woke up crying at night again, sleeping all day, feeling like I was back at the beginning. It made me miss her even though I know she manipulated me, gaslit me, and caused pain not only to me but also to my family and friends.\n\nIt also pissed me off. She never says *“I betrayed you.”* She frames it as being “weak” or having “made mistakes,” as if it wasn’t conscious decisions that destroyed me. She talks about *her* depression, *her* guilt, but doesn’t mention the concrete ways she hurt me, the manipulation, or the devastation she caused around me.\n\nAnd most of all, it broke my boundary: she knew I didn’t want to read the apology letter because I refused last time she tried, and she still forced her words into my life.\n\nI know I can’t respond. Breaking no contact again would only hurt me. But right now, I’m angry, sad, and exhausted. I just needed to share this with people who get it and hear your thoughts about it.\n\nEDIT: Thank you so much for all your messages, I've been reading them all a few times. You were right, I decided to ignore it completly, block her on gmail and go back to my routine, and I'm already feeling so much better. This has also help me realize how far along the way I am and how strong I've become. Again, thank you all for your support.",

He had cheated before by talking to people online but he said nothing physical ever happened and I truly believed him. \n\nUntil I started getting weird symptoms. Went to the doctor who confirmed I had chlamydia. He swears up and down he must have had it the whole time we were together and even tried to convince me by saying he thought he had symptoms but ignored them because he was embarrassed (?) I told him I got a full panel done a year and a half after we had been together and that was negative. He absolutely caught it between year 1.5 and year 5 but he will not drop the act. He still will not tell me who he cheated on me with to get it. He is still trying to pass off that even though he is a compulsive habitual liar he is telling the truth about this and just also happens to be a one of a kind medical marvel as he is claming he had a dormant untransmittable version of chlamydia but that it also gave him noticeable symptoms that he ignored. I just want to know who it was it is driving me crazy.\n\nI feel like im going insane i am so triggered every single day. We have not slept together in months because I freak out every time that he's going to give me another worse STD. I *need* to feel safe and respected to be able to open up like that and its like he slammed that door shut and dead bolted it with his actions. \n\nI know he is still lying about so so much. He lies about things just because its easier not even because he gets anything out of it. \n\nI miss the relationship we had before, when i thought i was cherished and adored and respected. I know I can't go back but i don't know how to go forward. ",

      "title": "Shithead affair partner is now a part of my kids' lives. Help.",
      "selftext": "About a year ago my marriage ended after I found out my wife of 13 years was having an affair. It was really awful and traumatic. She gaslighted me about it for close to half a year after I became suspicious (disgusting levels of manipulation), then once I finally caught her that abruptly ended our relationship without any accountability from her. She just moved on to a new life and refuses to address any of it. She basically just pretends like none of it ever happened which for a long time really messed with me. She even blamed me for how our kids were hurt by our separation because I wasn't ready to act like everything was fine between us and do shared events. She's a mess and simply can't own her shit. I've definitely been left with some serious trauma over all of it, but I've come a long way over the last year and have mostly made peace with the situation. I am no longer missing her (at least who she has become) and can see her for the broken woman that she is. We share 2 kids (3 and 5) and while co-parenting has been a challenge, it's gotten easier since finalizing our divorce and I've mostly gotten used to having to be in communication with her fairly regularly.\n\nAll of that progress of feeling better went out the window this last week when I heard from my daughter that my ex had introduced my kids to the affair partner. I felt like I was going to be sick. I always knew this was a possibility and I had been dreading it all year but mostly trying not to think about it. I didn't even know if they were still together but I guess he's still around. My ex only tells the kids he's \"mommy's friend\" and assures them he's not her boyfriend for some reason even though he's staying over at her apartment overnight for days at a time. I was really hoping to never have to hear my kids speak the name of their homewrecker but suddenly I'm having to hear stories about mommy's cool new friend and how he drives really fast and gives good piggy back rides. I didn't even get to prepare myself for this news because she neglected to tell me they would be meeting him even though we agreed in our parenting plan that we would inform the other parent of any new partners being introduced. I had to hear it from my kid. I don't understand it. I don't understand her. Aside from the pain of having to hear that this guy who helped ruin my family is now essentially replacing me half the time, I have serious questions about his character (beyond just the fact that he sleeps with married women). He was her ex boyfriend from when she was 20 and I only ever heard bad stories. He went to jail for months for assaulting his own dad. He's an alcoholic. He's obsessed with guns. He has no car of his own yet drives my kids around wildly in my ex's car. Obviously this is not a guy I want in my kids' life.\n\nIf that weren't bad enough he got my ex wife pregnant when they were together back when she was 20 (16 years ago), and she terminated the pregnancy and dumped him without ever telling him about the abortion. She just left him abruptly. She never told me this insane red flag of a story until the final month of our 13 year relationship, the story was always that he was abusive so she had to leave. After she left him she went back to school and met me, we got married, had kids, bought a house, the whole thing. This guy doesn't have any kids of his own and my ex wife's tubes are now tied. He now knows about the abortion. I feel as though the guy has more reason than any other man on earth to resent my children. She aborted his kid, dumped him, had two of mine, then he's going to come in and maybe be a step dad to my kids while having none of his own? I can't imagine feeling great about that if I were him. What do I do about this nightmare? I know I have no say in any of what she does but it's so hard to accept that this guy is going to be an influence in my kids' lives. Anyone who's gone through anything like this (or even if you haven't) I'd love to hear what you think. This is so hard.",

A few months after that we are in the club and we see the what is now her fiancé. The fiancé is a woman and so am I. I found out she’s been stalking this girl since 2018, 3 years before I met her.

      "selftext": "I've been meaning to post here for a while, but every time I've tried to write this out it's come out as incoherent rambling. It may still have a bit of that, but ill try to summarize as best I can.\n\nAbout 2 months ago I caught him cheating. Coworker(s), because duh. Since then I've found out more things he's done or said. It just keeps getting worse. We've been together 10 years and we have 2 small kids together. He caught me off guard with the cheating, but what was more surprising and painful was everything that happened after. He got mad at ME. He hates ME. He moved on immediately. I mean literally the next day. He let her meet my kids and told them to lie to me about it. 4 single days after I caught him and dumped him. He would watch me sob and have an anxiety attack and beg him to stop being so mean, then call be a psycho B and tell me that this is why he didnt want to be with me, and then go leave to bang his new girl. He has just been so cold. No indication that he's even a tiny bit upset. In the last couple months there have been a few decent conversations, and there have been days or moments where hes relatively kind, but over all its either he ignores me entirely or is cruel.\n\nOur relationship wasn't perfect by any means, but I always thought that at the very least there was a level of love and respect towards each other. Us splitting up honestly isn't that shocking. Even the cheating wasn't entirely out of the realm of a possibility. Never in a million years could I have seen him being like this to me. We've been \"living together\" since I caught him, but he's hardly here and when he is he just sits in his car until like 11pm. The kids miss him. They ask me where he is or why he won't come inside, and I don't know what to tell them. He screwed me over, and then completely abandoned all of us and left me to deal with everything. \n\nSo I've spent about 2 months being mostly angry or anxious. I've kept myself busy with childcare and apartment hunting and packing and stuff. All I can feel tonight is just sadness. My kids are with grandparents and I'm loading up the uhaul and just crying. This is the house I've been living in for 7 years. This is where my kids took their first steps and where him and I had fun painting the walls. I didn't want to break up with him. I didn't want to move out. I didn't want to be a single mom. I didn't make any of these decisions that put me here, yet I'm stuck doing everything on my own without even an ounce of support from him. I'm really going to miss this house. I love this place.\n\nI know everything I said makes him seem like a horrible, abusive man. Maybe part of him is, but it wasn't always like this and when he's good he's great. He has a drinking problem, and I guess he's been on a bit of a bender. He has a lot of issues and I've always stood by him in his hard times. He's currently \"detoxing\" on a friends couch. \"Giving me space\" or something. This is the only time during this process I've actually needed him here though and he decides to just leave. I don't get to just leave. I don't get to go on a bender and spend all my time with friends and at work. I don't get to spend the entire night out in my car listening to music. He did this, he chose this, and somehow HE is the one having a hard time right now and expecting sympathy. I was relying on him to help me move the heavy things. Now I have to figure out how to do that alone because I have nobody else to help. One last \"fuck you\" from him. \n\nI'm just really sad about all of this. I feel bad for my kids. I feel bad for myself. I chose the wrong man but I really thought he was good for a long time. I had a shitty dad and it was really important for me to raise my kids in a healthy home with both parents. If we had to separate, it was important for me to show them that we still love and respect each other. None of that is happening. I really loved him despite the flaws and I always supported him and was kind. I'm back and forth between rage and complete devastation tonight. The logic side of my brain knows it's the right decision and that I will be fine eventually, but the emotional half is so much louder.\n\nI guess I'm not here for anything specific. I just really needed to get this out. I hate this so much. I feel like I did everything right. I feel so stupid for spending a decade with him and not seeing who he was. I feel dumb for ignoring or forgiving all the other awful things he's done or said. I'm devastated for our little girls and I honestly try to just not think about that part right now. \n\nSorry this did turn out a little rambly. If you read through than thank you. Wish me luck \n\n",

      "selftext": "Where to begin. I (39M) and my wife (42F) have been married 17 years. We were married 2 years to the day that we met. We hit it off quickly. Our meeting story is a good one (she yelled at me). This was the first time I had ever asked a girl out the day I met her. We had a great first date. She even invited me back to her apartment and we watched a movie. No intimacy beyond me kissing her goodnight (I was actually a virgin). Two days later we were on our second date. I spent the next 6 weeks seeing her 3-5 days a week, whether it was for a quick lunch, simple dinner, hanging out watching TV, or actual dates. When I couldn’t see her, I called her. It seemed perfect. At the time I had just finished my freshmen year of college, and she had already graduated and was working full time there in town. Still no full intimacy at this point, but we were very close (she offered but I wasn’t ready). I had a summer job as a camp counselor and had to leave for the next 7 weeks to go work at the camp. I called her almost every night. I tried to figure out a way to see her over the summer but could never work it out. I still called her constantly and talked about us being able to get back together. I was giving her to full boyfriend treatment. She was giving me the full girlfriend treatment. \n\nWhen I got back at the end of the summer, we jumped right back into our old habits of seeing each other constantly. In October I had to leave school over money problems and went back home. In December I proposed and she accepted. We continued our long-distance relationship until June of the next year when she moved to me. We saw each other every other weekend and talked nightly. When she moved down, we all but moved in together. Life was good. Like I said, we married 2 years to the day that we met, and basically when we began our relationship. We have 2 kids (14 and 11). Our marriage has had its ups and downs, but we’ve always stuck together. She is my one and only.\n\nShe has had a lot of health problems. They have really affected her, and I have stood by her even when these problems have negatively impacted our marriage. When I have told friends about her health problems (both mental and physical) they often seem surprised it affects her so much as they are not crazy problems. I’ve had a lot of people reply she needs to buckle down and push through. I have always defended her in these situations. These problems have had ups and downs, but the last 5 years have been really rough. I’d say out of 17 years of marriage we’ve had 10 years where the medical issues have negatively impacted her. Around 2 years ago I started feeling neglected. She had given up on life in a lot of ways, and I was always the last priority to her (or at least that’s what I perceived). \n\nThis year it really began to impact me. I thought she didn’t want me anymore. I kept quiet because I attributed it to her health issues and I’m not that guy who is going to abandon her just because I’m not getting what I need when she had what I believed to be real problems. It festered, and I began to question a lot of things such as did I make a mistake marrying the first girl out of high school/first girl I slept with. I felt like my marriage was changing forever and that I had missed out getting married so young. I finally broke down and told her how I felt. She, at the time, was very understanding and assured me she still wanted me and was attracted to me. I started putting more effort into me, trying to be more attractive to her. We had some good days over those next couple of weeks.\n\nHere is where the problem comes in. From the get-go she lied about her past with men. She told me she had only been with one guy, and I was stupid and believed her. Multiple guys were reaching out to her, even after we were engaged (part of our engagement was a long-distance relationship). She got STD tests during our early relationship even though she and I weren’t having sex. As the years went on, I learned more about her past as she let certain things slip. I questioned her on if she was sleeping with guys when we first started dating/when I was at camp, but she told me know. I later learned her true (at least I must take her word for it) body count. It didn’t bother me (other than the fact that she lied) because that was before me. However, little things kept coming out (like the guy she kept going back to “before” me was still friends on Facebook with her and reached out even after we’d been married over 10 years. I told her to unfriend him, and she did it, but hesitantly). \n\nThe last thing that came out before D-day was the guy she said was always wanting to date her, even after we got together, was someone she’d actually slept with. She’d always said she couldn’t stand him and turned him down, but because I was feeling so down and questioning the past all the little hints I’d missed over 19 years started coming to my mind and I couldn’t stop myself from asking. \n\nFast forward to D-day (a couple of weeks after I told her I was feeling neglected). My suspicion was really strong that she was sleeping around on me while I was at the camp, but I didn’t want to believe it. I’d asked her years earlier and she told me know. She’d had a couple of drinks, I was in my head, and I asked her. She confirmed she’d been sleeping with other guys (plural) while I was at camp (and maybe even before when I was still in town). I was absolutely devastated. She seemed surprised I was mad. She then hit me with “we weren’t together during that time”, so she didn’t think it was cheating. She also hit me with she didn’t know how I felt about us which was why she didn’t think we were together. I was shocked because I thought it was clear. I assured her I still loved her, and we had a long talk. She told me it stopped over the summer before I got back after she realized (from one of our phone conversations) how I felt. The next day she called me at work because she knew I was upset and asked if I wanted to separate. I told her no, I thought I could live with this because it was so long ago.\n\nThe last 2 months have been a struggle. All of this has made me distant and cold. I can’t stop thinking about it. She told me she wished she’d never told me and that if it wasn’t for the fact she’d had some drinks she would have lied to me again. She’s asked me multiple times if I wanted to separate and then starts crying and telling me she can’t live without me. She has told me she is afraid to ever tell me anything again because of how this has affected me. And here’s the most messed up part. She’s mad I’m not over it. She has on a few occasions fussed at me for how I’ve made her feel, that I’ve broken her and I don’t seem like her husband anymore. \n\nShe acknowledged I’m hurting but expects me to push on. She makes it about what I’m doing to her, not what she’s done to me when she gets upset. Other times she says she deserves it because she hurt me but always reverts to what it has done to her. It’s like I’m supposed to be perfectly fine with it because, as she again said, we weren’t together. I try to put a brave face on, focus on the good times and try to make good times now, but man is it hard.\n\nI feel hurt, betrayed, and angry constantly, especially when I’m alone. Whether she thinks it, I feel like she cheated, or that she led me on because she liked the attention but wasn’t ready for a relationship. I feel lied to, and that I ended up in a marriage that was founded on a lie. A lie she would have kept until the end. I feel like I should never have married her. She was hurt that I said if I knew back then I’d have broken up with her. Hell, if I’d known 10 years ago I’d have left. I also don’t know what else she may be hiding because she thinks I’d leave. The kids are the biggest reason I haven’t left. I also don’t want to throw away 17 years of marriage because I still love and care about her, but it is a struggle.\n\nI’m in therapy, but the therapist isn’t helping much. I try and reframe things like he tells me to, but I end up angry again. I haven’t expressed this to her. She accused me of being afraid to move on, but what I’m afraid of is losing my temper (I’ve never done that with her, ever) and saying hurtful things because I’m so angry at her. I’m angry at her for what she did and how she turns it around on me. I think about leaving but then fold up when she confronts my distance (usually talking about how it hurts her and she doesn’t know what she’d do if I was gone). I don’t want to ruin my family (especially the kids), but I don’t know how long it will take me to learn to live with this and if she’ll give me that time. Every day is a struggle. I guess I needed to get this out because I have nowhere else to get it out.\n\nThanks for listening.",

      "selftext": "Will try to summarize as best as I can - I've never been invested enough in a relationship as I have been in this one. Never envisioned myself having kids or getting married, but I got along so well with my gf of 3 years that I was certain it was going to happen with her, and we were both on the same page. She didn't tick off any red flags for potential cheating or anything of the sort.\n\nWe had a rough patch of pretty frequent arguments and not seeing eye to eye on a lot of things. I did self reflection and found that a lot of the issues were coming from me. Things were going unbelievably well and she told me \"I was treating her like an angel\" and I was \"the love of her life\".\n\nShe got a call from a guy I'd never heard mentioned, asking to hang out, and it turns out she had been talking to him every day 3-5x on the phone and facetiming for hours, and deleting calls. I was super upset and this is what ensued:\n\n* It went from \"we got coffee once\" to her meeting up with him for coffee while at work, going to his apartment building to go on a walk but not going upstairs (we live within 15 mins of each other in a walkable city)\n* Her getting cold whenever I brought up that they have to stop talking\n* Her spending a month \"weighing if she values our relationship more or their friendship more\"\n* When she finally blocked him, she took a recording of it as proof. But the last 20 seconds were deleted and she insisted it wasn't. Turns out she cried telling him thank you for all he did for her (they had been friends for years but hardly talked since we started dating, aside from recently)\n* I asked to message this guy from her phone pretending to be her cuz she insisted it wasn't anything physical and I wanted confirmation (Insane I know but I couldn't believe what was happening and needed ANYTHING to help me). Halfway through these messages, she got extremely cold and acted like I was a stranger and essentially ran away from me\n\nI know this is all ridiculous and it's been a year since all of this happened. We're still together and she said she stopped victimizing herself and hates herself so much for what she did etc. She said she didn't see how good it was here and wants to make it better (admittedly I haven't seen anything suspicious for a year but I stopped looking)\n\nI am staying with her because I can't imagine getting into another relationship, with someone as \"safe\" as I thought my gf was, opening myself up etc and going through the same thing again. I still get along the best with her that I do out of anyone that I know but I think I'm far far too damaged and can't imagine what it would do to me if I met another girl and got cheated on again, so I'm staying. \n\nTL;DR: Got cheated on and endured some \"traumataizing\" degredation for months, now I don't want to get into another relationship because I can't trust another girl, so I'm staying in this one. Is this a mistake?",

      "selftext": "Now this is a recent memory of a minor moment at the time from back then, before the one time fling from the night club that I got her on, or that she confessed to, but during one of those girls nights out with her niece. I don't have an exact timeline, but I remember the moment. I was off that night and home watching the kids while wife and her niece went out. She came home after last call. She greets me, then says, \"I'm going to take a shower, I smell like smoke, yuck...\" She took her shower, and not once back then did anything cross my mind, why would it? I did not have that knowledge yet, or a reason for my mind to start working and flash warnings.\n\n  Now I had been to a few of those places the wife and her niece visited, they were not small smoke filled bars, both places were roomy with plenty of air flow. What's interesting, a convo her niece and I had just last year, talking about those years. She had said, \"...yeah, she would take a shower before you got home in the morning,..\" I didn't realize at that time she was covering a longer timeline, not just the one after-anniversary event. This one just happened to be on my night off watching the kids while she did whatever. Of course there is always more than just that one she told me, but I will never know the rest of those stories, like her married 40sh tech supervisor on those few training seminar trips, or those other club nights while I worked 3rd shift. I just thought how strange our memory works, even years later its putting it all together.",

I come here because I don’t have insurance and I feel it would be better than leaning on AI.\n\nMe (m39) and my long term partner (f37) have lived in Hawaii the last 8 years. She was always a very trustworthy and up front partner. We have been going through a rough patch the last year or so, but recently I thought we had both been working really hard to improve our relationship.\n\nWell, in August I visited my family in Missouri (we are both from Missouri) for a month. 3 weeks in, odd behavior started occurring. She began turning her phone off at night, which has never happened. We’ve always been extremely communicative. I caught her in a lie the next day and the gig was up. She admitted that she had another man in the house. I had met the man before. He went to physical therapy school with her and they had a flirty relationship at the beginning of our relationship. I found an extremely grotesque snap from him on her phone about a month into dating her. But she handled it so well: blocked him, let me have total access to her phone, deleted snap, etc, and it was so early on that over the years I totally accepted and forgot about it. But obviously that connection reignited at some point, I believe in January. The man is married, and left his wife in February of this year.\n\nAnyways, I flew back. We reconciled somewhat, but she said she needed space. So I left back to Missouri last week and am here now. She is in our home in Hawaii. When I left, we both discussed and agreed to keep talking. I was deathly afraid of being ghosted again like she did when he was there. Well, she is not ghosting me, but she is barely talking to me. A couple short texts per day. She is still talking to this guy too. He lives in Florida. She says they did not do anything, but I find that very hard to believe. When I flew home after finding out, she flew with him to a different island, and they stayed in a one bed hotel room together while I was in our home alone for four days. She had hidden all my stuff in the home as well.\n\nShe says that I’m not giving her space now, and that she doesn’t want to continue talking. I am so very afraid to lose contact with her. I don’t know what else to say, I just need some words of encouragement I guess. Tips to getting her to stay in my life maybe. I love her and miss her dearly. I am massively depressed. Especially when she won’t talk to me. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",

We have 2 children together (7 and 4). \nI have significant childhood trauma that I still deal with. I have trauma based mental health disorders. They have been well controlled and I’ve taken steps to heal myself from these traumas in the last 2-3 years.\nFive and a half years ago, I had a brief affair. My husband found out relatively quickly. Covid shut it down hard. Hubby was obviously devastated. I blacked a lot of the aftermath out in my head and was not in a space to heal from it, I also did not give him space to heal. We basically brushed it under the rug. \nWe had our second child and I got put on meds. I have been very happy and am deeply in love with my husband - I still battle with the fact that I hurt him so badly every day. It had gotten easier for me but still popped into my head daily. \nHe has struggled more than me. He bottled it up as I had a pattern of toxic reactions when he would talk about it. The shame and guilt consumed me. I am able to talk about it and am currently in a place where I can hear his feelings about it without shutting down.\nAt the end of August, he told me he was struggling because he felt like we were stuck in a pattern and he was waiting for me to step out again. He was projecting because he was already there. I found out about her a week later, then the next day we were in the hospital for 2 days because our son had emergency surgery. \nI am not angry with him. He felt disconnected. He found connection with someone else. I am still very much in love with him, this has made me love and appreciate him more. I can forgive him for this (I think I already have to an extent). \n\nHe wants to choose her. He is willing to throw away almost 14 years for her. She is also in a struggling marriage although much worse off than ours. She’s also 16 years older than us (literally his mom’s age). Her husband is possessive but does not love her. I want more than anything to fight for my marriage but my husband is not willing to. He is so deep into this affair (it is strictly emotional as of right now) that he is willing to walk out. It goes against everything he believes in, in terms of marriage and commitment and he struggles with that but he says that their connection feels like fighting a magnet and he is finding it unbearable to fight it. \n\nI cannot fathom a life where he is not with me. Not just emotionally, but he’s the bread winner and financially I could not afford to live alone. I don’t know what to do. He is staying currently but fully intends to be with her long term. I have “allowed” him to spend time with her outside of work a few times, because I’m trying to let him naturally see the grass isn’t greener. I don’t know what to do. ",

I asked him directly and he denied everything, even made me feel like I was imagining it. 2 weeks later we went on a trip together and I found out the truth — he had been messaging another woman. We broke up on that trip. He told me he had never actually met her and had already stopped talking to her, and that he needed time to reflect.\n\nWe still texted a bit after the breakup. He kept apologizing, saying he wasn’t seeing anyone, and after a couple of weeks we talked things through and decided to get back together. Even so, some things didn’t add up and eventually we broke up again after a big fight. He did finally call again and saying he is prepared to admit the whole truth and we got back together again after 2 months. He still insisted her never met though. He agreed to share his location, let me check his phone, be transparent about who he was with — all to regain my trust. \n\nRecently I find out about the whole truth. I came across the girl I thought he was texting back then and I asked her. She confirmed they had dated, she did nou know he had a gf. That’s when the full story came out: he met her at an event and while still with me, went on a date, tried to kiss her. After we broke up, he kept texting, invited her to his place multiple times, and they slept together. All the while he was still messaging me, reassuring me he wasn’t seeing anyone else. Two days after his last meeting with her, he broke up with her saying she was too young and not a good match — and the very same day he contacted me to get back together.\n\nWhen confronted, he said he lied because he didn’t want to lose me, that he was depressed due to his work, his dad being sick, etc but he could not bear to leave me, and that meeting her was like an escape. He insists he’s been doing everything he can since then to rebuild trust. He said he is willing to do the efforts again and even suggested couples counselling.\n\nNow I’m here feeling completely torn. On one hand, I do see that he’s made real efforts— sharing location, being open, trying to repair things. On the other hand, I feel so betrayed and hurt since he hid so big all the efforts seem pointless. I’ve asked for some time apart to figure out what I want.\n\nI would like any advice and insight from people here, both who had been betrayed and those who betrayed. I feel so lost.",

      "selftext": "So yesterday evening, in a fit of some new found spiritual need to confess, my wife of 2 years told me that she cheated on me while we were engaged and living in different states. Allegedly she got drunk and was texting someone and it ended up with sex. I have had issues with the number of guys she keeps contact with because she has a history of cheating but swore she saw the error or her ways since she was diagnosed with a personality disorder. She had done counseling in the past and has been on some meds but I doubt they do much of anything at this point. \n\nTo say our marriage has been good at any time since the actual event would be a lie. She has threatened to leave and go back to our home state since she arrived. Slowly over that time, I've really pretty much given up. She has admitted she doesn't love me. She's basically staying because at our age, mid-50s, she doesn't want to start again. She has stayed at home since she got here because her anxiety is bad and she won't drive so I work to support us both. Not a big deal since I make good money. Downside is, I basically have a dependent roommate now who openly acts like she doesn't like me most days. \n\nI'm not sure why she waited so long to tell me. It just feels like spite at this point. I don't want to be with her anymore. There is no peace in our home and she makes no attempted to try to make anything work. I have offered her 10s of thousands of dollars from my 401k to just leave but all she does is threaten to do so. It's like she craves the drama and pain she causes. I've gotten to the point where I just don't say anything anymore. I'm tired all the time. I am completely empty inside- I feel nothing, ever. I just want the peace back that I had before she came into my life. Life has been nothing but chaos and drama since she arrived. \n\nSo, I have been getting all the usual. Blame shifting, incomplete story, pushing me to know what I want to do. She didn't actually say she was sorry until I asked if she had- I had just kinda spaced a bit of her story. I don't think she's sorry at all. I think she had some sort of religious based guilt and that's the only reason why she decided to say anything now. She said as much during her ;confession' . She told me that I don't know the guy that it was and that they are no longer speaking. I don't believe her. It is most like one of 5-6 guys that I've had issues with her chatting with. She keeps old BFs and such as friends on FB. I told her this was an issue but she always gaslit me about it. \n\nI just wish that she would leave. But, I know that I am her retirement plan at this point. Otherwise, she works til she dies or maybe find some other sucker to take her on which will be a problem for her because she has a reputation and at her age, doesn't have to looks for people to disregard the crazy. \n\n  \nThoughts?",

      "selftext": "Hi all, I made a post a little over a year ago regarding my wife's infidelity. Here is the link:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/survivinginfidelity/comments/1dy73dd/how_do_i_confront_my_wife_after_finding_out_she/\n\nThe cliff notes are that my wife and I were admittedly in a very challenging place in spring 2024. Years of absent communication by both parties, compounded by the struggles with raising four young children, had taken their toll. We tried couples therapy and it did not go well. Ultimately one night when we were visiting my family that is out of town in an area where we both have friend networks, she went out and had sex with a guy that was fairly random. Knowing something was off, I pressed her on it and she admitted to sleeping with him. We had many difficult conversations about whether our marriage could be saved, and ultimately we agreed to work on it. Then a few weeks later I found out that she was still having steamy text conversations with the AP. I tried to end the marriage, until she begged me to stay and showed me that she had cut off communication with the AP and vowed to be a better partner.\n\nThere were follow up questions on the original post asking how we were doing that went unanswered. But the answer is (spoiler alert: was) that there were no noteworthy updates. Our communication improved and we emotionally reinvested and reconnected. In fact, in many ways it was probably our best year since early in our relationship/marriage. I'd be lying if I said things were perfect, particularly physically where I have PE struggles, but we were having sex more often than we had been in previous years (admittedly a low bar) and we spent a lot of time talking, cuddling, enjoying each other's company. Financial struggles didn't completely go away, but they were slightly alleviated by myself securing a fairly big increase, and she got a new job in her original field prior to us having kids. Again, things weren't perfect. Her job is fully on site which puts a lot more of the household management on myself, in addition to me continuing to be the sole payer of our significant family bills. But by all appearances, things seemed to be trending in a better direction.\n\nThat is until about a month ago. As she had just started her new job, I took the kids to visit my family for a week and I began to sense distance between us on that trip. When I got home, she told me that she was unhappy and that she wanted to separate. This absolutely blindsided and devastated me, given that we were so much more emotionally connected. Her initial reasons were that I hadn't taken care of myself or followed through on changes such as seeing a therapist, going to the gym (mind you she has not worked out either), and ultimately after a few conversations it became clear that sex was the biggest issue, specifically PE and me not getting her to completion.\n\nWell, my first thought was what happened while I was gone. She insisted there was nothing, and I analyzed camera footage and as far as I could tell there were no transgressions. She also was not hiding her phone, which was a trademark move last summer. After a bad couples therapy session where she got laid into by our therapist about not communicating these issues more fully and our therapist pushing us to begin taking \"next steps\" towards separation, we agreed to stop seeing our couples therapist but to continue to talk and take things day by day.\n\nThis is where there were a lot of mixed signals. Some days she talked about us being separated and she stopped wearing her wedding ring, but she also admitted to being very confused and open to us trying to work on things. After an initial period with boundaries, we started to get physical again. Things were very uncertain, but she acknowledged that there are still feelings of love. We talked and cuddled every night. I was never naive enough to think our issues had been solved, but we seemed to be in a better place even though it remained a very uncertain one given that the term separation still lingered in our conversations and symbolically, she was not wearing a wedding ring.\n\nThe dynamic changed again this weekend. She went out with friends while I was out of town, and again I sensed distance based on her not being very responsive via text. Her friends are single and she was not wearing a wedding ring. She came home that night (though it was a late night), and the following day I noticed subtle changes in her body language. Lots of time in the phone and shielding the screen somewhat. Setting her phone face down. These are things I wouldn't have thought twice about before her prior infidelity, but now they sound alarm bells.\n\nSensing something was off, I confronted her tonight and asked her what happened. She admitted to being in text conversation with a guy that she met. She said it was \"a couple harmless texts\" though based on her history I have my doubts. I told her that I want her to stop text communication, but that I can't control her so it needs to be her decision. She acknowledged that but said she would need to think about it (basically a \"no\"). I'm fairly certain nothing physical happened, though I can't be 100% confident. Even if there was nothing physical, my scars from last summer have been reopened.\n\nTo this point all of our conversations regarding our marriage have been very rational and designed to make sure we're making the right decision. I thought I wanted to save the marriage, but I'm now having doubts. I deserve better. I can't function in a relationship where I know she's seeking connections with other guys and texting random guys. Our marriage has also been a pattern of her acting out, either through infidelity or financially or logistically as I moved away from my family to be closer to hers. And every time those things have happened, she has gotten exactly what she wanted.\n\nI'm open to any suggestions on how to properly confront her in a rational yet impactful way. I also want to make sure that I'm not overreacting over texts, though I'm fairly certain I'm not.  It's also therapeutic for me to journal out these thoughts on here and I'm curious to get any feedback that anyone has within comments. More than anything I'm simply lost.",

      "selftext": "2 weeks ago,  I found screenshots of a girl in my husband’s phone. Long story short, he lied several times about the situation until finally coming clean.\n\nHe did this only 3 WEEKS after getting married.. I’m trying to figure out why.\n\nShe was a suggested friend on FB and he thought she was cute, wanted to look at her but didn’t want me to find out so he screenshotted her pictures then realized it was wrong and deleted them (not aware they backed up to his google photos)\n\nOnly a few weeks before this, we were rediscovering our sex life because we really hadn’t had one all 5 years of our relationship. He opened up about having a porn addiction that he ‘stopped’ 2 years ago.. he had told me he had one because he was abused in his past relationships sexually and porn was a way for him to get that satisfaction without being abused or made fun of his sexual performance.\n\nHe gave me all his passwords and full access to his phone and i ultimately found him watching tons of half naked girls on Facebook reels.\n\nHowever I downloaded his Facebook records and before I got to look at them and figured out the truth, the day he revealed the truth, he had googled how to stop me from getting his records and told me it’s because he wanted to ‘move on’ from the situation.\n\nHe also did this in the beginning of our relationship, watching girls on TikTok and I broke up with him over it but took him back. And yet, he’s been doing it all this time.\n\nI’m heartbroken over the whole situation. We miscarried, got married.. and this is what he does while I’ve spent the last 5 years loving him unconditionally… we’ve only been married 3 months.\n\nI gave him one chance to prove himself. He’s going to therapy, we are going to go to couples therapy, and he keeps swearing he’s going to do everything he can to rebuild what he broke and says he will never hurt me again. He’s cried several times. But I keep reading stories and TikTok’s of people saying they never change, they just get sneakier. I’m having a hard time believing he will change if he’s been doing it for so long and big life events didn’t make him grow up.\n\nI told him he had a sliver of a chance and 6 months to prove himself and make a change or I’m leaving for my own sake. He said that losing me really hit him and the thought of destroying his life all for this made him want to stop and change.\n\nI’m trying not to think about it.. the lies, what he did, all of it.. it’s just really difficult. It hangs over my head.\n\nI keep seeing her face in my head. Wondering if he finally told the truth, what if he talked to her, what if he knew her, why?\n\nI love him and want to believe everything will work out in the end and we’ll be okay but it hurts so bad and I question how someone who loves someone could do that. That thought has never crossed my mind an I couldn’t imagine it ever. \n\nIt’s hurtful and confusing. ",

      "selftext": "Together for 4 years, just found out he's been hooking up with a coworker for a year and a half, she ended up pregnant but miscarried. There was a month we broke up - we moved into separate places, etc. I'm guessing thats when it started, and it just never ended. \n\nIt's extra-painful that it's a coworker, because that's how we met. We used to work together and have all our days off together (and still liked eachother!) but I eventually switched to a dayshift position, he stayed on nights. That's when things got a lot harder, we had to really put effort into our schedules, etc., alot more fighting/disagreements, just generally not super happy and not seeing eachother...\n\nI went per diem at my job a few months back, so I've been home a lot more. All of a sudden our relationship just got so, so good (again).... just so easy. It's been really, really nice. Until I found out about all this. I saw a notification, ended up going through all his stuff - I basically saw her messaging him endlessly, paragraphs about how she feels, with very little interaction on his end. \"Ok\" \"I don't know what you want me to say\" that kind of thing. \n\nI have never been someone to put up with cheating. I have ended longer relationships over much less. But I told him if it's over, if it's really over, then we can move forward. He's not a man of many words but he confessed a lot that he didn't have to, which made me feel better. And before we had such little (physical) time together, it's almost like we weren't really together. \n\nShe's also married (but divorcing?). 40. With 3 older kids of her own. My man wants 5 children of his own... so I already know it couldn't be a long term thing. Just physical, at least on his end. \n\nI also ended up messaging her. She was strange in response but it kind of felt like closure? \n\nBut I'm still struggling. They work in the same building (different departments) and although I don't find anything in his phone/watch/email/facebook/instagram, I don't know if they see eachother or talk at work. I try to comfort myself that he always comes home to me, he literally pays all the bills (lots of OT) so I can be home to take care of the house. He hasn't changed any passwords even though I know them. He's always warm and receptive to me... it's just really, really, hard. I feel like he's my person, but when he's away I really struggle. I flip flop every day about if I should just move back home to my moms temporarily. I definitely don't feel sure enough to sign a lease. It's been a month, someone tell me it gets easier? Anyone make it through something similar? \n\nTL;DR My boyfriend cheated after months of hardly seeing eachother; I really, really want to forgive him but I'm struggling. ",

I also always did stuff like cooking cleaning etc bc it’s what I was used to doing alone, so fair to say he didn’t do much. But I never really noticed or cared bc I was always self sufficient.\n\nHowever after the baby - I couldn’t do it alone and in the beginning he wouldn’t help at all , he’d  be crying all night and he’d be sleeping in another room with the door closed for example. Which w the hormones I thought was normal bc he was working and I was not.\n\nA few months later we caught him vaping weed right before he was to drive the baby and I for a trip. Again, he’s had mental issues he’s never worked through before. I’d had considered divorce and talked with attorneys but he told me he was going to change and I wanted to believe.\n\nFast forward to a few days ago, we had gotten in a fight about his alcohol intake and he then decided to tell me he slept with escorts (reportedly before he dated me) and then cheated on me while we were apart. I had suspected this but never had evidence.\n\nI am beyond devastated. Had I known at the time I wouldn’t have stayed. It feels like he stole my life from me bc within this time I could have found someone else, married and had a child. I am so conflicted bc now it’s a matter of a baby involved. I want to divorce but I am afraid for our baby growing up with separated parents. Any advice would be appreciated!",

      "selftext": "Hey Reddit,\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: False names have been used.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*TL;DR:\\*\\* 8.5 years wasted on a coward who cheated. Caught him through YouTube searches, messages, lingerie, photos, and even videos some discovered on my birthday. He gaslit, manipulated, played the victim, and lied even in couples counselling. Kicked him out, he threatened me with defacto rights, housing related things. Now I’m healing, surrounded by love, and hopeful for a better future.\n\n\n\nThis is a long one so feel free to enjoy the ride!\n\n\n\nI (30F) was with my ex for 8.5 years. Six of those years were long distance before he finally moved from Sydney to Melbourne so we could build a life together. We even bought a house. I thought we were unshakable. Instead, he turned out to be a manipulative, gaslighting coward who betrayed me with a colleague. The beginning of the end came on 7th March. He rolled in at 4 a.m. after “celebrating with graduates at work” meanwhile, my younger brother, who was at the same event, was already home by midnight. He’d barely texted me all day, ignored my calls, and later brushed it off with excuses like, \\*“my phone battery was low”\\* and \\*“I was keeping people safe.”\\* When he finally crawled into bed, I snapped. I told him I wished I’d broken up with him 2.5 years earlier because deep down, I’d never recovered from an earlier betrayal.\n\n\n\nOn our first anniversary living together, I found a USB almost entirely full of porn of one influencer with edits so warped I couldn’t even tell if it was her body or something he’d fabricated. I never cared about porn itself; what cut deep was that he’d once brushed her off to me as “just average.” Finding those images was gutting. And when I hit a major career milestone? He didn’t even show up. This is the same man who had just quit his job to fly to Vietnam for a bucks trip, but somehow the trip from Sydney to Melbourne for me was “too much.” The cracks in our relationship weren’t just showing, they were gaping. I should mention that he didn’t celebrate my graduation and me being a keynote speaker at my workplace. \n\n\n\nHis reaction to my outburst floored me, not because it was genuine, but because it was straight out of a bad soap opera. He cried, clutched his chest like he was having a heart attack, and acted utterly shattered. The very next day, he asked for a break, saying “something in him had shifted.”\n\n\n\nMarch was hell, I blamed myself every single day. Begging for forgiveness, chasing after him, all while trying to hold it together as a bridesmaid at a wedding where he could barely look at me. He didn’t want to take pictures with me at all…that broke me even more. I begged him to try couple’s counselling, to spend time with me, to take time off work, even just to read a book on communication. He refused every single thing because drama was easier for him than actually doing the work.\n\n\n\nThen, on 24th March, my gut told me to check our shared iPad. What I found made my stomach drop: YouTube searches from 6th  March like “Should you leave her on read?” “Ways to text women,” “First kiss advice,” “How to make a girl want you”.\n\n\n\nFrom there, everything started unravelling…\n\n\n\nI messaged my younger brother who had actually gotten him his job and finally the truth spilled out. Colleagues had warned my brother that my ex was “getting close” to a 20-year-old named “Tiffany.”. He was going to tell me the day before but my ex was with me when we went over. Suddenly, all the excuses of “late trains,” “comforting a colleague,” “I need to be in office” all lined up. My sister’s boyfriend even said he’d seen someone who looked like him with a girl in the city. I completely broke down. My mum and brothers literally held me as I had a panic attack.\n\n\n\nWhen I confronted him, he followed me around the house, blocked me from leaving, and drip-fed admissions: first “nothing happened,” then “I confided in her because I had no one else, then “she held my hand outside work in front of the building,” then “I didn’t even realise she was holding my hand until we crossed the road.” Always minimising, always twisting, always deflecting. Around that time, I was also suddenly kicked off our home security system, something he brushed off claiming he “couldn’t fix it”.\n\n\n\nHis mum begged me to forgive him, saying, \\*“If he does one more thing wrong, then you can kick him out.”\\* She even asked me to make sure my mum didn’t tell anyone in the extended family just to protect their image. Meanwhile, I was drowning in evidence: lingerie he claimed he’d “bought for me” that was actually hers, a photo strip of them together (he insisted the date was wrong and that he “looked happy but wasn’t”), messages from her saying \\*“I love you,”\\* \\*“I miss you bebe,”\\* \\*“I wish you were in my bed,”\\* and eventually, videos and photos of them sleeping together. He’d tried to delete them, but I found them sitting in his Google account’s trash folder…all on my birthday. We were supposed to have dinner together that night.\n\n\n\nI’ll never forget the feeling of scrolling through those photos and videos as my heart shattered all over again.\n\n\n\nThrough it all, he still played the victim. He cried about being “fucked up” and “rotting in his own guilt.” He told me I’d be fine because “everyone loves you” while he had “no one.” Yeah, except the boys back home he never bothered to call. Guess speed-dial only worked for Tiffany.\n\n\n\nHe even punched a hole in the wall during a heated argument when I said her name, demanding why I kept bringing her up and swearing he was “done with her” because she’d moved departments. Sure. Meanwhile, the phone records showed he was calling her almost every single day even on the days he swore he loved me, that I was his “end game,” that he wanted to propose in Japan 2025, and that I was meant to be the mother of his children.\n\n\n\nUmm… \\*you\\* brought her into this relationship. So, \\*you\\* tell me why I keep bringing her name up.\n\n\n\nNothing but lies. Honestly, I wish I’d checked sooner and saved myself a few more months of that shitshow. Shoutout to FB reels for giving me the inspo to dig through the records, best LOL I’ve had in hindsight. Funny how “end game” looked a lot like unlimited minutes with her.\n\n\n\nBetween April and May, I even found searches like: “how to cope with suicide,” “most effective ways to suicide,” and “when all is lost where do I begin.” At first, I didn’t know if it was genuine despair or just another manipulation tactic. Either way, I reached out to his cousin and friend to keep an eye on him because I was worried while he never once extended that same care to me, leaving me to carry the emotional burden alone. For a while after discovering those searches, I held back on arguments. In hindsight, I think he used that to his advantage, even asking if there was a chance we could just live as “housemates” if things didn’t work out.\n\n\n\nWhat also disgusted me was when he went away for a weekend, to stay with his relatives. I finally had some quiet time to journal and process my thoughts, to which I later read them to him. I didn’t even make it half way and he was already acting up. He sneered: \\*“Wtf are you saying? Why are you writing weird shit? It’s like you haven’t listened to me for the past 2–3 months. You’re acting like the victim.”\\* \n\n\n\nUm… am I not a victim of his infidelity?\n\n\n\nThe lying just never stopped. Even in our first and only couples counselling session, when the therapist asked, \\*“So when you slept with Tiffany…”\\* he denied it to her face. Oscar-worthy performance if the category was Best Gaslighter.\n\n\n\nI finally reached out to Tiffany on 5th July. At first, she didn’t want to talk and said, \\*“I don’t think we should be having this conversation without Brad.”\\* Honestly, that told me everything I needed to know. I went in thinking maybe she’d been manipulated like me but come on. My clothes, my things, my life were everywhere in that house. There’s no way she didn’t know.\n\n\n\nShe admitted she’d asked him multiple times if he was single as she \"wasn't about to get into a relationship with someone who wasn't\". He lied every time. According to her, they’d been “official” since late February while he was still sleeping in my bed. She confirmed she’d been in my house. She confirmed the yellow lingerie was hers. She confirmed that I was the one who wanted counselling (initially yes but after the Tiffany's involvement, he wanted to push for multiple sessions), and he spun it as though he was just “supporting me.” Classic. The same man who begged to go, then flipped it to make me look needy.\n\n\n\nAnd the cherry on top? He was intimate with both of us, unprotected. Romantic right? No. Just disgusting. I told her to actually get tested just in case. I know my body count is 1 but god knows where else he’s inserted his downstairs in. \n\n\n\nInternet history was absolutely tragic. Forget “end game”, this 31 year old man was stuck on the tutorial level asking Google/YT how to play. From February through May he searched things like:\n\n\n\n\\* “How to attract women | 10 psychology techniques”\n\n\\* “3 Ways to make a woman fall for you on a first date”\n\n\\* “How to make her want you without trying hard”\n\n\\* “How to kiss someone for the first time”\n\n\\* “Get a girl that just got out of a relationship”\n\n\\* “How to pursue a woman without being needy”\n\n\\* “4 Ways to Attract Women without saying a word”\n\n\\* “How to behave around a girl you LIKE”\n\n\\* “The science of getting girls”\n\n\\* “First kiss advice | age, bad kisser & more”\n\n\\* “How to become more handsome (without changing your appearance)”\n\n\\* “AI girlfriend” shout out to candy ai.\n\n\\* “Porn games” shout out to jestur patreon. He actually played the game on the date that was printed on the photostrip too. I found the game and went into it. The man was playing in the early morning hours.\n\n\n\nI remember the emotions of the lies that boggled my mind. When I asked about the YouTube videos, he swore they were random ones that popped up and that I knew he always had YT running on his other monitor. But I never believed him, algorithms don’t jump from NBA highlights to “how to kiss a girl” tutorials. Not to mention, he used a different YT account on his PC. He studied IT in tafe too so not sure what kind of lie he was trying to make.\n\n\n\nA few hours after I kicked him out, he threatened legal action to claim “de facto” rights. After all the destruction he caused, he ended it with “sorry for the shit person that I am”. Now I’m left to clean up the mess he made: emotionally, legally and financially. Whilst he gets to move on, my nervous system is still wrecked; I live in fight-or-flight but I also feel lighter. Because at the end of the day, I dropped deadweight. I’m surrounded by love and will forever be grateful to everyone who have supported me. \n\n\n\nMy life honestly feels like it turned into a real-life Kdrama. I love watching them but living one? Nah man I’m good. Betrayal, plot twists, side characters, the whole circus. The only problem? My so-called “leading man” skipped the redemption arc and continued to play the diabolical villain. Plus there was no good looking second lead male so that was sad hey.\n\n\n\nScrew him, screw his crocodile tears, screw the way he tried to convince me I wasn’t enough. I was always enough; he just wasn’t man enough. He wasn’t my end game; he was just a badly written side quest that taught me my own worth.\n\n\n\nI hope the last time I ever have to cross paths with him was on 17th August, when he came to pick up the last of his belongings. Couldn’t resist a little send-off, I placed the rabbit toy packaging (he bought it to use on Tiffany and tried to hide it as a “private purchase” but the genius left the email confirmation in his inbox) right on top of his stuff, along with his ED medication for his uncles to see. He clocked it, and shoved them straight into the bin. When he got distracted, I went downstairs, fished the rabbit packaging back out, and put it right in front of his uncles this time. He spotted it, ripped it up, and stuffed it deeper in the trash.\n\n\n\nTo anyone else surviving infidelity: I hope you heal, find the peace and love that you truly deserve. Please never doubt your worth or silence your intuition. I gave my ex far too many chances to come clean and almost went insane. Most importantly, remind yourself there’s still light out there. Look for the stars and not the bars wherever you can! \n\n",

      "selftext": "Hello\n\nI got a call from my girlfriend of almost 2 years this morning telling me she cheated on me last night, and barely remembers it. This was so out of character and out the blue it’s really shocked me. \n\nI had a lot on today so only got to hers in the evening where she was crying and obviously very apologetic and confused. She said her and a friend who she met in the summer and has kept in contact with went on a pub/bar crawl with others but by the end was just them two, he said he was seeing someone but tried to kiss her at one point which she shot down, they carried on and instead of him going south to where he was staying she invited him to stay in her spare room. \n\nShe says it gets really hazy and fragmented from then, she remembers them kissing and getting handsy on her sofa and a flash of her sucking his dick. Then she stopped it and they went to separate beds, she then called me (I was asleep so didn’t answer) and texted if I was awake, then she woke up with a t shirt and no underwear in his bed without any memory of getting there. She swears these are the only memories she has and finds it hard to piece them together. \n\nShe said she called him today and asked if they had sex and he said no, she is taking full accountability for it and we have broken up. \nI find this all really bizarre as honestly no one would think she would do this, I’m struggling not to think she was taken advantage of, plowed with booze or even spiked, as that amount of memory loss just from booze I find a bit weird\n\nThe friend is mid 30s over 12+ years older than her, I guess I’m just looking for any advice / similar experiences.

I eventually left him after never being able to get over the cheating (he also got me sick one time but he claims that happened on “a break” so he didn’t technically cheat on me ig.) Anyways, after finding out about the engagement, I noted some weird captions like “you saved my life 11 years ago” from her (this would’ve been a year into dating me) and “remember when we held hands all sneaky like 10 years ago?” Also in the middle of my relationship with him. Confident he was cheating on me all along now and that the only reason I found out about it was cuz the girl told me. He got caught once but I’m sure he was always cheating on me. \n\n\nEdit: even after 10 years, I still am super deeply hurt he did that to me. Caused me so many issues in future relationships. Killed my self worth. If you cheat on any partner you’re truly a sack of shit and I hope you never find true happiness. ",

Truly. And I suppose that will always sting, and a part of me will always wonder if things would have gone differently had I been a better man.\n\nBut at the end of the day, no matter what else happened, I was always 100% committed and faithful. I can’t say the same for her. \n\nA big part of me wants what I will never have—for her to fight for me. To want me. To understand what she’s done to me, to our family, to herself. And I want that even though I’m done. But I’m beginning to accept the possibility that she simply doesn’t have the capacity to do so.\n\nI hate every part of this. I hate the fact that she didn’t embrace the gift of reconciliation after a betrayal of this magnitude. I hate that there’s a part of me still seeking external validation. I hate what is coming, and above all else I hate how it will hurt my son.\n\nI tried so hard to give her everything. I left a good career in large part to switch to a venture that would have given us geographical flexibility (she is from another country and an only child; I wanted us to be able to afford spending time in both countries). I failed in my ventures, and have damn near bankrupted myself keeping our lifestyle going. Which includes her taking our son to her home country for a month or two every year, whether I can make it or not. I feel used, unappreciated, unseen, and just plain fucking angry.\n\nI feel torn between wanting my son to know why the marriage ended, so he knows what not to accept and so he sees the truth rather than a bad example (her father cheated on her mother, they stayed together but it was miserable, and look what it did to her); and wanting him to not be burdened with hating his mom. I would walk over broken glass for him; I guess she is my broken glass. I’ll keep my silence, at least until he’s grown and can understand. Maybe.\n\nI have a lot to get sorted. I need to get a job asafp to be able to afford to physically separate. Lawyers. Therapist for our son. Counseling on how to split as amicably as possible. It’s all on me, given her breathtaking complacency.\n\nBut I have faith that, maybe someday soon, I’ll feel ok again. Until then, again, anyone who has been through this and come out the other side—please tell me if it does get better. And please tell me how you got past resentment, especially those of you who have to coparent with your betrayer.\n\nSincere thanks to all who took the time to chime in on my earlier post. You helped me more than words can express.",

      "title": "Husband had a drunken ONS 2 1/2 months ago and just told me two days ago",
      "selftext": "Hi all. My (28F) husband (28M) recently confessed to me about a drunken hook up he had 2 1/2 months ago. My husband’s father was diagnosed with cancer last December. Since then, his health has been getting progressively worse, and his chances of survival are looking more and more bleak. Back in July, my husband was medically retired from the military and took some time off to go back to his home state to visit family and spend time with his father. He was there for about 2 weeks, but we spoke every day. One night, while he was away, he went out with his best friend to a local brewery. While there, a girl who is supposedly a local at that brewery approached them and joined their conversation. After a while, my husband’s friend went home, but my husband stayed at the bar with this girl. Fast forward to the next morning, I wasn’t hearing from him so I tracked him and saw he was at a random apartment. His mother called me SOBBING because she had no idea where he was, couldn’t reach him, and actually ended up driving to the apartment complex and knocking on every door.\n\nFinally, she found him and immediately started cussing him out. She asked him, point blank, “were you in there hooking up?” To which he replied “absolutely not!” He said he got really drunk and wasn’t able to drive or figure out uber (he doesn’t have the app - he is chronically offline) but this girl offered him her couch to crash on. Naturally, his mom and I were LIVID and I didn’t believe him, but he swore up and down that nothing happened. It took me days to finally forgive him for that.\n\nWell, 2 nights ago, my husband randomly blurted out to me that he had a confession to make: that night, he didn’t sleep on her couch, but in her bed with her, after having drunken, unprotected sex. Immediately, my stomach dropped and a wave of panic, horror, and disgust washed over me. I was caught so off-guard and I don’t think the shock has worn off yet. I’m at a complete loss as to what to do next. The relationship I had before I met my husband ended due to my (obviously now ex) bf of the time repeatedly cheating on me (something that my husband was aware of and helping me still heal from).\n\nI’ve never felt more betrayed, embarrassed, or alone in my entire life. He’s been apologizing non-stop, crying, and begging for forgiveness and a second chance. After my last ex cheated on me, I told myself (and my husband) I would NEVER put up with cheating again. And yet, here I am, my head and my heart at odds with each other, leaving me confused, broken, and afraid. We live out west while both our families (and most of our friends) are back on the east coast, so I really don’t have much of a support system. I actually haven’t told anyone in fear of friends and family forever writing my husband off. The only other person who is aware what happened is his mother, and she is 100% on my side.\n\nSome important factors to add:\n\n1) Alcoholism runs rampant in both sides of my husband’s families. It’s actually drinking and smoking that are actively killing his father now (stage 4 throat, bone, and liver cancer) and that killed every other man in his family.\n        1a) When I met my husband almost 4 years ago, he rarely drank and was always very open with me about his family’s addiction problems, and always said how he never wanted to turn out like every other man in his family.\n\n2) As mentioned previously, my husband is former military. He was medically retired due to some mental health issues that flared on a 9-month deployment he was on back in 2023. After said deployment, I honestly didn’t (and still don’t) recognize the man that came home to me, and neither do his own mother. He became a raging alcoholic and it’s almost like the emotional, caring side of him died while he was deployed.\n\n3) 2025 has, quite literally, been the hardest year of our lives. I was laid off for 5 months at the beginning of the year (which completely depleted our savings), we lost two pregnancies, one of which was ectopic and ruptured, requiring emergency surgery, between our 2 dogs, we’ve been in an ER with one of them 4 times this year, my FIL is dying, and my husband’s grandfather and one of his aunts passed this year, just to name a few. So, although it’s no excuse, (because I would never have done to him what he did to me) there have been so many major stressors in our lives this year, we’ve both been struggling mentally and emotionally.\n\n4) My husband has struggled with major depression since childhood. He has been in and out of therapists since middle school, and has been on several different medications over the years in an attempt to help his psyche. Post-deployment, his bouts of depression have become longer and more severe, and I’ve been at a complete loss as to how to help him.\n\nI don’t write these factors as excuses, rather, it may just be my way of trying to justify his drunken mistake. I don’t know what to do at this point. A part of me wants to stay because, if and when we both get the professional help we need, I can see something beautiful grow from the ashes of our broken marriage. But at the same time, having been cheated on before and knowing how grueling and heart breaking the healing process is, I just don’t know that my heart can handle it again. Any and all advice is more than appreciated.",

      "selftext": "Long Post Alert 🔔\n\nContext:\nThis post unfolds in a deeply conservative South Asian society, where arranged marriages are routine, premarital relationships are taboo, and family honor and reputation weigh heavily on individuals. \nAgainst this backdrop, the post captures how two people, bound by tradition but touched by modern influences, navigate trust, betrayal, and a bold rediscovery of intimacy.\n\nNOV 2023:\nGot married in a fully arranged setup, never met, never talked, never even saw my wife (F) before the wedding.\nAt first, everything was awkward, even our sex life. Pretty uninteresting, but we both knew we needed time to build something. On top of that, it was a joint family setup, like most marriages here.\n\t•\tM: lived abroad, had exposure, casual flings, nothing serious.\n\t•\tF: small-town background, educated, unstable family, mom passed away a year earlier.\n\nFEB 2024:\nA few months in, I had to leave her and travel abroad for business. My life went back to normal, no flings this time, just friendships and harmless flirting. Meanwhile, she was struggling to adjust in a new house and new family environment.\n\nWe started having long video calls, chats, even sexting. That buildup actually made things exciting between us.\n\nSEPT 2024:\nWhen I came back, the first couple of weeks of married life were amazing, the chemistry was finally there. But one night, while casually using her phone, I stumbled upon archived WhatsApp chats. Normally, I never checked her phone, I respected her space, but that night, she asked me to reply someone, I opened WhatsApp. And BOOM \n\nThe chat had been going on for over 10 days (starting around the 3rd week after I returned). By the time I discovered it, it was the 5th week. At first, it looked innocent… but then turned into inappropriate for a married woman if she is in a close relationship also photo sharing happened as well. Not nude, not explicit, but enough to shake me to my core.\n\nI didn’t confront her immediately. The next day, I did, and she completely broke down. Devastated, apologizing non-stop. She was in disbelief like she would never have thought of getting caught. For days, we had harsh, emotional arguments but still shared the same bed. We tried to move forward, but trust was shattered. Arguments became routine. She had emotional meltdowns, I was disturbed, especially since the guy she’d been chatting with lived nearby.\n\nLater, she admitted this wasn’t random, he’d been in her life before marriage, and they had also exchanged inappropriate media earlier. She said that after marriage, it was only those 10 days. But I couldn’t believe her fully.\n\nIn the middle of this chaos, I pushed us to experiment, we smoked w££d and hash together, chasing raw, uninhibited moments. It gave us some steamy sessions, but things never felt like they did in those first couple of weeks.\n\nSEPT 2025:\nFast forward a year. I moved to another city while she stayed back. Distance brought even more arguments, we said things we didn’t have the courage to say face to face, especially her.\n\nThen something shifted and decided to reset things, call it Marriage 2.0.\n\nWe started having brutally honest conversations about our pasts: our first sexual awakenings, what we used to watch or read, what turned us on. Strangely, that openness brought us closer than ever.\n\nNow:\nWe’ve gone from betrayal to sharing our darkest fantasies. Talking about MMF, FFM, FF, even incest roleplay. Stuff I never thought would even cross our minds in such a conservative society.\nIt’s wild. It’s bold. It’s scary.\n\nMy Question:\nI don’t know what this relationship has become. We went from betrayal and broken trust to extreme openness and sharing fantasies that go way beyond what either of us imagined.\n\t•\tIs this a healthy “rebirth” of our marriage, or are we just escaping reality?\n\t•\tCan openness like this really rebuild trust?\n\t•\tOr are we just masking deeper problems with sexual exploration? \nI feel confused, lost, and honestly scared of where this is heading.\nWhat do you think?",

Trust is the number one thing for me in a relationship and he broke it to pieces. I know it was the right decision to call it off but it doesn’t make it less painful.

I've made the odd comment here and there trying to help people based on my experience, but this is the first time I feel I've needed help, hence my first post. \n\nLong story, I've wanted to put my entire story here for some time but honestly, didn't want to write it all out, and I didn't think I needed the support. I'm a bottle of wine deep at the moment and feel like I need help. \n\nIn a nutshell, wife had a drunk ONS before we were married, while we were engaged. I didn't find out for 5 years after, after marriage and 2 kids. I always suspected, but she vehemently denied. She came clean after those 5 years. It took some time, but we reconciled. It's now been 10 years since DD, 15 years since it happened. We added another kid (3 total), and my life is great. I couldn't be happier. 100% trust, just a fantastic life. Successful reconciliation story. \n\nI live in a completely different city from where this all took place, 15 years ago. Tonight I took one of my kids to their sport. Watched the game. After, I was walking to meet them after it was over. Was walking through a door, and someone held it open for me. They looked at me like they recognized me. I have terrible facial blindness, something that has bothered me for years. I can't remember anyone's face or name. They said my name, in a questioning tone. Ive been working on this fault of mine for a while now, and normally I would have just said hi and kept walking. But I've decided recently to put in more effort. I looked them straight in the eye and said 'im sorry, what's your name again', thinking they were one of my kids friends parents. He said his name, and the recognition came flooding in. It was like I was punched in the chest. My heart started pounding so hard and so fast, I thought I was having a heart attack. I then had my first out of body experience. I don't remember what was said, or what I did. All I remember was shaking his hand (I know!) and asking if he lived in my city (thank God he doesn't). After a few words, I said my kid was waiting for me and left. \n\nSince then, I came home, started drinking, and can't for the life of me get my heart to stop racing and pounding! I feel like this has all been a dream. I can't believe, 8 billion people in this world, how the hell do I run into him, randomly, in my city! \n\nWhy the hell did I shake his hand! Why was I so cordial? I'm disgusted with my self! Why didn't I tell him how I really felt? I'm not a violent guy, never been in a fight or thrown a punch in my life, was never going to do that. But why did I engage him. How do I get my heart to stop racing? How do I get to sleep tonight!  I honestly never thought I'd run into him, I never even thought to prepare for this, never thought it would happen. ",

I don’t think it was an affair with one person, more casual hook-ups is my guess.  I’m just truly puzzled, like, why would he not just use the bottle in the car for whatever situation or place it was needed?  Thank you.",

And he wants to bring her around our daughter at the 4 month mark we agreed upon \n\nIt really sucks because they’re clearly not stable if they’ve broken up twice since they first met in June, and we agreed that we would only bring serious partners around our daughter and our parenting plan says atleast 4 months of dating.. \n\nWould you argue the 4 month rule with him since they recently broke up and got back together or just suck it up? \n\nIt’s obviously hard for me since he cheated with her, but more than that he’s clearly not a stable relationship and I’m really trying to be protective  of my daughter. I’ve also been dating and I think he’s jealous since we have been going strong and stable since we met about 2.5 months ago and are the opposite of toxic \n",

      "selftext": "a couple of weeks ago i found out my boyfriend of 2 years, who i live with & have known for 7-8 years before we starting dating, has been cheating on me for at least 5 months. to make it worse, i found out 2 days before our 2 year anniversary.\n\ni only caught him because he had logged into tiktok on my phone when it got banned, he deleted it from his phone & couldn’t get it back for a bit. i accidentally opened his account instead of my old one & saw his recommended searches, they had stuff like “emo girls in rubber pants”, “stacked turkish girls”, “girls in leggings”, etc. it threw me off because he’s always said he wasn’t into girls who post online, wear a lot of makeup, or do cosplay kind of stuff. at first he tried to act like it was just random recommendations, but when i looked it up it said the recommendations do come from stuff that you’ve searched before. i ended up finding his saved videos & full watch history… there were hundreds of videos & searches of specific girls/accounts where they would post dancing tiktoks in bikinis, cosplay stuff, & he would even look at the links in their bios. after i confronted him, he denied it until i showed him everything. then he admitted it & blamed it on a “porn addiction”… but it wasn’t porn, it was just tiktok videos of girls dancing/doing provocative stuff. & honestly that just makes me feel even worse because it wasn’t some mindless thing, it was him actively seeking out these girls & videos online.\n\ni also got an IUD put in last year which caused me to have a lot of pain, depression, & a low sex drive. i would even have dreams about him cheating while it was going on (when i didn’t know) & asked him about it but he always denied it. during that whole time, he told me sex didn’t matter & that he loved me for me. i trusted him completely. i never thought he would do this to me & neither did any of our friends/family.\n\nhe told me he doesn’t know why he did it. he said he felt guilty every time, but still kept doing it, & most of the searches were in the middle of the night, like 1-4am, when i would be asleep. i asked him if he did it next to me while i was asleep & he said no, he would go into the bathroom. he swears it meant nothing to him, that he never wanted anything physical with those girls, & that he still loves me & only wants to be with me & that he’ll wait as long as i need to heal & forgive him. but after finding all of this stuff out it’s hard to believe anything that he says or trust him. & how can you say you don’t want anything with them when you were getting off to them. :/\n\nsince then, we’ve met up a few times to talk, but every time i just end up crying & having panic attacks. i haven’t been able to eat or sleep much, if i am able to fall asleep i end up waking up every hour or have nightmares about him cheating again. i love him so much, but this is my first time getting cheated on & he’s hurt me in a way i’ve never been hurt before... i just feel so broken & lost. it hasn’t even been a month, but all of the days are blending together & i don’t have the energy to do anything besides go to work. i just don’t know how to move forward.

      "selftext": "Here is my original story\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/GuyCry/s/SoebWrQ8iq\n\nWife cheated when we were dating(when she was 22-25yrs old). I caught her first time she was doing it and forgave her because she lied(she said she didn't have feelings for him. She just went out with him out of curiocity&loneliness since I wasn't around, I was doing my basic military training). She did cut him off completely right after but contacted him again 2 yrs after and got \"convinced\" to have sex with him. She stopped soon after they started(polygraph tested and passed). Never met him again.\n\nShe cheated with two more guys after that(couple of dates,kisses ,no sex, she confessed I had no idea). We moved to Canada and I married to her without knowing any of these and had a really good marriage(15yrs). No cheating after the marriage. She took two polygraphs and passed(she wanted to do it)\n\nShe did everything right since the Dday 1yr ago.  Really helped me to get over the initial shock. She moved her inheritance(250k) to my account to prove she is not with me for money. Later I moved the money to kids education fund account. \n\nI promised myself not to make an emotional decision so I thought about everything for a year. Now I am not in shock anymore and think I can make a logical decision.\n\nI CAN'T LET IT GO. She was my first and only but she was shopping around other guys while I was planning our future.  I was very cold to her for 3-4yrs after the first Dday and that probably made her do what she did but there is nobody to blame but herself. Things got much better after we got married.\n\nI did a therapy for a yr and it helped me to get over the initial shock but at the end of the day it is a brainwashing session. I am sad but I am fine. I can't find a way to forgive a serial cheating and 20yrs of lies. I need to lie to myself to do that. I won't do that.\n\nSo I will see the lawyer and we will start our separation with a separation agreement.  She promised me that she will give me a full custody and most of our assets. I promised her I will help her out financially for few years and let her visit the kids. One thing I can't absoultely accept is her introducing step father to them while I am still alive.\n\nI will maybe get a condo for her(I haven't told her) But she gave me a full control of the situation and I 100% know she will follow throuth. What I am doing is very controlling but she had no problem abusing me for over 20yrs. So I don't feel guilty.\n\nBut here is the problem. Kids.. they are 5,7yrs old. And they are very happy. I am not losing sleep over what she did but I am losing sleep over what they will have to go through. I am scared how divorce will change them. I am absoutly not blaming myself for it but I am genuinely concerned how it will change their life. \n\nWife has been an amazing mother and nobody can replace her. But also I can't live my life like this. \n\nI hate her so much to force me make an impossible decision. \n\nDoes anyone regret divorcing your spouse because kids are struggling? \n\nI know I wouldn't have been me without my parents' uncoditional love. \n\n\n\n",

      "selftext": "My history in this sub is long, and far too much to try to even abbreviate here but I'll try. If you want the full drama, check my profile. \n\nThis post will probably be just as long. I tend to ramble, and my thoughts are a mess. I'll try to tldr at the bottom. \n\nThe short, short, short version is my abusive ex had been cheating for years, spanning time from before I moved in with him until his confession after just over a year of marriage. During separation and then reconciliation he continued to have other relationships, to the point he managed to make me the Other Woman while still legally married. (That, I think, more than anything, is what finally got me to file.) Divorce went smoother than I expected. And then he went crazy. Broke into my new place (just a rented room) at least twice, hid in my closet/behind my bed and took photos and videos of me over at least 2 days, then sends those to the man I had been talking to, stole a bunch of my stuff, hung his clothes up in my closet like he lived there, and took off. Police reports and restraining orders ensue, court things happen... and no justice is served. \n\nI posted here a few months ago about how well Ive been doing. And I have been, still am. But even with everything going pretty great and my life slowly becoming more stable...\n\nGrief is an absolute monster that comes out of nowhere and tackles me like its Vince Wilfork and I'm Leon Washington. \n\nI was so proud of myself in that post, and the last couple of weeks have been so rough, I feel like I'm in quicksand. I keep seeing my friends and peers celebrating anniversaries of stable long term relationships, or starting new ones. I feel like I'm surrounded by other people's love for each other while completely alone. I'm happy for them. But I can feel it starting to turn me miserable and bitter. I hate that feeling. I hate that I'm reacting to situations in ways that further distance me from the people that are supposed to be my support system, just when I'm finally building one again. \n\nThe situation now is twofold\n\nFoldOne:\n\nMy roommate is sleeping with one woman (who I know for a fact wants a relationship and he doesn't), \"talking to\" another, and practically had his longtime ex on his lap tonight. I kept looking. I didn't mean to, honestly. Im autistic and I was confused and trying to figure out if the fact that she was sitting essentially on top of him meant something. ((Is it over with the fwb? Is he sleeping with multiple women? *Do they know about each other* if that is the case? Etc))\n\nI'm not trying to judge him. Technically he's single. But now I've got my ex in the back of my head. I trusted him for 20 years and look what he did to me. Ive only known roomie just under 2 years. Do I trust that the girl he's sleeping with *knows* she's just sex at this point, bc she didn't back when I talked to her, all doe eyed and starstruck on him. Can I trust that he's being honest with me? With them? \n\nAnd its not just \"is the guy I'm living with also a gotdamn cheater?\" I haven't been sexual with anyone since the one and only situationship after my divorce was finalized. Over a year. That's not the bother. The bother is I don't understand what is wrong with me. There seems to be something. There must be. I'm not a picky woman. Looks don't matter much, I couldn't care less about wealth. \n\n\nFoldTwo::\n\nI have so much love to give and everywhere I turn it seems I'm rejected. I've had a couple brief talking stages that led nowhere. I've created profiles and then uninstalled so many dating apps I think I've lost track. The last six months has seen my matches dwindle, my conversations fizzle, and any hope of a first date with anyone has become a speck in the rear view mirror. While I've changed nothing on my profiles or in my approach. \n\nAnd then whiplash. \n\nThe past few weeks has been crazy. I have been flirted with by multiple young men. *Young* men. This is not a brag. I'm confused. I'm flustered. I'm wondering when pigs started to fly when I realize the third one (22, the youngest, very attractive) was blatantly hitting on me and asking for my number. \n\nA 25 year old guy who works for the same company as me but in a different department has apparently been flirting with me for a long time. I honestly did not recognize it as flirting until it was pointed out by someone else. Reminder- I have the tism. And he was being a true gentleman about the way he conveyed his interest, and professional since it was, of course, at work. It's not something I would have easily picked up on. But I'm grateful to the neurotypical who pointed it out to me, as I do think this *kid* may be a good man and I'm very comfortable around him, but I'm pushing 40 and that's just... he's a baby, you know? Yes he's an adult but he's a baby adult. If I'd had kids when my parents did, they'd only be a couple years younger than him. It messes with my brain. But I like him. So I gather up my lady balls and I give him my number, unprompted. We have a great text chat day 1, plan to meet on day 2, day 2 ghosts, day 3 at work won't look at me. I'm confused. I don't understand. Day 3 later, a single text in which his entire demeanor has changed. I'm even more confused but text back an appropriate and supportive single message. Day 3 was today. \n\nI'm overwhelmed I think, by the combination of seeing (what feels like) everyone around me be in love and happy and getting what they want and seeing my roommate display womanizing tendencies while Life is over here dunking my head in the toilet over and over and over... and over. Like it got bored of slowly eroding my hope and decided to give me a few weeks as an unwilling Cougar before pulling the rug out from under me again. \n\nI know, I'm sorry. It's a ramble and it's a ramble about useless stupid stuff that is so first world problems it's physically painful. But this is my life and I'm living it and I have big feelings about it and barely anyone to talk to. My amazing therapist retired and I haven't found one since that I feel compatible with; I am looking though. \n\n**TL;DR** roommate has womanizing type behaviors that trigger me after being cheated on, ugly duckling turns into Cougar for 3 weeks, it's a prank by God. Tism overwhelm and bitterness?",

Lately I catch myself thinking things I’m ashamed of — like I only want to hear from her if she wants to fix this, and otherwise I don’t want to hear from her ever again. Sometimes my thoughts even go darker, and I imagine only hearing news if she’s been harmed or has died. I don’t want to act on anything like that — I’m ashamed these thoughts exist, but they’re very real.\n\nFor those of you who have been through this:\nHow did you cope with the intensity of the anger and rage?\n\nHow did you manage the part of you that still wanted reconciliation, even when the situation felt unhealthy?\n\nWhat practical steps helped you move forward without getting swallowed by these feelings?\n\nI’m trying to heal (gym + therapy), and I’d appreciate honest, compassionate advice or stories from anyone who’s been here. Thank you.",

For a little context my fiancé has physically cheated on me once, about 7 months ago but since then I’ve found out about him watching porn and liking some other woman’s photos (sexy cosplayer/bikini pics that type of thing). Ever since my self esteem has been in the trash, it’s brought up issues from my childhood that I didn’t realize were still there. My abandonment issues, the fact that I’ve never been enough for anyone in my life. I know I need to start therapy and that’s definitely the next step but honestly I just don’t know what to do right now. I’m still with him and we’re trying to make things work but I do know he’s watched porn in the past few months. He tells me how he wants to stop and that he will, he tried downloading a porn blocker app once but it was hella expensive so that didn’t work out. I just don’t know how much longer I should give him honestly…I’m starting to feel so bad about myself, starting to wonder why I’m even here in the first place. Any tips or thoughts are appreciated 🫶",

We had an argument on a Monday night and I decided that I wanted to go stay with my parents for the week, to give both of us some space. We were to meet back up on Friday and talk. I found out tonight that the Monday night I went to my parents, she had sent her new “friend” a nude and had planned to meet up with him in the upcoming weekends. I feel so lost, angry, sad and betrayed! Has any one got any tips on how to pick myself back up and move on!

We’re actually not married and have no children. \nBetrayal was really bad (several years, multiple APs), but I can’t ignore that we had a lot of good between us and I haven’t gone completely cold on her. \n\nAfter D-Day nearly 2 months ago she has been doing all the right steps. She has started therapy. she went NC with AP, and removed any triggers from our life. We’re both financially independent and with savings, but she has agreed to split assets in a way that puts her at significant disadvantage, losing a significant amount of money to me (I was a bit of an AH on that but I needed to test her). she has gone full disclosure (I have read her messages with APs and her disclosure mostly matches). Our sex life has greatly improved (hysterical bonding, I guess, but also she’s opening to me some sides of her that were previously hidden). I have a feeling that she is truly remorseful. she has committed to never lie again and to be a better person overall. \nI just know she could become a better person. I know she has the willpower to do that if she is really committed. If that happens, I feel that we could achieve reconciliation, although it’s still far off for now.\n\nI have been wanting children for several years, but she didn’t want them. I guess they would have gotten in the way of her double life. After D-Day the tables have turned: she really wants a child now. I want to have it too but I would prefer to wait until full reconciliation, but if we wait much longer she may never be able to. We discussed that and she would like to have a child with me even if reconciliation didn’t work and we had to breakup.\n\nSo my question is: has any other BH have had children shortly (less than 1 year) after D-Day? Are you happy with your choices? Any regrets?",

      "title": "trying to reconcile with fiance",
      "selftext": "It's been a month and a half since dday. I found out about the cheating after going through his phone in the middle of the night and seeing a text from his friend's wife asking about if this woman was mad at him for setting them up. I asked (for the 20th time) at breakfast the next morning if he was cheating and to please please just be real with me and he finally admitted it but said they just went to coffee a few times and kissed once and that was it. Later that day the AP called me and told me every detail of their affair for and hour and a half. I found out that it started in April when I left town for an extended period of time and at that time my fiance and I were on the brink of breaking up but we were just taking some space and communicating a ton and rebuilding our communication with distance. The AP basically called me and told me I didn't deserve any of this and I would meet someone else one day, she said \"you'll meet your person\" basically implying that my fiance is her person. She also embellished many details and told me that they were in love. Her entire point was to try to get me to leave him.\n\nMy fiance left the house while I was on that call outside and he slept in his car that night, turned off his phone, and had a mental breakdown. The next day he came back home and begged for me to stay, he wrote out 10 pages of why he wanted to be with me and how massive of a mistake he made and will never do it again and he wrote out all the reasons why he loves me and was extremely remorseful. He immediately blocked the AP and hasn't spoken to her at all since. He searched for an affair recovery therapy program that we immediately enrolled in, it was very expensive.\n\nWe have been engaged since 2023 and were supposed to get married that year but I called it off because it felt rushed for me but I was so ready to get married this year and was really wanting to have a baby asap. I'm turning 39 next month. We got engaged after only knowing each other for 6 months and I moved from another state to be with him, so we are in his hometown with all his old friends from high school and all his family. The AP was an \"old friend\" from high school that is friends of his friends in town.\n\nI never in a million years would have thought this man would cheat on me especially since his ex wife was a serial cheater. It was always something we bonded over how loyalty was so important and he is a very honorable person in the community, he's been in the army for over 20 years and he owns his own business and many people in our community love and trust this man. He doesn't have shady characteristics, he is truly generous and kindhearted. So it's extremely crushing to think he is capable of doing this to me and even he says he doesn't understand how he was able to do this. He is very remorseful and apologizes to me multiple times a day. I have seen changes in him but I don't know if it's enough for me.\n\nA few background details to this story before the cheating:  We were having major problems with our communication and were constantly bickering and being defensive to each other around the time leading up to when the physical cheating started (April) but I learned that they had been texting and occasionally calling since last October. Our problems started last summer and we never went to therapy or anything, but they got worse and I attribute it now to the fact that he was talking to this woman. Also our sex life has always been very active and continued to be active all summer, so it's not that he was looking for sex, I definitely know it was more about validation. He told me the reason why he liked her is because she was \"nice to him\". He says that he went out with her in April when I left because he thought we were basically breaking up, he said he was 100% sure were done. But then continued to call and text and facetime the entire time I was gone and act like he was in love with me. I definitely did not think we were broken up at all. \n\nClearly I'm still trying to wrap my head around all this and I definitely have PTSD from it. I want to stay with him but I also want to leave. He says he could never do this again and I actually believe him because he is traumatized by how traumatized I am and I do see it affecting him. I don't think I can ever get over this and be myself again and have the fairytale I've always dreamed of. I do really love him but I don't know if I can let myself be with a person who would be capable of doing this to me. My heart is beyond broken. I really want children and a family and it feels like starting over at 39 is crazy. I don't even know if I can find love again and trust someone. I trusted this man so much he was literally the best person I've ever been with before all this. I really never would think he would cheat. He tells me he regrets ever talking to her and wishes he could go back in time and make different decisions. He tells me that he wishes he just communicated his feelings about our relationship to me and none of this would have happened. I still feel regretful that I left town in April because I don't think they would have kept talking if I were in town, he told me that he told her he can't talk to her ever again right before I left in April but then she kept reaching out and I was gone so he hung out with her. But I still feel like if I were in town and we just would have worked on our relationship, none of this would have happened. But now that it did, I feel embarrassed to be with someone who could betray me. It's so out of alignment with who I am. I would never do this to him because loyalty and honesty are some of my biggest values. I do feel that my friends and family will think I'm settling and I'm embarrassed that I would allow myself to be with someone who had such little regard for me and disrespect for me. Also his whole friend group knows about it, they didn't condone it but they know that he did that to me.\n\nI just feel so sad and like I'm in this fog and can't see clearly right now. I imagined my life with him for 3 years now and I do feel he is my person, but I also know that my person would never and could never do this to me no matter how rocky our relationship got or if he thought the relationship was \"basically over.\"\n\nI'm looking for advice for both reconciliation and possibly moving on. I'm having a really hard time right now.",

      "selftext": "A follow up to my previous post. I’ve been thinking a lot about what I could done differently and the list of criticism before she bounced. Lately I’ve haven‘t like myself very much. I try to go on but things just don’t feel the same. Maybe she was right, maybe I sjökld make some changes. Things she criticized:\n\n- living with my sister instead of on my own: I recently started a new position at a big firm. Pay is decent but probably not as much as her new guy. To be fair he is a lot older than me. My plan is as follows: play off my debt until February and then start saving. Once I saved enough (and passed my probation) I’ll start looking for a place\n- too much gaming: my friends say didn’t game too much but perhaps I should cut it back. I think I’ll quit my more nerdy hobbies like card games and begin more „attractive hobbies“, she specially mentioned learning a (her) language (Chinese) and cooking \n- I will sign up for a language course after my probation, right now I have too much debt to pay off\n- my cooking is very basic and boring. I could try to practice more interesting cooking once a week (again, I have to be careful with the budget until the probation time is over)\n- I didn’t „get“ her and we didn’t spent enough time together. This is very debatable in my opinion. We don’t live in same city and visit her by train every week. So I’m not sure what else to do here. As for the „not getting“ part, perhaps our communication was not great. I’ll buy some relationship books and look into this further\n- is there anything else I can do? I think I’ll start reviewing my work on the weekend. I remember she really wanted me to do that but at the time I felt like „enough work it’s the weekend“. I forgot how important money is in relationships, you can’t seem like you’re slacking off\n- i see a lot of these gym bros/hustlers on instagram, perhaps I should model myself more after them? ",

My husband (17 years together, married for 12 years) cheated on me and as if that wasn’t enough, the person he cheated with was also scamming him (been going on for 3 weeks before I found out). So not only did he betray me and our marriage, but he also handed over our money ($1,000) and trust to someone who was using him.\n\nThe worst part is that he was willing to drop everything for her. Before I found out (found out by walking in on him using a secret phone) he was ready to risk his job, our home, and our family just to meet up with her. He says he was manipulated, but to me it doesn’t matter, he still chose to cheat. It makes me feel like I wasn’t enough, like I was stupid for trusting him, and like I’m left to pick up the pieces while he gets to play the victim of being “scammed.”\n\nWe live paycheck to paycheck, so knowing he was prepared to throw away our stability for someone else makes it even harder to swallow. It’s not just emotional betrayal, it’s financial too. I feel like he disrespected me, our kids, and everything we’ve worked for.\n\nI feel humiliated. I feel broken. And I feel so alone because I can’t find anyone who has gone through this exact combination, being cheated on and scammed at the same time. Has anyone else experienced something like this? Did you stay? Did you leave? How did you cope?\n\nRight now I just need to hear that I’m not the only one.\n",

She is absolutely remorseful, she’s going to therapy and doing anything I ask as far as rebuilding.\n\nShe immediately cut off all contact (my actions helped ensure this…).\n\nI’m 99.9% I know all of the key details for several reasons, including text exchanges between her and her closest girl-friend that I accessed from before and since D-Day.  Also based in conversations with the AP’s wife and comparing details.\n\nAnyway, I’m interested in hearing from other folks who divorced after an EA.  Sometimes I feel like divorce is extreme for an EA.  But then I absolutely know an EA is just as - possibly more - harmful/hurtful than a purely PA, particularly an EA that did have an explicit sexual component.\n\nShe’s absolutely remorseful and again is stepping up to do the things.  I 100% believe there is still love and a connection that can be repaired.  I suppose the right thing is to give it some time and see if we make progress.  Pulling the trigger on D 1 month in could easily be a huge regret in the rear view mirror down the road.  But boy does it hit me hard from day to day.\n\nThanks friends.\n\nEdit 1:  yeah, I’m fairly confident it could have turned physical eventually if I hadn’t caught her.  I also know divorce isn’t the magic easy road some think.  I’ll still have to co-parent with this person.  And yes, of course I have the “staying together could be seen as a sign of permission for her to do it again” thoughts.  It’s ugly, awful, painful, horrible stuff…  taking it day by day.

He started using a lot of weed (not judging that but imo if you use it all day to the extreme then that's a problem). I feel really cold and mean because I feel sad for his loss but also it's blurred with all the resentment and anger and hurt from his betrayal. He had no issues leaving me sad and depressed for over 2 years while he was cheating. So I'm torn because I could offer comfort but he's still going to live with his mistress, he still isn't apologizing to me so it feels like he'd just take my kindness and leave me in the dust which he has done countless times. However I still feel largely responsible and guilty for not being there. I don't know what to do.\n\nPrior to this he's not been respecting my boundaries about not wanting to keep hearing from him because he isn't willing to work on healing the damage done by his affairs. I've gone no contact and blocked his number but only last about 2 weeks at best because he sends me gifts to my house and then I feel guilty. He acts and talks like we are still together even though he moved out 9 months ago and we are divorced and I will not talk to him for weeks and told him we are not together. He made his choice and can find someone else who is okay with polygamy.\n\nI was clear that to be with me he'd have to cut all contact with other women and solely focus on rebuilding a consistent relationship and date for at least 6 months to see if it could work. He isn't willing to do that so idk why he is making me feel like the villian? He says I left him and that I don't really love him and am throwing us away because he has a flaw of not being loyal. Am I losing my mind??? I feel that asking him to be loyal is very minimal for a relationship and he expected that of me (to be loyal to only him) while he has another woman.\n\nI just want to feel free to move on and get over this chapter of my life but I have so much guilt and feel like a horrible person.

They fought and she contacted me with all the details. Now i decided to forgive him, try to move on and work on trusting him again but it’s been really hard accepting everything and not getting triggered at every occasion. I try not to suffocate him but i end up having messed up ideas. He is traveling alone again (I can’t come with due to visa issues) and i find it hard to deal with all the insecurities. I believe he is sincere in wanting to fix things and being committed to me 100% but I can’t help shake off the feeling of betrayal. ",

      "selftext": "I found out my wife of 3 years had been having a physical and emotional affair with another man since last November. I found out in the worst way, going through her phone, something I told myself I would never do because I respect and value her privacy. The things I saw I can't unsee, declarations of love, sexual messages, intimate pictures, not to mention flirtatious conversations with men other than her affair partner. I packed a bag and left the house immediately, that was two weeks ago. \n\nIt’s been devastating, we were planning the next phase of our life together, a kid in the next couple of years, moving for family and friends. \n\nShe denied it when I confronted her, until I forced her to admit after saying that I had seen all of the messages (yes, I have pictures of them). She has blamed me, saying that my drinking drove her to do this. I had spent the two weeks leading up to the discovering taking accountability for what started as a drink or two, to 5-6 beers a night feeling normal. I was drinking to silence my pain, knowing for months that something was off with her. I've sought help, and will address this for me. I have come to her multiple times since last November, asking her if something was going on with another man. She denied it, called me paranoid, codependent, that I was the one with the issues. My drinking was not the right way to cope when I knew something was wrong, I cannot blame her for that, but she does blame it for her cheating. \n\nShe is pleading with me to do therapy, saying she wants to face things head on, that she's ready for us to heal the wounds of the past, that she just wants to be together, to see me flourish and be happy. I truly do not know what to believe, or if it is worth it to try to go through what will be a painful process, and will likely involve a lot more blame shifting/gaslighting. I am so sad, this is the person I believed to be my soulmate, and I truly can't comprehend going through the pain of separating our lives. But that pain will be acute, and perhaps better than years of confusion, never knowing when it will happen again. \n\nI sent the message last night, saying that I had thought about it, and that I could not see a way forward. I've been out of town, so will be back on Sunday, and asked her if she could please find a place to stay when I get back. I am worried for her wellbeing, and all I want to do is comfort her, tell her everything will be alright, and go back to her and rebuild. But I understand I've been lied to, have been living in someone else's reality, and that I will likely spare myself years of pain by leaving now.  \nAny encouragement one way or another would be much appreciated.",

I’m 24, was together with my stbxh for 5 years and married for one. \n\nHe is living with AP. Two weeks ago we had a “final” talk where I was able to say my piece. He cried and said he was miserable and wanted his life back etc etc and kissed me. It has been really messing with me since I’d been doing well with NC and I felt like I got my hopes up despite not wanting to stay together if that makes sense. Then a few days later he changed his mind again and said he wants to “be better now and not cheat on her”. \n\nAnyway, the point of this post is I have been trying to get out there and do new things and meet people, and make a life that has nothing to do with him. Starting attending a new church, going to a Bible study and other events. However whenever I’m doing that i feel even more alone. I have always been generally confident, able to have good conversations, small talk etc and meet new people. \n\nBut i feel like now i sit there and im in a different world than everyone else. I have this huge thing that just happened and is currently happening to me and I can’t really talk about it. I had a whole life that is just gone now. I feel like I’m lying cause I have to leave out this enormous part of my life, something that takes up like 99% of my brain at the moment. Everything triggers me, people asking what I do, where I live, anything about me because everything is so tied to my soon to be ex husband. \n\nI always hear that you should get out and do new things and meet new people etc but I just keep feeling like I must not be ready because I feel like I intensely disassociate and just want to leave and be alone the whole time. I really have no interest in meeting new people and making small talk etc I just know I want to make new friends and eventually meet someone else so I feel like I have to. \n\nShould I maybe hold off on doing this until things feel more normal? Or should I just continue to force myself to get out there and eventually it’ll get easier? ",

      "title": "After 3 months of no contact, she called me.",
      "selftext": "She called me on Sunday afternoon. It was less than a 10-second call. \"I felt in my sleep you were not okay, so I just wanted to check.\" I don't even remember what I said or replied, if at all. I was physically shaking for an hour after that. I had unbearable anxiety for the whole day, as if I wanted to fight a bear. I couldn't eat, focus, or even sleep at night.\n\nBack in March, around her birthday, I first found out that she was cheating on me — with six different people, well, six different people that I know of. Going on dates, sending objectionable snaps, making out with her ex: emotional and physical cheating. She was cheating on me on some of the most important days of our relationship. Had a 320-day Snapchat streak with her ex whose contact was saved as \"Boo\" with a heart. Our relationship was six months old at this point. I poured my soul out for her, while receiving not even the bare minimum in return. The more she pulled away, the more effort I put in. And when I tried to leave because my needs weren't met, I was called \"emotional,\" \"sensitive,\" \"needy,\" and whatever else you can think of to basically gaslight or emasculate me. I once wrote a Reddit post with 27 objective points of what she had done to me (I had no idea about the cheating at that time) to which I received snide comments about growing a spine and how unbelievable it was that I was letting her do that to me. And I agree with the comments. I couldn't leave because she was good at pretending to genuinely apologize. She knew with detailed precision the things she was doing that were hurting me and framed her apologies addressing that pain, which really made me believe she was genuinely sorry. So I kept trying.\n\nI left when I found out I was being cheated on. I tried to. I was a fetal, sobbing mess. It took me months to recover physically from how sick I was — I couldn't even look at food without wanting to puke. She kept coming over to my place. I kept letting her stay over because she was now loving and I was in love with her. All I ever needed was that version of her where she was just nice to me. I couldn't tell her to go away then. I tried cutting her off when I found out she was still hanging out with one of the guys from her roster. We went into no contact where she tried reaching out a couple of times.\n\nMy grandma, someone I really, really loved and who really loved me — probably even more than my own mother — unexpectedly passed away in May. I couldn't even grieve properly. I came back from my hometown from her funeral at the start of June. She reached out, or maybe I did when I came back. She knew what had happened. She stayed over a few times again. All through this she made me believe she wanted to fix things and she'd do her best to help me. She still wanted to marry me, apparently. I was grieving and I kept letting her in. One night, shortly after, she came over to my place completely drunk from her work dinner. In the middle of the night I got anxious and said, \"Someone keeps texting you in the middle of the night.\" She kept her internet off; no one was texting — I was anxious and I was just fishing.\n\nI found two new guys she was now flirting with. One from her gym, whom she was sending cute voice notes to on her way to my place, responding to his flirtation, going on dates. Another was a Bumble match — the profile she made within the last few weeks, while I was grieving. This guy, she apparently was considering dating seriously, while sleeping with me and was hoping to marry him now. She left the next morning. I begged her to stay. I was scared to be alone with myself in that moment. I begged her to stay as I followed her to the street where her cab waited to pick her up. \"I cannot answer your questions,\" she kept repeating. She left me a broken mess again while I kept begging, literally physically begging with folded hands, for her to stay. The world saw. She didn't give a fuck then if I was okay or not. I wasn't — not for days. I hurt myself for the first time then. I puked my guts out. She, on the other hand, went out on a trek with the same bumble guy the next day. I had sleep paralysis. I had derealization episodes where I couldn't tell what was real and what was not.  I have been in therapy since. I cut off everything and everyone.\n\nI was finally doing a little better — just a little. Now she calls me up to check \"if I'm okay.\" She knew for a fact that I was not okay when she left. Made me beg then. I don't think the call was about me. But it has fucked me up again since. It has set me back from whatever progress I thought I was making. I'm a mess again.",

      "selftext": "This is my first post. I really need help because I feel like i am spiraling. \n\nI (F25) just ended things with my boyfriend of 5 years (M25) after he disclosed to cheating on me with 5 different women over the course of 1 year. 1 of the 5 women was a long term affair & the other 4 were \"just sex\" & \"not important to him.\" I tried working things out with him for 6 weeks & it just got worse, so I ended the relationship before it put me in a hospital. But I am completely devastated & miss him everyday. \n\nFor context, we lived in the same state about 10 mins away from eachother our entire relationship. About 4 years into it, he moved out of state in November 2024 for work & we became long distance. \n\nD-Day was July 25th, 2025. He called me at work & told me he had been having an affair with a woman in his new state that lasted from mid March until first week of June 2025. She found out he cheated on her with me when he visited our home state & ended things with him. He had been contemplating telling me and it took him a month & a half before he did. I was absolutely gutted & devastated, sick to my stomach. \n\nWe talked & decided to try and mend the relationship as opposed to ending it. I told him I was willing to forgive, as long as he finally went to therapy as I had begged him to do for several years at this point. I also said after he did solo therapy for a while, I wanted to transition to couple's therapy. He apologized for his actions profusely & agreed to my stipulations. \n\nHowever, it became clear very quickly that this wasnt a typical cheating situation in the way I had heard about. I always heard about cheating partners confessing or getting caught & then doing EVERYTHING in their power to fix the relationship, whether that be apologizing profusely, love bombing, immediately getting in therapy, etc...But I soon realized this wasn't what this situation was like. \n\nThe entire 6 weeks I attempting mending things consisted of him being extremely emotional about his mistress. He would flip flop between being completely, head over heels infatuated & obsessed with her to thinking she was a disgusting & horrible person. I realized he was very obsessed with her because he constantly talked to me about how he felt she was the love of his life, he wanted to marry her/her have his kids, that he missed her, & that if she came back he would go with her even though we were working on fixing our relationship. Hearing this I was devstated and shocked & it just hurt me in way I cannot describe. \n\nOn the flip side, he would go from talking about her this way, to describing how self-absorbed, emotionally unavailable, and unkind she was. I do believe this to be true because based on her social media...she does seem to be that kind of person. He would talk about how she made him feel neglected, she didnt like physical touch, she talked down to him, made fun of him or laughed at him for having emotions or when he was in physical pain. He said he felt like he couldnt be himself around her & that he always had anxiety about saying the wrong thing to her & she would threaten him. This made me extremely upset because I couldn't believe he would waste any time on a person like this, at the risk of our 5 year relationship & future. He repeatedly said he agreed & that \"this was why he couldn't choose between both of us.\" He said I was caring, emotionally available, and loving in ways she just wasnt at all. This gave me hope we could get past this because WHY on earth would you throw away a relationship with a person that is honest, loving, caring, forgiving, and committed to you? I felt like he just needed to get his mental health in check, do some soul searching & we could get past this...\n\nHe also told me she had extremely disgusting habits, which \"made him realize how down bad & delusional he was in his loneliness.\" He said she didnt believe in using body wash/soap & instead used shampoo because it was \"cheaper.\" As a result, she smelled musty in several places on her body. She also told him she slept with 12 men, some of whom were strangers in other found on vacation & didnt know at all. She also had a file on her phone with pictures of every man she claimed to have kissed & that there were 40-50 different men in the file. This was mind boggling to me that he would risk our relationship, disrespect me, and risk BOTH of us contracting STDs from someone who behaved this way. \n\nThen he started saying he also wanted to be with her because she could provide things i couldn't. For reference, I live in the DMV area, which is pretty expensive. I am also a law student & work full time at a courthouse. I live with my parents at home, but we discussed us moving out when he finally moved back. The state he moved to is in the deep south & its extremely cheap to live there. As a result, his mistress  was a homeowner and had extra money to do things i just cannot afford. She took him on weekend trips, planned vacations with him, cooked dinner with him every night, had a place all to herself, and could work from home. He told me he didnt see himself marrying me because he wants to get married as soon as possible & have kids ASAP. He also said before having kids, he wants to travel (which is also a huge dream of mine). He said because of my pending law school debt & living situation, I don't fit the life he currently wants. I was devastated & told him we could work these things out & that we shouldn't end our relationship over materialistic things, especially if the alternative person isnt loving & caring. \n\nAfter this, he started saying that he also didnt see himself marrying me if I didnt become more \"wife material.\" He said I was too overweight & he needed me to lose weight so he could be attracted to me again & \"check back into our relationship because right now he only loved me as his best friend, not a romantic partner.\" During this time, I had called different therapists every single day to get appointments, filled out intake forms on his behalf because \"he was too depressed to do them\", and all I would need was his insurance card to officially book him appointments. On several occasions, he procrastinated in getting me his insurance card, then he would look up whatever therapist I found & tell me he didnt like something about them, so I would go searching for a new one. This happened 2-3 times until i told him he needed to find his own & that I would support him however he needed. It's no surprise that as of when we broke up 2 weeks ago, he still had not gotten a therapist. \n\nEventually, he came to visit me in the DMV for labor day and we had a full weekend of reconnecting. This was the second time we had visited eachother since D-Day. The first time, I flew to him a week after finding out about the affair & it was terrible. All we did was sob the entire time. However, this second trip was amazing & it finally felt like old times. I thought we were finally on the up & up so to speak. But at the end of the trip, I was taking him back to his parents house so they could drive him to the airport & he burst into tears. I thought he was crying because we were about to be separated again. But then he looked at me & said \"I feel really bad because I had an amazing time this weekend, but I wish she was here instead.\" \n\nHearing that broke me. I cried, screamed, pleaded, yelled, got angry, and got sad. For the rest of the day i begged him and argued with him, telling him I would be gone forever and he was throwing our relationship away over his infatuation & lust for another woman that clearly didnt care about him based on her words & actions. In addition, his friend in his new state had recently seen her on Hinge, so clearly she wasnt hung up on him either.\n\nAt the end of the day, after he flew home & we had been fighting for hours, I said \"Idk. I feel like I should reach out to her and tell her we were together for 5 years. If I were her, I would want to know.\" For context, he told me she knew he slept with someone else but was still unaware who it was & that i was his partner of 5 years. When I said this, he got extremely quiet & said \"...you dont wanna do that...\" in a taunting way. I was like \"why wouldn't i?\" He said \"Trust me. You're going to regret that.\" I ended up pushing him until he told me that if I reached out to her, I would actually end up finding out about other women he slept with in his new state that he would hook up with when his affair partner made him angry. So instead of his mistress knowing about ME..his long term partner of 5 years who stood beside him & loved him genuinely.. she actually knew about a bunch of random women from hinge that he had casual hookups with. \n\nI was broken beyond words. I ended the relationship the next morning even though I didn't want to. Since then, he has contacted me repeatedly begging for me not to leave him and that he loves me. When I tell him why I won't come back, he gets nasty & angry & tells me he hates me. \n\nDuring one of these exchanges, I realized his timeline of the 4 women in the new state didnt make sense, so I told him I realized he was still lying. I said it was unfair & he has lied enough & I wanted the entire truth. After pulling it out of him, he ended up disclosing that the first time he cheated was with a woman on several occasions back in our home state 1 year ago, while I was recovering from throat surgery. Then, he cheated with 1 woman in the new state the entire month of January 2025 (i visited him during this month as well), then with another woman in the new state in February 2025 (he had come & visited me that month too) and then he met the affair partner & made her his second girlfriend in March 2025. Then, during a fight with his affair partner, he cheated on both of us with a one night stand in April 2025 that she discovered in June 2025. \n\nSince then, he has reached out to more times begging for me to come back & that he misses me. I keep telling him I love him but that I cannot & will not be with him anymore. I'm so heartbroken and miss him so much. \n\nIf you read this far, thank you for reading. :( ",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI’m taking a swing at this so here goes. I knew my boyfriend for a few months and he love bombed me right away. He immediately wanted me to be his girlfriend and I kept saying no as I wanted to grow together more and I had big big dreams (had *sigh). When I didn’t talk to him he would get so sad. He always wanted validation from me about how I felt about him. I felt we were having the same conversation weekly. He always chalked it up to just how much he loved and cared about me. Anyways, I ended up pregnant which was a complete shock. But it was to be his first child and he seemed so happy. But immediately he told me h was moving closer to his job. We talked about not moving so fast and getting a house together once the baby was a little older. We wanted to take things slow(er) and I agreed to officially be in a relationship with him. I saw him dramatically less and less and he spoke to me less and less the second he moved. When I did see him my intuition told me he was cheating and I begged for the truth. He told me he was faithful. He would see me here and there for 2 hours  and would leave. Weeks went on and he left me for days on end with no contact. I was pregnant and alone. \n\nAfter a solo trip to the ER for some bleeding and cramping I was told my baby who once had a heartbeat no longer had one and I should prep for a miscarriage. I was DEVASTATED. He was no where to be found but replied the next day. He talked to me a little more since he was worried he had lost his baby but was still distant. A week before an appointment to confirm the miscarriage I got a text from an unknown number. She said she was the woman who he was living with. I was shocked and heartbroken. She said that she was not upset with me but just wanted proof so she could kick him out. I told her everything and she followed through with her threat to kick him out. He immediately called me 30 times. He was so caught up in that that he missed the appointment confirming the miscarriage. I was left to hear that news alone. Once I told him and confronted him he tried to lie his way back to me but I refused. He cut me off. \n\n The pain of losing my baby and him cheating was too much for my brain to process. I reached out in hopes we could just talk and process the loss of our child. I hoped for friendship atleast given we were grieving. Come to find out the girl took him back and he told me I meant nothing to him, he never loved me. And he never wanted to be with me. While I have text messages and conversations that prove this isn’t true, I am devastated. I couldn’t believe the ex took him back and that’s he immediately turned on me. \n\nI’m hoping for some kind advice on how I’ll heal from this. I’m kicking myself for ignoring the red flags and am trying not to fall into the disbelief that I deserved this. ",

      "title": "A man kissed my wife (25F) and she kissed him back.",
      "selftext": "My wife(25F) and I(30M) have been together for five years and married for just over three months. Today, she told me a few weeks ago that the mechanic that she often goes to leaned into her car while she was at the shop and tried to kiss her, she said she kissed him back.  \n\nMy wife and I met in college, we've always been like best friends, had consistent great sex, and overall just good chemistry.  We've always trusted each other. About three years ago we had a disagreement about wanting kids and it was the first time we talked about it. The talk ended up with us \"taking a break\". We weren't living together at the time, though we only lived a few minutes away from each other. Anyways, a few week after that we were back together she admitted something to me. She said her male friend, had come over to console her and he kissed her but she  immediately rejected him. She said at that time, she felt lonely and genuinely just wanted to talk to anyone who would listen. I was not mad or upset with her in this certain situation because I know of her mental health issues and self-esteem issues that come along with depression and past trauma. I do not think her intention was to kiss him at this time. This man was a local mechanic who always did work on her car, often for free or a discounted price. I told her I was not comfortable with this scenario after this and didn't want her to go to his shop anymore.\n\n  \nFast forward to 2025 and we bought a house together, got married, and have been living together for the last 3 years. I've always trusted my partner 100% of the time, we share our locations 24/7 and are very comfortable with using each others phones daily. I 100% believe she would never intentionally cheat. About a year ago she started going back to this mechanic because again, he would either not charge her for some work or give her a big discount. Money was tight and I told her i was still uncomfortable, but if she could \"use\" him for cheap labor thats fine.  He has tried to make weird comments or advances and she immediately would shut it down(Even though he had a girlfriend and a baby at home).  \n\n\n\nMy wife and I started couples therapy about a month ago and just had our first appointment. We decided to go because we had many miscommunication problems that would cause fights or disagreements because neither of us could communicate to each other in the right way over the years. We would eventually come to an agreement but it would take days before anything would happen(I would stonewall, she would yell)  She said she was unhappy because of our communication problems and she felt like we were not growing together as of recently, so we agreed to seek counseling because neither of wanted to throw away our relationship. \n\n\n\nThe night after our first therapy session we went to dinner after so we could \"celebrate\" working together on our relationship. I had told her that her saying she was \"unhappy\" was constantly playing in my head. And it made me wonder if the therapy would even help, but I was willing to keep trying and doing the exercises the therapist wanted us to do. Fast forward to today, I come home from work and my wife is sitting there crying saying that she has to talk to me about something.  She tells me that a couple days after our appointment she went to get something fixed on her car(I can verify and it was definitely broke.). Anyways, she said the mechanic leaned into her and then kissed her and she kissed him back. At this point I am angry with her, saying that I trusted her and this is the second time this man has tried to make an advance on her. She said he attempted to text her multiple times after the appointment and she would immediately shut it down, (she was willing to show me any messages) and say that he cannot talk to her like that. He knows of me and knows that we are married. I asked her why she would even do that and she said she felt lost and that our relationship doomed to fail and over after I had told her that her saying she was \"unhappy\" was constantly playing in my head. \n\n  \nShe said she feels terrible and in that moment she doesn't even know why she did it and felt nothing. As a matter of fact, we've had sex multiple times since this occurrence. She decided to not bring it up right away because she wanted to pretend everything was normal and didn't want to put more strain on our relationship. She brought it up to me today because she felt like I had been working so hard on our relationship and everything finally felt \"normal between us\" and she has had this cloud looming over her head and feels guilty.  She was sobbing and crying the whole time she was telling me this  and she said she was so sorry and feels like shit. And nothing that I can say would be a bad as shes beating herself up in her head ; and wanted to let me know that it was nothing I did and it was her insecurities that lead to this.  She said she was scared to block him originally out of fear of retaliation as shes been victim to that before with Exes. I told her that it stupid of her to go back to this shop giving the circumstances and it all could have been avoided(Has her on zero social media, only text, has no idea where we live or work).  I am glad she told me, but at the same time I am torn and confused. Even if I we were in a bad phase of our relationship I would never reciprocate something like that.  I guess I don't know how to move on, I obviously love her. I want to be mad but I don't want to punish her either by shutting her out. We had a very long talk and at the end I told her for now I just needed some time to myself. ",

      "selftext": "This all started about 2 years ago when another woman’s husband contacted me after a work event a few months prior. He told me my husband and his wife were there drinking\nTogether and something bad happened. his wife told him my husband initiated it. They both denied it was anything more than a brief kiss and made him sound crazy, but it never sat right with me. Why go to such lengths to hide a little kiss? We fought and fought about it My husband swore it was nothing and that he never told me about it because it was so stupid he didn’t want me to flip out over something so small and meaningless. \n\nMonths later, while looking through an old phone for any clues, I accidentally found that a 21 year-old subordinate of his was blocked ( we are early 40’s) . That discovery made my stomach drop. I confronted him immediately (mistake, I know). He took quick action and confiscated the phone from me. And couldn’t believe I violated his privacy. I asked to see any texts between them and claimed he had to delete her texts because of a “glitch.” Around that time, I also discovered he had wiped his iCloud and even removed me as the account manager from our phone plan. When I confronted him, he gaslit me, saying that he didn’t even know how to block someone or  unsync his iCloud. He called me insane, and said if I brought it up again he would divorce me.\n\nFor the next year and a half, I begged and pleaded for the truth. I lost weight, saw a few different psychologists, and kept second-guessing myself while he insisted there was nothing and that I was jealous and insecure. He is a person whose entire personality is based in his integrity and the fact that I was questioning it made him so angry at me any time I tried to bring it up. I hit so many low points during this time, I actually started to believe him that I had made it all up in my head. I am a stay at home mom of 3 young kids. I have no money of my own and no where to go. I feel like I was never able to fully stand up for myself because I am so powerless. My low self worth kept me from demanding answers from him. I’ll always hate myself for that. Plus… I love him so much. He’s an incredible dad and person. thinking of being without him makes me want to die. \n\nThree months ago, I finally managed to get into our phone bill with him sitting next to me (pretending I was checking vacation charges). I found exactly what I feared: hours-long phone calls between him and the 21 year-old, lasting nearly a year. I never confronted him with this evidence. But I have combed through every single call and every single lie that was told during that time period. He has made me so scared to confront him about anything- I am afraid he would kick me out of our house if I tell him that I looked without permission. \n\nLast week, I told him I was asking for the truth one final time. I said I just couldn’t beg anymore and if he could find it in his heart to get honest so we could finally get to ground zero and start over. Well, Yesterday, he finally “confessed” — but only to what he calls a friendship that “sometimes crossed the line” and that they only talked at work. He admitted she sent him “nude photos ” and her sexting him but he didn’t reciprocate and they talked a lot through text and at work but never outside of work , but he insists nothing physical happened. He said he never found her attractive. He says it just happened out of no where and she got kind of obsessed with him and that’s why she was blocked bc she kept calling and texting him after work hours. he says he tried to end it several times but she would always do something to pull him back in and he was afraid she’d tell people at work because he’s the director there and he would lose his job so he kept going along with it. When I asked when the last time they spoke was (she got a new job) , he lied again— and I know because I still have the logs. We both cried and he promised to never lie to me again and that he was now being fully transparent. \n\nThe problem is… I don’t believe it was just emotional. Knowing my husband, and knowing this girl was very persistent- it doesn’t make sense that it wasn’t physical. But he insists I “have the truth now.”\n\nI don’t know how to move forward when I feel like there are still layers of lies. Has anyone been through something similar? How do you deal with never getting the full truth? What can I do to set a boundary and tell him that without the full truth reconciliation just isn’t possible. Could he be telling the truth?? I am so relieved that he finally told me but I’m also so confused on how to move forward. He has put me through the worst form of emotional torture I’ve ever been through. I want to  fix this but I cannot go through another 2 years of torment and trickle truths. \n",

      "selftext": "My husband (31M) and I (26F) have been together for 6 years, married for 2 (met in 2019). We had a few bumps in the road during our time of dating (infidelity: once for me, 4-5 times for him that I found out about) but in my opinion, it wasn’t too bad and everything was pretty good outside of the cheating. In Feb 2023, I found out I was pregnant 3 months before he was set to deploy to Kuwait, so we talked very in depth and decided to get married, which we did in April of that year. We went through the entire deployment with very little hiccups. I gave birth to a beautiful baby girl in Sept 2023 and my husband returned home April 2024. Everything was amazing, he was very loving and dedicated to being a great husband and father. But in July 2024 everything turned upside down.\n\nA family friend came to me in confidence and told me that she saw him on a dating app, so I confronted him about it. After many days of lying and having to go through his phone and an old phone of his, i finally got the entire truth. He not only was cheating on me overseas, he had been cheating all the way up until he left, sleeping with several different women, who at the time he was telling me were just good friends, and had even still been seeing a woman i had caught him with twice before. He cheated with another woman on my birthday and after we found out I was pregnant… I was completely devastated. But I chose to stay and try to work it out… we had a young child and I was scared to do it alone.. \n\nSince then, he has been great and doing everything in his power to dig himself out of this hole. There was one instance where he was texting a woman he has been known to cheat with before and planning to meet up, but both he and the woman said they never went through with it. He has been doing a great job as a husband , listening to me, taking the load of of me, not forcing nor demanding anything from me, just allowing me to move at my own pace and at my own time. He’s also stepped up even more as a father and has been phenomenal with our daughter.\n\nNow on to my problem now, it has been a little over 1 year since all of this happened but I have not gotten over it… and honestly, I don’t think I will. I have tried therapy, spending time with him, asking for space, having sex, not having sex, everything… but i still feel a drowning resentment towards him and it’s only getting worse. Just last month, I found out I was pregnant again and honestly, that seems to have been my last straw. I became depressed for about 2 weeks and when he finally confronted me about why I’ve been so down and detached… i admitted to him that I wanted a divorce. Now we are in the process of separating… but I’m not sure how I should be feeling. On one hand, I am very very relieved.. hate to say it but I’m happy.. the happiest I’ve been in a while.. I feel free to be myself and feel my feelings without the weight of his feelings and ego… but I feel terrible too because, as a Christian woman… i feel wrong for breaking up my family. My daughter absolutely loves her father… she looks forward to seeing him every single day, and this would mean going through yet another pregnancy alone, but this time by my own doing. I just would like for someone to tell me I’m doing the right thing… or I’m not. I just feel like it’s been over a year since this all happened, am I wrong for coming out of the blue asking for a divorce? Especially since he was under the impression that things were getting better?",

      "selftext": "Since finding out about my ex-fiancee's affair, I have been having a really hard time coping with it all. I have good days and bad days, sure, and being around people sure does help. But whenever I am alone, I break down heavy. The tightness in my chest doesn't go away no matter how hard I try. The only break I get is in the mornings when I first wake up. I still get nightmares at night, but if I manage to sleep through them and wake up naturally the next morning, I usually wake up groggy and not knowing where I am for a few seconds. Those few seconds are so peaceful... but then, I open my eyes and look around the room and realize where I am, in my childhood bedroom. Then, I realize why I am there, and all the emotion comes roaring back.\n\nThe hardest thing for me is that I know she's out there, she's unhappy. She's seeing her AP now because he \"treats her well and she enjoys spending time with him\" (her words, not mine). I just don't understand how she could have done this to me and how she could now leave me to pick up all the pieces on my own. Why did she have to do what she did, how could she have been so selfish? In reading some of the posts in various subreddits, some people don't get over it 10+ years down the line and I really don't want to end up one of those people. I want to heal and get better. I've been going to therapy and working on myself and have lost nearly 40 lbs now, but nothing seems to be enough. Nothing is making me happy.",

I can’t stop looking at videos and photos of his wedding. My brain keeps trying to convince me that this is real, that he’s married, and that I was deceived.\n\nUnlike most posts here, I’m not a willing affair partner. I had no idea he was married. I thought I was in a genuine relationship, but everything turned out to be a lie. The person I thought I knew never really existed. He used me, manipulated me, and ultimately blocked me. I never got a proper explanation.\n\nI feel completely crushed. I can’t get out of bed, I can’t eat, I can’t focus on work. Being discarded this way, without closure, is unbearable. I feel like my love and care meant nothing.\n\nHas anyone else been in a similar position as an unwilling AP, blindsided by the truth and then blocked? How did you cope with the ongoing pain and the feeling of being erased from someone’s life?",

He said he would continue with the wedding but he doesn’t know that I found out about the continuance of the affair these 2 weeks.\n\nI have a few paths in mind: \n1) Should I wait until he wires the second instalment of money to me, so as to minimize my financial loss, before I mention a break up?\n2) Should I just accept it is a total love and money loss for me, and break up now?\n3) Should I collect more evidence first and speak with his family?",

I have been seeing a therapist and it’s about a week before I see my psychiatrist again. I’m pretty positive the racing heart is an anxiety/CPTSD symptom, but at some point the added strain on the heart has got to be suboptimal. How concerned should I be about this? I assume it’s fine to wait another week to see the psychiatrist. Does anyone have any brilliant tips to calm a racing heart in the meantime?

      "selftext": "Both 29. This past weekend I found out my partner had a two week emotional affair with a tinder person. We’ve been dating for four years. After a bad argument, he downloaded Tinder and matched with her. They chatted to the point they were sexting and calling each other “baby 😘”\n\nMe? I was getting a cold two weeks. I thought he was processing the fight. While she was getting a good morning hope your day is magical as you, I wasn’t even getting a goodbye as he left to work. \n\nYet, we were still meeting up with our parents together. He was still cooking dinner. Some hand holding and what not. I did notice his kissing was off, but once again I thought processing the fight. \n\nA week before DDay I thought I saw tinder on his phone. I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt. But I got sooo much anxiety. Then I thought I saw him swiping. Thursday I made a fake account and found him. I was so upset I left our apartment for four hours to just cry in peace. \n\nFriday night I decided to snoop. I saw he matched with her and just read the messages. There was another girl he also gave his number too. But the main one he gave her his number and she didn’t respond. \n\nSaturday we were supposed to talk about what to do. Guess who messaged him that day. Guess who deleted Tinder. Two fucking weeks and he deleted Tinder for her but not his partner of 4 years. Once again I found out cause I snooped. I told her and he was mad at me 🙃\n\nI’m an idiot for wanting to stay with him. I love him so much. But I can’t get over the disrespect. I also asked him to show me his phone and he’s not. He doesn’t seem like he wants to do anything to build trust. How can you say you love me but not do anything to show it??\n\nI know I should leave, but I feel bad. Like I’m throwing everything away. I’m upset all the memories we have. I’ll have to take the dog since sharing seems pointless. Since the apartment is tied to my job, I want to quit and then move out of here to go back home to my parents. I’m just so tired and depressed I might just take a month or so off to just process everything. \n\nMy friend said maybe we can work it out. Do I really want to throw away four years? But I don’t think I can trust him especially since he’s not going anything to help. It fucking took him three days to delete the messages from his phone and blocked her. He still has her number saved as “‘nickName :)” when I asked him why he hadn’t blocked and deleted, he said “I don’t know, just haven’t.” He deleted messages and blocked her, but still has the contact. He stopped himself right before deleting and said he’s too tired.\n. \n\nI might be dramatic but I never want to date again. The idea that somebody did this to their partner of four years hurts me. We went ring shopping right before we got our puppy and before a big trip. Yet he downloaded dating apps because of a fight. Like why not break up with me?? \n\nThree out of four boyfriends cheated or lied to me. I just don’t want to date again. I feel I’ll never trust anybody. I thought he was the one but he looked for validation from others.  \n",

Anyways, yesterday would’ve been our 4 year anniversary and yes I took it hard. Bc a profile on Tik Tok I started paying attention to, had been watching me a lot on the views. So I decided to check for the one time and see the AP on her profile saying sth along the lines of “Imagine being mad at me and throwing shade like it was my fault. He decided to move on!”. Like ok you’re watching my reposts bc I’ve blocked you both since seeing you two back together (I believe I mentioned this in my last post?) and that’s where I’m reposting videos of my situation, all on Tik Tok of course I forgot to mention. Anyway our mutual friends all have decided to be done with him after he lied about to why he didn’t show up to our friend’s wedding (spoiler alert he was with her and lied saying he was sick and had car issues), and yeah. It makes me very bothered she feels the need to basically point and laugh at my pain (when she’s seeing my reposts, either her or him), when she has him! Like girl you got what you wanted! Why do you still feel the need to make fun of me for having emotions about being cheated on and him going to you not even a month into me officially leaving him? Anyways, yesterday i emotionally broke down badly, and i was sobbing to my mom how i hate being at my apartment (we had shared it but i kicked him out since the break up), but i also like that i get to be here to be alone with my dog and bed rot and/or watch videos to help me distract myself. I feel like a whole wave of emotions and can’t wait to finally move from this place. I’ve noticed also, and I’ve point this to my therapist, I’ve developed a lot of hatred and anger towards both of them. They get to be happy together while I struggle to eat some days and struggle to even want to do any daily things I have to do.

      "selftext": "\n\nMy ex bf and I were together for 5 years. His brother passed away December 29 2024 leaving behind two kids and a gf. I don’t know what happened with my ex in January and February but he became very close with the girlfriend (they’ve been friends for years) and he was teaching her to drive and also just being there for her since they both were off from work. I was aware and allowed them to be around each other because they knew each other for years and he wanted to be there for his nephews. In January his behavior was normal then everything changed in February. He became cold and distant and a little mean. I had a feeling something was going on. I saw both of them often and she was always nice to my face she never said anything to me. Turns out they slept together on her birthday which was in February an the day after I saw them both and they didn’t say anything to me. She was giving me dirty looks but I didn’t think much of it. \n\nAt this point I still didn’t know anything and she was still around us. In March he became worse and I felt like he was pushing me away. So we decided to take a break to figure things out. Within that week I saw he was already taking her and the kids out to eat and to the movies and he was buying blue chews. This made my suspicion grow. I confronted him and he denied it. Another time I called him and heard her in the background. He said they were just hanging out. Another time I called him and she was with him again. All this time she never told me anything. One night they wee together I guess they hooked up and she called me from his phone to tell me that they’re sleeping together and that he’s lying to me and that he told her he wanted to be with her. She was basically happy about it because he chose her. Couple other times she would text me from his phone telling me to leave him alone. Or from her Facebook she would tell me to leave her “man” alone. I was so lost because this was a long term relationship we were in and he’s allowing her to act like this. \n\nShe was telling people that he was her fiance without him knowing as well. My thing is I’m so conflicted because why would someone do this. I know he’s the one that’s wrong and I blame him 1000% percent. But I also blame her since she knew me for five years and knew him and I had a relationship going an honestly I think maybe she was jealous in some sense or she just simply wanted to help him ruin his relationship. I know everyone says to not blame the girl always blame the guy but I think in this situation I have to point two fingers. I’m trying to make sense of everything still. I also find it insane that all of this happened two months after his brother and her baby daddy died. This all happened a month after we talked about settling down as well. ",

Found out she was cheating when she was with the other guy by him literally broadcasting it on Facebook and it showed up on her feed. Funny thing, during the breakup, I laughed more than anything. If you're gonna cheat was thinking she was gonna be more discreet about it. Some time passed, I got back into some hobbies and into some meetup groups. I started learning French again, my main passion.\n\nI've recently met someone new at a French language meetup group and we've been going on a series of dates since with a few intimate encounters. And I never anticipated how dating after this would be so difficult. The new woman (25F) has been really great. Consistent, crystal clear on communication and everything she says lines up with what she does. In the beginning, everything I was riding an emotional high, but then ghost of the past rears its ugly head when I'm alone thinking that something about her is just too good to be true. It all starts out well, until it isn't. \n\nThen I'll find myself rewinding to conversations and try to spot moments where certain things don't add up. This isn't the first time it's happened and I can say that I've become somewhat skeptical of anyone remotely interested in me. I never mentioned this to her directly. Well, she never really knows my true thoughts (I don't feel too comfortable opening up).\n\nHas anyone dealt with or is dealing with this? What tools do you use to give someone a chance? I really do like having her around.\n\n",

He stole so much time from me and the worst part I found out he cheated with men and woman, couples, any and every where. No protection. Public places with random strangers. Some he paid some paid him. And let’s not forget the escorts - trans, fem and male. It’s all so overwhelming 💔\n\nI just need words of encouragement to mae it through tomorrow.

This morning, he was tending to our baby girl and left his phone on his bedside. We have a neighborhood Snapchat group and I opened it to send a funny picture when I saw he had an unread chat from a girl, we’ll call her Laurie. This specific chat between him and Laurie was set to mute all notifications, however she had the 😊 best friend emoji beside her name, which I found suspicious so I opened it. I found messages upon messages saved between them pretty much throughout our relationship. The worst ones are from 2018-2020, where messaged her to vent about me when we would get into an argument, he sexted her, he told her he has feelings for her that “will never change” and he’s “always wondered what it would be like to be with her.” At one point, she asks him to sneak away to her town for the weekend and to make up a lie to get out. Then, several weeks later she sends “HERE” which I’m assuming was a physical meetup. We were not married then, but had been together for 5 years. The saved messages taper off around 2021, where I see on Facebook that she got married and had a baby around that time. There aren’t any saved messages after 2021. However, she’s still marked as best friends on snap with him and he had her chats muted and an unread one from her that she sent this month. \n\nI have not confronted him yet. My question is - how do I go about this? What do I do? ",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nSorry if this is a long and confusing post. I’m very emotional right now and need advice.\n\nI (F25) and my husband (M28) have been together since I was 14. During all these years we have been long distance because of his work as an athlete and me focusing on getting my education in a different country. We were incredibly young and in love during all these years, and have truly had an amazing connection for most of the relationship.\n\nIn the years 2018–2020, we experienced some hardships because of the distance. I think we both “checked out” mentally during this time because of our constant fights and lack of effort. I was starting college, meeting new people, and gaining new interests. During this time, we both started talking to other people online. He caught me flirting and having fun conversations with another guy I had randomly connected with on social media. I never met the guy, but it was still wrong. He found out, and we decided to work on our relationship because we felt it was worth fighting for.\n\nFast forward to 2022, we still hadn’t fully worked things out, but after a long talk we decided we only wanted each other. I felt terrible for giving attention to someone else, but he convinced me that he had never broken my trust. He proposed in 2022, and we got engaged. Just before this, we decided to “start fresh” and move on as new and committed people. We had a small religious ceremony (not a full wedding) so that our relationship would be valid in the eyes of God.\n\nIn February 2025, I found old messages on his phone with girls he had been texting during the corona years, along with evidence like Tinder from 2019–2021. When I confronted him, he swore he never met up with them and it was just online talking because he was “checked out” like I had been. I decided to look past it, thinking how could I blame him for making the same mistake I did?\n\nBut two days ago, I followed my instinct and looked up some names from his blocked list. I discovered girls who lived in the same place he did in 2020. When I confronted him again, he confessed to much more than I had ever imagined. He admitted to having sex with two girls in 2020 and receiving oral from another. My world fell apart.\n\nThe painful part is that after we decided to “start fresh” in 2022, our relationship has been amazing. He has been such a loving and supportive partner, especially after we got married. Our relationship has never been better than it is right now, which makes it so hard to process this. He says it was a dark time in his life, that he’s remorseful, and that he has changed since then.\n\nI’m supposed to move countries in a week to be with him, and I’m devastated to have just found this out now — especially since things were going so well. I feel like not only my marriage, but all the years together have been a lie. We were each other’s first love, and I always thought he would be my last. We’ve even been talking about having kids soon.\n\nIs there any reason why I should try to push past this and accept that it happened before we got married? Or am I stupid for even giving that a thought?",

      "selftext": "\nI spent my entire life with one woman fresh out of high school. 12 years.  Love at first sight. Moved in immediately. Happiest I had ever been. Never thought of it being any other way.\n\n\nIt was great at first but ran into some issues that in hindsight were minor for an early relationship but piled up over time. I stupidly signed up for a dating site. She kissed one of my friends. Maybe a few texts from guys on her phone but nothing ever concrete. We were teenagers but convinced to make it work and we did for a while.\n\n\nI got severely depressed over time. I think it rubbed off on her. Sex started to dwindle to basically nothing. I started to resent her and lash out and was emotionally abusive. I got fat and comfortable. She gained some weight too but nothing in comparison. She always looked like the first day I met her. She was a trooper and stuck it out so long and I always appreciated that.\n\n\n I still loved her. Even more in the later years. I guess in my mind life without her just didn’t exist. I was deep. So I took it for granted. Didn’t propose in a timely manner. Should’ve started a family. A lot of embarrassment and resentment from her there rightfully so. \n\n\nI don’t blame her for the moment it all changed. She was starved for emotional connection and found it with people online. I knew and confronted her. She told me it was nothing but I had a clue. I snooped and found what I consider enough and sent her to her parents house so we could have some space.\n\n\nLittle did I know she was already confessing love for someone else and immediately went and slept with him and decided to continue that relationship. I was distraught but ultimately I understood why. It took me a while though. She deserved happiness and I just wasn’t the same person anymore. I needed to grow and change and had to do it in my own. \n\n\nSo we fully separated. I moved to a new city and she moved to her parents and continued seeing this guy. I’ll admit after a long and sexless relationship I kind of went out of control. I wanted to fill the void in my heart but couldn’t find the same love so I filled it with sex instead. Ended up sleeping with about 6 or 7 women over the course of a year. \n\nI came around eventually. Started working on my inner self and realized what was important in life. I reached out to my ex and tried to make amends and possibly reconnect. It went well. We made serious progress. \n\nAfter 14 months of not seeing each other we planned a trip. Nothing extravagant. I thought it was more important to just spend time together and go on small dates and really put the effort into exploring each others feelings and making a strong foundation for the future. I had her stay at my home.\n\n\nBrings me to today. A week ago I brought her to a bar to watch football. To be honest it was hard to completely let go and have fun with all the unresolved feelings. I was a little mean. She ended up shooting the shit with some guy at the bar.\n\n\nA few days later I start seeing a local number texting her. I confronted her but she’s not my girlfriend so I did so calmly and explained my feelings. She said she didn’t know who it was. That I was being crazy. So I let it go.\n\n\nWhile she was staying at my house I come home from work a little early one night and she’s not there. Nowhere to be found. Not really answering me directly. At the point I figured what was going on and lashed out. She never came home. \n\n\nAt 5am I called her dad to tell him I was worried for her safety. He gave me her location and I went to go find her to make sure she was ok. Well she was at that guys house from the bar and they fooled around. She claims they didn’t have sex but yeah ok. That I should forgive her and it was my fault because I was being mean and controlling. \n\n\nI bagged up her stuff and left it on the curb. I was crushed. 14 months of growing and talking and repairing for this to happen. I felt so ashamed and belittled. I spent my time money and effort on a woman I love just for her to give herself to some random guy she met at the bar a few days earlier. \n\n\nShe claims she couldn’t get over how I was treating her. That she wasn’t truly healed over the amount of women I slept with. That her actions were justified and I should just get over it. That I was being immature. That it could still work.  She claims I’m overreacting completely and ruining any chance.\n\n\nI just don’t think I can ever get over the humiliation. The amount of disrespect it would take for someone to do that. I’m sitting here writing this and it just feels so unreal. I’m not mad or sad. I’m not angry. Just numb.\n\n\nIt’s hard to know where to go from here. Im pissed and relieved at the same time I guess. I’m glad if it was going to happen it was now on the first trip. I never really closed that chapter with her but I guess now it’s time. \n\n\nI would love to hear your opinion on this. I think I know I have to let it go now but it’s so hard. Maybe it was my fault? Maybe I did push a little too much instead of living in the moment? How could it possibly work after this?\n\n\n",

      "selftext": "Not sure where to go with this, long story, I'll yet to condense it.  Wife (55f) and I (50m) hanger been together, happily, for 13yrs.\n\n5 years ago, wife reconnected with an old friend from high school.  They started talking, texting, CONSTANTLY. Alll day, every day.   If he didn't talk to her for some reason, she would spiral into a funk.  After about a month of talking, she started having him over every other weekend (her lives 3hrs away, and would stay the weekend in a spare bedroom).\n\nNaturally, I'm becoming suspicious, but my wife gave no indications that something was going on, relations between us were still great. \n\nAfter a bit of this, I started noticing how excited she'd become when he called, or was coming over.   This started setting off alarm bells, and I brought it up to her.   She dismissed it, saying that they're just friends and she doesn't look at him \"like that\", he's \"like a brother\" to her. \n\nI let it go as, again, there were no other signs... things between us were great, and she seemed genuinely concerned for how i felt. \n\nShe calls me one day to tell me she offered to talk him on a trip home for a week, so he could see his dying dad (he couldn't afford to go on his own).  She offered this without asking how I felt about it, and you can imagine how I reacted to that.   So that started another discussion about their relationship.   She apologized for not asking me first, but she'd already offered and he accepted... so it was on.   She then wanted me to go as well, to try to make up. \n\nSo, this goes on for a few months, until a couple weeks before the trip, when he unexpectedly passes away. \n\nNot going to lie, I was a bit relieved when he was gone.  She was devastated, grieved for over a year. \n\nFast forward 4 years, something came up that brought up how I felt about their relationship, and she reiterated how she wasn't interested him in that way, and wouldn't have been with him even if we weren't together.  This didn't sit right with me, as her behavior didn't match what she was saying.  The were always hugging, touching, telling each other they loved each other, etc. \n\nSo, I went hunting for the truth.  Nothing on her phone,  not many texts,... messages were deleted (they texted 100's of times a day,  literally).  And found nothing else. \n\nThen I remembered she had a different phone back then, that we still had.   Found it, powered it up, and looked there.  In there i found texts that said how she really felt, she was in love with him, wanted to be with him, and a whole bunch more, to the point where I'm almost positive they were physical as well, but no proof. \n\nThis was like a gut punch, as what she said in the texts matched her behavior and what I was seeing. \n\nHere's my issue, the guys dead... and things have been great since (only weren't great while she was grieving).  But I can't let it go, been a year and it's still on my mind all the time.  She lied to me about him for years, and that affects me. \n\nAm I overreacting?  Should I stuck it up and deal with it, or confront her and risk the relationship? \n\nI keep going back and forth,  any advise??",

      "title": "How do I move forward",
      "selftext": "My 28M girlfriend 24F of 2 years cheated and I don't know how to move forward. \n\nWe met two years ago. She is the sweetest woman in the world. We had a long distance relationship for 1 year. Everything was great. We didn't argue. Our goals aligned. We wanted the same things out of life. She wanted to be a stay at home mom eventually and I wanted to provide. In the meantime, I encouraged her to enjoy hobbies and stuff before we have children or get married or anything. \n\nWe moved together after a year and everything was going great. She was occasionally angry and then happy and then sad. One second to the next could be different. I wanted her to see a psychiatrist but she never did. I think she was scared. But I reassured her that I'm here for her. \n\nThen we got into a car accident and the trauma triggered something. It got much worse. She could be snuggling with me, and then the next minute, shed get up and start beating me. Id never been in that situation and I tried to get her help. But she would never go to appointments. Then she started accusing me of stuff I never did, she accused me of cheating and swore she knew I was. But Im loyal. She's all I ever needed so I have no reason to cheat. \n\nFast forward a few months and I realized she was having hallucinations. Auditory and visual. So in her mind, I actually was cheating. She truly believed I was. She also truly believed I was being mean or abusive. When in reality, it was the other way around.\n\nI found out she had been seeing out neighbor and texting him, photos, nudes, etc. By this point she wasn't talking to me. She wasn't talking to her parents. And honestly she was barely talking to this guy. She seemed like mentally, she was 6 years old. It was a lot to deal with. She was acting like a 6 year old with her manerisms, communication, etc. so for a few months, while I was trying to get her help, I didn't feel comfortable having sex with her. I felt that she couldn't consent. She was a shell of herself. the abuse and hallucination were every day. So I asked her to please admit herself to the behavioural hospital. She did. I also found out from the guy she was talking to that they had sex. He was an asshole. He said he just wanted to use her. Told me to move on. I explained that I didn't even feel like she could consent. He claimed he had no idea. Said he thought she was just normal and tried to make me feel like her acting like she was a child was all in my head. But I had seen texts and she was literally texting like a child. \n\nThe behavioral hospital said she's been in a manic episode since the car accident. That she is bipolar and that's what caused the episodes. That it spiraled quickly. And that she technically could consent legally. The doctor said morally, she couldn't consent because she wasn't in her right mind. To find a place in my heart to forgive her. \n\nShe'll be out sooner than I thought. She's coming home in a week. How do I ever have sex with her again without thinking of that guy. She's the most beautiful girl in the world to me. We did have a great sex life prior to this. She says she still loves me. And when I visit, she seems like her old self. I haven't brought up the cheating when I visit her in the hospital. I just want her to get better. \n\nI don't want to make her life miserable by letting it ruin sex for us. \n\n\n\nSo my issue is that most people cheat while mentally healthy. She was not mentally there. Hell I couldn't even feel good about having sex with her because she had the mannerisms of a child and I respect her as a person as well as myself. So I couldn't do it. And she said the reason why she cheated is because she truly believed I was cheating on her. The hallucinations made it seem real. \n\nHow do I move past this and not let it ruin me, our sex life, etc. \n\nI also want to note that it's not just about sex. I feel like I can't trust her. I used to work 18 hour days and I never thought twice about her cheating. I never expected it. I feel betrayed. I feel used. I feel hurt. I feel like less of a man because I accepted her beating me every single day while I tried to vet her help. My ear is permanently damaged. My nose is fractured. She destroyed everything I own. Even a guitar that I got from my dad when I was a kid. It was the last thing I physically had to remember him. It was very important to me. \n\nI don't know how to rebuild trust. I know we need therapy. I'm in the middle of building us a tiny house with a kitchen and bathroom and everything built in. But I've been lazy with the construction because I'm so hurt. I worry she'll keep doing things behind my back. But I truly hope that the cheating was because of the manic episodes. ",

Nurses??? \n\nFunny thing is I used to be sooo thin. Like unhealthy. But I was 18. I’ve had kids. So why am I now comparing my curvy, grownup body to my 18yo one? She’s younger. No kids. But I’m just remembering how tiny and perky I used to be just like her when WH and I first met. \nGoing online and seeing skinny women IN GENERAL is now a trigger and I used to be all about body positivity and now it’s like this internal hatred and I absolutely hate that I’ve become so insecure. \n2. The trigger stems from him trying to put me in flexible positions and it disgusts me. Never have been and never will be. It was never confirmed if they were intimate before D-day ofc he denies it but ugh it’s like a knife in my heart whenever I see anyone on social media doing anything related to gymnastics or being flexible. \nAnd now…\n3. Nurses?!?!? Him and AP are both nurses. Well LPN/BSN which don’t even get me started on him deciding to get his BSN because of her even though he had other hopes and dreams of his career. But ANYWAY. I literally work with nurses. It’s legit apart of my job. So going to work and seeing my female coworkers is a trigger??? Be so serious right now. \n\nI feel stupid. I feel alone. I feel like this is all so ridiculous. I’ve tried going to therapy for this and honestly gave up after a couple of sessions. I’ve been in and out of therapy for years. Childhood trauma, personal growth, I was doing so well. Now more trauma and idk if I can handle it right now. \n\nIdk when I’ll be ready there’s so much going on that 1. I genuinely don’t have time to sit through sessions. I barely have time to make it to doctor appointments. All I do is work, come home, have my 50/50 days and I have no family support so it’s all on me. Working through the separation logistics and everything… ugh. Im depleted. ",

Its difficult to imagine my life without her after so many years together but I can’t forgive that she would cheat on me with a guy, also not knowing she was bi and give out her number to guys at parties etc (not sure if him was first but I am now paranoid that it was not the first time).

That was DDay1.\n\nDday2 came four weeks later, when I responded to people texting him from unknown numbers. That’s when even more lies and betrayals surfaced - this time it was a MUCH older woman who had been involved with him for the entire duration I had been with him.\n\nWhat made this worse was the timing. I lost my job days before Dday 1. The stress and trauma of discovery have made finding new work extremely difficult, and it’s left me feeling financially trapped on top of everything else. It has totally killed my confidence, and everything I thought I knew about myself even professionally.\n\nIt’s now been 17 months since the first discovery. He still refuses to talk about it, refuses to disclose details of his affairs, and yet expects me to stay faithful and not leave.\n\nLiterally everything falls on me - paying the bills, household chores, trying to play his game of “forgive and forget, and be a good quiet girl” has just left me feeling so stuck - 23 years of my life invested, no financial independence right now, and still met with stonewalling and excuses\n\nHas anyone else had to deal with the double-hit of betrayal and financial dependency? How did you manage to get unstuck and move forward when your partner refused to take any responsibility?

      "selftext": "so i’m going to keep my insanely long story short. in april, my husband was diagnosed with total kidney failure after being otherwise totally healthy and it was a huge hit to both of us. he was extremely blessed and got a transplant this past month, but days before we were set to leave for this transplant 2 states away, i found out he was having an emotional affair with a coworker. i wanted to work it out because we’ve been together since we were kids and he truly is my best friend and has always been a great husband. i honestly chalked a lot of it up to the huge stress and change in our lives causing him to act out. i know there’s no excuse, but i had to reconcile it in my mind to get through this transplant trip and start rebuilding our relationship. while we were still out of state, he started texting her again after she called to find out how he was. i caught on quick and he broke down, so i tried to forgive him again but my guard was even higher up and i felt myself getting more apathetic.\n\nsince we got back to town this past weekend, i thought everything was going better. we start therapy next week, both individual and marriage. but then last night i got back his snapchat data and found out he’s been doing… something? for years. he did admit to me during this argument that he has sent and received pictures from a girl while he was in college from this situation but swears it was the only time. but what he’s been doing is something i can’t wrap my brain around. basically, he adds random women off of the snapchat quick add feature and just snaps back and forth with them. usually they don’t even talk, just snap pics back and forth. i confirmed this with one of the accounts i could go back and look at the previous pictures of. he says he doesn’t even know why he does it, but he’s done it our whole relationship, even up until last week. i truly just don’t know what to do in this situation. it’s not cheating, but it’s obviously not nothing. has anyone else dealt with something like this? he says he loves me more than anything and wants to fix everything. that he feels so stupid and angry with himself. and, probably stupidly and naively, i believe him. this is someone i’ve known my whole life and loved for 8 years.\n\ni don’t know if im looking for advice or support, just would like to hear some outside perspective. i’m truly hoping the therapy will help when it starts, but im just feeling so broken and alone right now.",

      "selftext": "My husband cheated on me and I’ve found out again and again that he kept in touch with his AP while he pretended to reconcile. He has admitted to me that he has feelings for her He also says he doesn’t want to be with me anymore, not just because of her, but because he believes we aren’t good together and our marriage cant be saved. \n\nThe thing is, I keep holding on. I tell him that I never knew he was so emotionally distant in our marriage. I never got a chance to work on it. I believe what we had was good - we had a good marriage, we were both respectful, likes each spending time together, did everything together (at least in my eyes). He says he love me but platonically. What does that even mean? He says that’s because he “took care of me well,” amd he wanted me to be happy, which may be true, but I didn’t feel like anything was missing until this blew up.\n\nMy friends keep asking me about self-respect. Even I question it. Why do I keep going back to someone who clearly says he doesn’t want me anymore? Why do I still want to fight for this marriage when he’s already checked out?\n\nSome part of me thinks it’s familiarity, he’s the only person I’ve known and built a life with. Some part of me thinks it’s my faith and my church community encouraging me to hold on and not give up. And some part of me genuinely loves him, even if he doesn’t love me back in the same way.\n\nI can’t even imagine him being with his AP, it breaks me. He says he is not leaving for her. Then why cant he stay and give the marriage a chance? But at the same time, I don’t know if I’m fighting for the marriage itself or just terrified of letting go, I am scared of change.\n\nWhy do I keep going back even though he keeps rejecting me? Is this love, or just fear of change and loneliness? He has betrayed me in multiple ways. How do I know if this is about him… or about me not being able to let go?",

So yesterday, my husband took us all to an Astros game. Everything was going fine at first, but then I started feeling really triggered.\n\nI kept noticing women in the crowd who looked a lot like the person my husband had an affair with, and that just brought back a flood of anxiety. It’s been almost a year since I found out about it, and I’ve been trying so hard to move forward and forgive, but moments like this just knock me back.\n\nOn top of that, I had recently seen a TikTok video of a baseball player’s wife saying how she trusts her husband completely and never worries about infidelity. Watching that video made me realize how I used to feel the same way, and now I can never go back to that place of blind trust. It’s like I’ve been robbed of that sense of security.\n\nAnyway, I just wanted to share and maybe find some support or just let it out. Thanks for reading.\n",

We have been together for 13 years and have two kids. I have been constantly accused of being unfaithful no matter what I do. I have even been choked because he was suspicious, no evidence, just suspicious. I've had so many personal items destroyed and holes in my walls because of nothing but suspicion. He refuses to leave and still expects intimacy. It is taking a lot in me not to hurt him so he can never harm anyone else. So I have gone back to drinking heavy to cope.

Anyway. \n\nThe house is in both of our name, and our little kids LOVE our home, so I moved to an apartment so they had stability (we are like 60/40 custody ish, she has the most of the time) We agreed to just hold the house indefinitely until something causes us to think of selling it or she no longer wants to live there. \n\nShe mentions an upcoming plan to host a group of friends that I know is same circle as AP. I ask simply if she’s inviting him over, and she said she was thinking about it. \n\nI am at a point where I have accepted (though still with trouble and grief) that she is making her own decisions and I can’t control or focus on those—only my own health and decisions and healing. \n\nSo do I do the same here? Accept that she has the freedom and choice to bring him (or whoever, for that matter) since it’s her house too and she lives there and it’s what we agreed?

      "selftext": "I (26F) knew something had been off with my gf (25F) for about a week before she approached me about taking a break in our relationship. For a little background, she is big into online gaming and has always played with friends she met online and talked to on discord. I’ve never suspected anything at all, as we shared a game room and I never felt she was being weird or secretive about who she was playing with or what they talked about.\n\nWell, that kinda started to change when she told me she had met a few Chinese girls who invited her to talk on WeChat about 3 months ago. After that, everything changed pretty fast. She was constantly texting on WeChat, going to the other room for long periods of time just to be on her phone, staying up literally all night every weekend (she says she’s just gaming with friends), seeming distant, all the usual stuff that you feel in your gut something is going on. The same day I was prepared to confront her about it, she actually beat me to it and told me she thought we needed a break. I heard her out on issues she brought up, but because of the way she had been acting I straight up asked her if there was someone else as the reason she really wanted the break. She said “no, why would there be someone else?” \n\nAbout 2 weeks into the break (still living together but staying in different rooms) I saw an application for a passport sticking out of her lunchbox on the kitchen table. A few days later, I overheard her having a sexual conversation with a girl on FaceTime and confronted her. It was one of the Chinese girls she had met online. She immediately denied that she started anything romantic / sexual until after the break. She was caught off guard when I brought up the passport and didn’t say anything except to accuse me of going through her stuff. She then blamed me being away at my moms a few days a week during our break as the reason she suddenly needed to turn to this girl. We broke up. I didn’t believe any of it. When I cried and asked her why she couldn’t just be honest with me from the beginning, she laughed and said “I don’t know what to tell you.” She was so cold and indifferent to me it was hard to believe she had once been my girlfriend honestly. \n\nShe has since turned in her passport application and admitted to me she might go see her. She even threw out the idea of selling all of her stuff and going to China for a while, and with the way she has been working insane overtime and suggesting that she will be quitting her job within the year, I believe her. She said she knows she won’t be able to stay there forever, but she is willing to figure it out as she goes I guess. I noticed she stays on the phone with this girl nearly all day (within ear shot of me mind you, so I have to hear it all), even when one of them is sleeping. She burns through her pto and calls in to work due to what I can only assume is her staying up for this girl. She told me her job even gave her a warning due to her poor attendance but that she “didnt even care at this point.” I have no idea why she tells me all this information, I think she just needs to vent, and I’m so nosy about what the hell is going on that I listen. Part of me is worried about her moving so fast with no regard to anything, even though I hate her for hurting me so badly with no remorse. \n\nI’m both heartbroken and just shocked by everything. To be cheated on is one thing, but for it to be like this is insane. Not to mention this was my first ever serious relationship. Im still reeling from it 3 weeks post breakup, all of it made worse by the fact I can’t move out for another 3. Has anyone ever dealt with anything like this? What do you make of it? ",

      "selftext": "I have been divorced for seven years and I was with my high school sweetheart for over 20 years, married for 15. We had two amazing children. \n\nAbout 5 years into my marriage, I started to get that feeling he was cheating. I would catch him in small lies, he would come home drunk and smell like perfume, he would flirt with anybody and everybody. The list goes on and on. I confronted him about my suspicions and he did a very good job making me feel like these were my issues and I was just insecure. I even ended up going to therapy and convinced myself that I needed to be more trusting and laid back. Well, fast forward and I find out that he is having a long-term affair with one of my best friends. And he had several flings along the way. I was devastated. I felt like I wasted my life on a lie and a true asshole. \n\nWe got a divorce and have coparented well. The first few years were rough because he very much went thru a wild party phase. He met his now wife in 2020, she is 15 years younger than him. She is honestly lovely but extremely naive. We have become friendly and talk at kids events and holidays. My brother died recently and she showed up at my house with a care basket and flowers. He doesn’t deserve her. \n\nHowever, when they first started dating he would still message me and try to flirt and ask for nudes. I never provided them. We still have mutual friends and I have heard through them that he messes around with women while she travels for work. I have stayed out of it because I am the ex and I haven’t had direct evidence. A few months back we were with my kids making cookies. She started to confide in me. She came home early and found one of his coworkers in their house. She told me she was very uncomfortable with their friendship. They text and talk on the phone all the time. She also asked to spend time with them and he told her that the other woman wouldn’t like that. My kids were there so, I just tried to give good advice but discreetly and told her to follow her gut. If it doesn’t feel right, it probably isn’t.\n\nSo here is where I need advice. Last night, I was at a restaurant with friends and I looked over and he was at the bar with this woman that she is not comfortable with. It was just the two of them and it clearly appeared like a date. I didn’t see them do anything but they were drinking together and left. He ran into our friends on the way out so he knew he was caught. They said he was like a deer in the headlights and started getting fidgety. I don’t believe he saw me because I was still at the table. I left about 15 min later and saw them sitting in her car at the back of the parking lot. And I just left. \n\nSo, my dilemma is… do I tell her? I feel like girl code says I should but we aren’t close like that. Also, my ex is an extremely skilled liar and I am sure he already has something in the hopper because he knows he was seen. I am so torn.",

      "selftext": "My ex husband and I have a long, complicated history. We were together for 15 years. From the start, we lived together, then later got married. Our relationship was not easy. There was emotional and physical abuse, and many times I should have left sooner. In 2011, I caught him with one of his ex's in our home after I found out he was texting an having an affair with a woman at work. He swore nothing happened, but what I walked in on told me otherwise. I was devastated, but I still took him back.\n\nFast forward: we separated and lived apart but continued seeing each other on and off for about two years after marriage. I finally divorced him in 2024, but even after divorce we still keep contact, spending time together here and there. A part of me always held onto the hope that he would change and we could reconcile.\n\nJust two weekends ago, he took me out for my birthday. He has talked about “when we get back together” and even wanting to get a house for us. He’s always reaching out, trying to see me. I thought maybe, slowly, he was showing me he could change.\n\nThen recently, I saw a picture that made it clear he was at that same woman’s house, the one from 2011. When I confronted him, he denied it and said it was “nothing.” His excuse was that he only went there because she can get cheap drugs (adderall, weed) through her son and it’s some kind of connection through his work friends. That he goes there to get it for his friends. To me, it sounds like a cover up, and I don’t believe him.\n\nWhen I pressed, he told me he doesn’t want her, that he only wants me, that it’s always been me. But I told him I feel betrayed and can’t trust him, not after everything that’s happened, not after all the lies and pain. I don’t believe his explanation, and even if it *were* true, it’s still crossing a boundary and reopening trauma that’s already there.\n\nI feel beyond devastated. This woman has been a trigger and source of trauma for me since 2011, and I can’t believe after everything, after me giving him chance after chance, even after divorce, he’d still go near her, let alone lie to me about it.\n\nI know we’re not officially together, but we have been spending time, being intimate, and even talking about the future. I truly had hope for reconciliation, and now I feel shattered all over again.\n\nAm I wrong to feel betrayed here? How do I process this? I feel numb, heartbroken, and like I can never trust him again. I don’t even know what to do. I just need advice, because I feel so broken.\n\nI can't stop crying uncontrollably. ",

My wife has shown very little remorse or attempts to try and fix things between us. She is not transparent about details (past situations I was lied to while she was having the affair.) She still continues to hide her phone, keeps location turned off, and not changing her mindset at all to make this work.\n\nAll she says is, “we have to try and make this work for our two kids.” Other than her family, I have no family close to help take care of our little girls. My heart and gut tell me that I can never forgive her ever again. Also, I can never live with the peace of wondering what my wife is doing.

We have Life 360 on all phones in the family to keep track of our kids, but other than that, I haven’t “spied” on him in years, no looking at his phone, emails, texts, etc. \n\nLast week he was supposed to pick up one of the kids from an evening activity. He volunteered days before to do this and reminded me the day of.  The activity ended early and our son tried texting and calling him with no answer. Son called me then asking where dad was. Life 360 showed him at church, which is where he said he’d be, doing yard work with another guy until it was time to pick up our son. I went to pick up son after also failing to get in touch with husband.\n\nHusband finally called me back and said he was on the way to pick up son. So clearly he only read a couple of the texts. I could tell from his voice that he was doing something physical while talking to me. The app showed he was at a gas station at this time.  I told him i already did that and asked where he had been. He first stuck with original story. I just kept saying “ you’re lying” to him. His story changed several times…where he was, what he was doing, and who he was with. He eventually stuck with the story that he was by himself at a warehouse his former employer owns, clearing his head and he accidentally left his phone at church. He was gone for 3 hours. Denies cheating and purposely leaving phone/altering location in any way. \n\nI don’t believe him. If he forgot his phone, he would have gone back right away. He came in gardening clothes (he changed into them at the gas station). Why would he do that if not trying to deceive me? And he is alone plenty due to his work schedule so he had all day to clear his head. He certainly didn’t need an elaborate plan to do this. And why keep changing his story when caught in the lie?\n\nThere’s no innocent explanation right? I was dumb and let my guard down and it blew up in my face yet again. I’m so angry and disappointed. I think I’m done. It’s been 20 years of hoping for a change that doesn’t seem possible. He’s on his best behavior now, but sticking to his ridiculous story. I just can’t believe it’s the truth. I’m not crazy thinking he’s cheating am I? What do I do now?",

      "selftext": "In 2018, my wife began a two year long affair with my best friend.  It was her fifth affair in our 7 year marriage.  It tore me apart, just like everyone else.  I don’t know why I stayed, I say I did it for my two young daughters, and for my promise to God at our wedding.  I am a Christian and know the bible says infidelity is grounds for divorce but that were called to love one another and forgive one another.  So I went with that.  I didn’t find out until september/october of 2020 after she moved out in August.  The weeks she didn’t use our daughters, she spent with the other guy.  I’m ashamed to say we were ever even friends, he was a jerk… and sent me pictures and videos of them together in hopes it would make me want to leave her.  \n\nShe came home in December and we began a super long journey to where we are.  I spent two years in talk therapy and another two years in EMDR.  I drank myself numb in hopes the memories would go away.  My wife was patient with me for a year or so.  Then she began to lose that grace she was giving me for my hard days.  So I realized I had to shut myself up for fear of her leaving again.  And I did that ever since.  \n\nHer patience no longer exists and probably fairly so, it’s been years and I should be better.  I want to be better.  This month of the year is always hard with some flash backs to where I was at this moment.  When I get upset nowdays, I get quiet and shut down.  She usually can tell despite my attempts to hide it under jokes and smiles.  She asks what’s wrong but I don’t want to tell her bc she has gotten back to where she gaslights or belittles me again.  And makes me feel stupid for feeling any way, or being upset over something she says.  The big one I keep getting is “I’m allowed to tell you my opinions” which I agree but there’s a way to and not to do that out of respect for my feelings I guess?  \n\nI have realized maybe a year or so ago that I wish I hadn’t stayed with her.  I’d be better alone than dealing with all the crap I am now.  I was a better dad when she wasn’t around, focusing more on fun stuff for them. I find myself stalking the other guy and all our old friends who I no longer see or talk to bc I don’t want any ties to him so he can’t find anything about us or me.  \n\nShe asked me to look something up on her phone the other day on instagram on her best friends page.  I typed the first letter of her friends name, and that’s the same letter his name starts with and he was the second result.  I googled and it said Instagram recommends people you’ve recently associated or searched up.  So that to me tells me one, he’s not blocked anymore and that’s was a big part of it for me.  She denies that, it’s fine I know better than to be gas lit again.  5 times, has taught me better than that.  \n\nI’m so ready to go… I don’t know what to do or think or say… \n\nI truly don’t know what to do.

From the beginning, he told me he lived in another country and that the distance was the only obstacle between us. We talked constantly about closing that gap, about future plans, about being together. He said he was literally counting the days to see me, that I was very important in his life, that he wanted to make me happy, that without me he would struggle in this world. I believed every word.\n\nBut now I’ve found out that everything was a lie. He has been married since 2017. And on top of that, he actually lives in my country since 2022 (which is also the year we met), not abroad like he made me believe. All this time, he pretended to be flying over to see me, when in reality he was just taking a bus from another city nearby. He built this whole story about “long distance” when in fact he was living a double life a few hours away.\n\nI admired him. I saw him as the man of my life, someone strong, successful, someone I could rely on. I loved him with everything I had. And he made me believe he wanted the same - that he wanted a future with me. He would say we were a couple, that I was his “ride or die,” that he couldn’t imagine life without me.\n\nAnd now… I feel like my entire relationship was nothing but a cruel lie. The “distance” he made such a big deal about was fake. The future we planned was fake. The love he promised feels fake.\n\nI’ve already told his wife the truth. She said she had no idea and is disgusted. After I confronted him, all he said to me was: “I’m sorry. I didn’t have a plan. I am a piece of shit. I’m assuming you are going to ruin my life now like I ruined yours.” Later, after his wife already knew, he sent another message: “I’m sorry. You didn’t deserve what I did to you. I have no explanation or justification.”\n\nI’m broken. I don’t even know who I was in this relationship. Was I just a distraction? A fantasy? Did he ever really love me, or was it all manipulation?",

      "selftext": "So i'm sure most of the advice is going to be to just leave and walk away from this marriage ... but I guess i'm here seeking advice anyway. \n\nMy husband is currently in another state. He's a wildland firefighter. A little over a month ago I found out that he had been cheating on me for several months and had a entire relationship behind my back, where he had lied to her saying that he and I were separated. I chose to forgive him and be willing to work on fixing our marriage following those events. This is not the first time that you had cheated. Early on in our relationship, I caught him talking to past girlfriends and sending explicit photos and videos of himself to them. Also something that I had forgave him for. \n\nFollowing his most recent affair, I made very clear that I would like to have each other's location to help give myself some reassurance that he is where he says he is and is doing what he says he's doing. Along with many other things that I would like to work on in our relationship, but those details are less important right now \n\n\nNow to today's problem.\n\nOn three separate nights since my husband has been at this fire, he tells me he's going to bed at a fairly early time (between 8 and 9 p) but then his location shows him leaving base camp. The first time it happened.I did not say anything, but took screenshots of his location and all of his location data with timestamps of when he left base camp and that he was at this address overnight. \n\nThen, a few nights later, the second event happened. This time I noticed that he had left base. This time it was not a residential neighborhood, but still at a house where his location had last showed before he turn it off or turned off his phone. I tried calling him multiple times at night with no answer. Stayed up way later than I should have watching his location to see if it changed. I did however wake up early, early enough to see that he was still at the address. I then watched on the map as he traveled back to base camp.  I then proceeded to call about 20 times and still no answer. He finally called back and claimed that they left to go take care of a lightning strike, potentially a fire. I also brought up the first incident, and he claimed, 'oh I was at base that night.The entire time. I'm not sure why my location wasn't showing me at base. I haven't left to go anywhere, not even to the store' . Maybe i just didn't want to fight but i didnt dispute it. I then calm down a little but still had a feeling something wasnt right about any of this. Red flags were going off, they worked all day before, supposedly got up in the middle of the night to go sit all night long on shift, and then the next morning get no rest and go back to work? Not likely...I also scoured the internet, looking for lightning strike reports in that area and there were absolutely none anywhere, reported that night. I didn't bring the issue back up to him but I knew something wasn't adding up. \n\n\nAnd now tonight is the third time hes pulled the same im going to bed early shit and then leaves base. His location showed about 1 block away from where he was on the first time this happened. But also his location is now turned off, and his phone is still on. And this got me absolutely pissed. I feel like im losing my mind so I sent him screenshot of his location history and screenshot of the map showing him not being where he claims he was. I also tried calling multiple times but no response, he hasn't opened the text messages either. \n\n\nI feel disgusting not being able to trust the man I married to be faithful even when he's away for work. I've already felt so disrespected by his past and fidelity. And now i'm feeling like it's still continuing. I'm scared that he's just lying to me and manipulating me. \nAt first I thought it was just my insecurities and overthinking getting to me, i'm getting the best of me. But now it's happened multiple times and his stories just aren't adding up with what the facts are showing me. \n\nOn top of all of this, we're about to be moving into a new apartment together (we already live together) While he's been gone I have been packing our entire house by myself. I was in a car accident last month, that has limited my ability to do my job as a caregiver so ive not been working much, just for my clients that needed minimum physical assistance. Im still dping all the things i can with my pain from my accident to get everything ready to be moved. Im also doing my best to take care of court filings for my husband whos trying to get custody of son. I put off going back to college this term because of all of this even though it makes it almost impossible for me to meet my credit requirements to apply for a RN program next year. And I'm dealing with the stress of some abnormal ultrasounds and reproductive health concerns alone. So needless to say im already stressed.   \n\n\nTL;DR: Husband has a history of cheating (sexting exes + a recent full-blown affair I forgave). He’s currently out of state on a fire assignment. Three different nights he told me he was going to bed early, but his location showed him leaving base camp and staying at houses, then turning his phone/location off. His excuses don’t add up with the facts. I feel like I’m being lied to and manipulated, but I don’t know if I’m overreacting or if this is proof he’s cheating \n\n\n** new info since I posted on relationships advice**\nI added a ton of girls he has as friends on Facebook and found out hes been messing a girl for a week or so on Snapchat (an app he made me delete over a year ago because he said it was for children and cheating). So im further confirming that hes definitely cheating even if its not physically cheating (at least with this new girl) \n\n\nIs he capable of being loyal after this if I try to fix it... or am I delusional for even thinking that.",

So that’s everyone from drunken mistakes, revenge, young and dumb, unhappy relationships, the last thing before they realized it was over etc. \n\nThat leaves 10% being habitual cheaters. 5% had affairs. 5% cheated on multiple occasions, but no affairs. \n\nSo no. Cheating doesn’t happen to everyone and you can absolutely find a person that will stay loyal. Makes me feel a little bit more optimistic.",

      "selftext": "Hello. I am a 23M who has been with my partner 22NB (they/them please) for 7 1/2 years. We went to high school and college together. We moved in together in fall 2023. If it were a thing in my state, I think we'd be common law by now (though we've also been saying for years that marriage was in our cards after we both graduate college). \n\nI learned in January that they had sex with one of their friends from soccer. They came to me with this information, but it was about 4 months after the fact. I'm honestly still to this day reeling at this reality. At the time, I was going into my hardest college semester yet and I've had a lot going on mentally/personally as well, so while I have done some minor things such as reading on this community, I haven't really brought myself to take next steps. \n\nOne aspect of their cheating was that they had both been drinking at the time. I certainly get in my head about my partner going to the bar weekly without me (I'm often doing other things on bar night), but I also don't think it's fair to ask them not to go.\n\nSince D-Day, my partner has gone on estrogen and their sex drive has gone to almost zero (I think we've had sex once in the past 6 months, which is about the same timeline for their hormones). While this isn't something they can control, it hasn't helped my self-esteem. \n\nSomething I struggle with is that our relationship means everything to me, and I couldn't imagine doing anything so selfish so as to jeopardize it. It feels to me like they thought getting their rocks off that one night was more important than the years we had spent together. It also feels like they can *say* some things and that they love me, but I still feel unloved and unsupported. \n\nI really wanna work through this, but I also don't want to be the only one bearing the burden of THEIR mistake. I feel like I live through the betrayal every day, meanwhile they just treat everything as it used to be. I've suggested couple's therapy and they're on board, but of course it's my job to research a therapist and get us an appointment booked. \n\nI know I'm asking y'all while we're in a case of survivorship bias, but can reconciliation really be successful? Will I ever feel like they love me to the degree I thought they did prior to their infidelity? Maybe I'm keeping myself here because of the sunken cost, hell I can't imagine myself moving out and probably having to depend on my parents again (while I have a job substitute teaching, I'm still putting myself through school and in the meantime I'm pretty financially dependant on my partner and their mom).\n\nI know if it were a friend or one of my sisters asking whether to stay with a wayward partner, I'd be telling them to run for the hills. Am I naïve in thinking my relationship can be fixed?",

Why? I seriously cannot say in my right mind.  \n\nCurrent situation: we are in the process of divorce.  It’s very clean and amicable (he actually suggested it after becoming jealous of a coworker I’m friendly with - definitely NOT doing anything) and now that we’re in the final couple months of waiting for the divorce to be final he has pulled a 180.  Acting like he’s world’s greatest husband and wanting to be intimate (I don’t allow it) but I can’t understand this man.  He wants out for 20 years until I actually agree to a divorce! I’ve lost a lot of weight, have a revenge body lol, and am thriving in many areas.  Can it really be physical and he’s holding on bc I look better than ever? \n\nI’m sooooo over his shit.  Tired of the manipulation and lies, but he is charming as hell.  His superpower I guess.  All my friends and family say he’s a creep and not sure why I allow him to get away with shitty behavior, but for some insane reason I do!! I don’t in any other area of my life, so I’m  lost. I am in therapy, so that’s good, but can anyone give me advice on how to deal with this fucker? I have to live with him for 4 more months until our lease is up or I’d leave now.  ",

After a lot of one-to- one talks and individual self care and counselling, we've just had a weekend away together and things have never been better. Won't work for everyone but we had a deep talk about future goals and aspirations, but also about sex. It's felt like a fresh start. Lots of conversations about why and what I need, and if what we want is compatible. It's been so hard going through the infidelity and other shit but for us, and for me, at the end of the day while infidelity is awful and hurtful and disrespectful, it's not the end of the world. But things that helped: he admitted it before I confronted him; he has entered counselling; he's not once said anything was my fault or indicated that it is.  He's in all ways the perfect husband (does all cooking  and laundry and gardening,  half the cleaning, and parenting is very evenly shared, should me every chance he gets), and we're focusing on the good while working through the bad. Nobody is perfect. And I am in no way saying this applies to physical affairs, which i could never imagine forgiving, but to those dealing with virtual infidelity, its awful, it's horrendous, but maybe there's hope?",

About three weeks after our break up, she did the worst possible thing she could've done. She made out with one of my co workers who I had also considered a friend for the better part of 12 years. I blame my coworker more than I blame her, he initiated it and she was at a point of weakness. I'm not making excuses for her at all. It's a betrayal of trust, theres a lot of things that this effected.\n\n Not only is this person a coworker he is basically a family member of my SO's. Not blood, but he is apart of her family and her family is pissed. They won't even talk to him, and they're very pissed at her. I don't know how to move forward in all of this. I don't know whether to try and fix this relationship and try to forgive or kick her out of my life completely. It's been two weeks since I've known now. I feel like a relationship should not be this complicated. This girl is honestly one of the nicest people I've ever met. I thought she may very well be the \"one\". Mind you my coworker is damn near TWENTY YEARS OLDER THAN HER. its all so messed up. She's only 22. He's 40. \n\n I don't know how to get over any of this and I keep trying to rationalize everything. I'm hurt and I keep thinking that maybe it's time to move on. I feel disrespected. I warned her about this guy many times and we even had fights over it because they had flirted with each other before at parties and to everyone else it was seen as \"normal\". He has known her a lot longer than me, that was what they were use to. Of course I knew it was messed up from the jump and had called her out and tried and tried to make her see reason. Trust me theres more to it on my side, but regardless on my end I truly feel like all of this would've happened anyway. At least that's what my gut tells me. How do I process any of this? I'm so lost, confused, hurt, etc. I don't want to lose this person, but I know I need to respect myself. I don't know what to do. ",

      "selftext": "So my (M24) girlfriend (F23) of seven years cheated on me with a colleague she met on a work trip.\n\nPlease note I am not a very good storyteller or a native English speaker, so sorry if this isn’t a very pleasant reading experience.\n\nTo start, I noticed she had become more distant over the past few months: unhappy at home, not responding to my proposals to go out and do something, less affectionate at home, and so on.\n\nShe left for a work trip for one and a half weeks and hardly made any effort to keep in touch with me. When she got home, she started acting suspiciously with her phone: turning it away when I walked by, taking it to her bedroom when she went to sleep, which she never did before. She told me she’d made some friends with colleagues on the trip and felt awkward with me reading her messages because she had to act social using emojis and slang. I started to get fed up with her behavior, so I asked if she still loved me and if she wanted to continue the relationship. She responded with “I don’t know,” which should have been an obvious sign in hindsight. She later said she wanted to think about it for a bit. A few days later she said she wanted to stay together. At the same time, she kept complaining about my behavior and claimed that everything wrong with her behavior was my fault. I accepted my own mistakes and had been trying to improve myself for some time; she said she noticed that.\n\nA week later we were supposed to leave for our planned holiday. The day before departure she told me she was still having doubts but wanted to continue with the trip and see how it went. I agreed,  stupid as I was. During the trip I noticed she received WhatsApp messages with no name showing, which looked strange. I respected her right to privacy and did not look into it, intending to trust her. The second time it happened she was swimming in the sea and I clicked the notification. I felt something was off. I found out she had locked the chat, requiring a code or fingerprint to unlock it. I waved to her to come and asked about it. She said I was overreacting and that there was nothing wrong. Feeling I was getting angry and needing to step out for a bit, I went back to the hotel. After collecting my thoughts, I texted her to come over to discuss it. She came in and I asked her to take a seat. I then asked if she thought her reaction outside was normal. She said no. I asked why she had locked the chat; she said it was with her male colleagues because I disapproved of male friends. I never really commented on that. I was glad she was finally trying to make friends because she had been antisocial for as long as I’d known her. I demanded to see the chat; she panicked a bit and refused, asking why. I reminded her I would always show my chats if she asked. She started talking about how uncomfortable she felt about me reading her being social with her friends, which I felt was nonsense. I felt I was getting nowhere, so I dropped it for the moment. I told her I trusted her and we continued with our day.\n\nAfter we went to sleep I woke in the middle of the night and grabbed her phone. I went to the bathroom and locked the door. There, I added my fingerprint to her phone using her regular passcode. With it I opened the locked chat and found it. She knocked on the bathroom door, having woken up, and asked if everything was alright. I said yes.\n\nWhen I opened the chat I read for a bit. Then I opened the gallery and saw she had sent him nudes and bikini pictures, the same ones she had sent me. It made me feel sick and angry. I opened the door, showed her the gallery, and called her a slur. Before I knew it I slapped her across the cheek. I am not proud of it, and I still feel sick about it. I never imagined I would be capable of hitting a woman. It happened so quickly I don’t even remember it except for the sound. I did apologize to her a lot afterwards. I can assure you I believe nothing excuses a man slapping a woman. Nothing anybody can say to me will make me feel worse about what I did than I already do.\n\nFor the next few days she kept saying her behavior was my fault. She told me she had not slept with her colleague at that point and had not intended to. I wanted to know what her intentions were, but she said she didn’t know, just that it felt “exciting.”\n\nShe asked what I wanted to do. I told her I did not know if I could forgive her, but I would like to try. I felt I owed her that after seven years at least. I told her there would be conditions if we continued: break it off with the colleague, block him, and get a new job somewhere else.\n\nShe said she would do that if we continued our relationship. Later she said she was not sure she could break a good friendship with him. I do not believe a woman can be friends with a man she sends nudes to, but that might be my issue. She said she wanted to think about it; I personally started to emotionally detach from her at that point.\n\nOn the last day of our holiday we had booked a hotel room near the airport because we had an early flight. I told her I would like to try to have at least one good day before going home. We went out to dinner and she could barely eat; she could hardly have any conversation with me. I decided that when we got back to the hotel I would formally end the relationship, since she was too cowardly to do so.\n\nWe flew home the next day; I’d booked a seat separated from her to give myself space. When we arrived home she wanted to talk more. She told me she wanted to try a break, or a “breakup slowly” (whatever that is supposed to mean,  I have no idea). During this break she said she would not cut off her colleague. That would basically mean she would use me as a backup in case her attempt with him failed, and at the same time we would not work to improve our relationship. I told her that, and she said she wanted to sleep on it and discuss it the next day. I agreed. Feeling something was off, I checked her Google search history through her login on our shared laptop. She had been looking at hotels near our house. I woke her up and asked about it. I asked her if she could admit she intended to physically cheat on me. After a few times of saying no, she admitted it. I asked what she would do in my position and she said she would break up. I told her there was nothing else to discuss about restarting our relationship.\n\nTwo days later she decided to sleep with her colleague in a hotel. A week later she did it again, proving to me she had not cared about our relationship for some time. In the meantime we have been living together while I look for another place to stay. She is very rude, refuses to acknowledge anything she did wrong, and keeps complaining to me. At the same time she does not want to talk and sometimes gets very sad because she feels lonely. I have tried to remain friendly while I still live under the same roof with her. Yesterday I came home late after drinks with friends; she asked how my day was and I said it was good. She was obviously unhappy that I came home late and had a good day. I asked about her day and got “It was fine.” Later she started complaining about a bunch of nonsense; she also said she is unhappy because I still live with her and that she has no place of her own. I told her that was not my fault but her own. She didn’t appreciate this and got angrier. Since then I just wear my headphones and play music if she is around, ignoring her.\n\nFor some reason I feel venting to strangers on the internet is the way to go. No idea what to expect from this.\n\n  \nTLDR: Girlfriend of 7 years cheated on me with a colleague.\n",

We had a really hard year where he was deployed and we fought so much this year. I left to go to my parents and get some therapy to work through this. \n\nThe biggest betrayal for me comes from the lying. I asked if he watched porn when he came back from deployment (he had agreed not to for a while, but I said it was fine within the last year). He always said he didn’t and only looked at my photos. He’s been using Reddit for sexting like 4ish times (that’s what he admitted to) for sexting w people and ofc lied abt that until i found a screenshot of a chat and then he admitted the whole thing. He is 100% focused on reconciliation according to him and is seeking therapy for his lying issues. His dad and brother (according to his mom) have the same issues. He said he sees his parent’s relationship and doesn’t want to be like his dad. I wanna believe him but I feel like he’s saying everything he can to make me feel better about staying. \n\nI think I would feel differently if he had told me on his own. He claims he never felt comfortable having those conversations with me and we were really distant this year. My parents want to move forward with divorce immediately and find a new place to live on my own. I just feel stuck in indecision. \n\nHow did you stop the ongoing loop of indecision? Will it come with time and therapy? Am I trying to force something that clearly isn’t working? Is there any motto that helped you have clarity in situations where you were going back  and forth? ",

He forced himself on her. And it’s been more than a year, and she’s still in trauma because of it. She cries, she can’t really be close to anyone even when she tries to date, and apparently almost everyone in college hates him now.\n\nAnd as if that wasn’t enough, I also heard from a few of my friends that after we broke up, he would hang out with them and get a little touchy even when they said no. He just wouldn’t get the hint. And like… I get that people have urges, but not everyone does that with every woman they meet. Not with female friends. It’s honestly shocking to me because with me, he was the complete opposite. He was so clear about wanting to actually date me before even touching me. He only got intimate after he proposed and made it official.\n\nI just feel sick. It’s like I never really knew who I was with. I used to hate that girl, now I just feel awful for her. And knowing all this now… I’m just relieved I got out when I did.\n\n",

      "selftext": "This is a stupid post but hang in there\n\nI was out with a group of friends tonight and the topic of love came up. Someone ended up asking me if I ever loved anyone and I said “ooooooh let me tell you”. \n\nI essentially told them about my previous partner and what he did. One of my friends chimes in saying she had been cheated on too, her partner cheated on her with her best friend, but it had to happen, because it’s how she ended up meeting the love of her life. Then another friend chimed in saying how his girlfriend of eight years cheated on him. We both spoke about those really niche feelings that popped up “did you take her back?” “It feels like a horrible dream” “at least we don’t have to carry the guilt they do” “it sucks that a part of you still cares while they move on”.\n\nWe all group hugged and he and I just danced the night away after that. Not flirtatiously but not as friends either. Just as two people who understand how it feels to be betrayed, to hurt, to try and move past it. \n\nAnyhow, there’s real camaraderie when you get cheated on. I think we see it here in this community but it carries over to the real world too.\n\nTo whoever is reading this. I wish we could dance together while saying “screw them” and “I’m scared I’ll never love someone like that again” over the music. Life goes on without them, and you gain a perspective from the experience that helps you connect with people. Is it worth it? Who knows. But life keeps moving regardless. Are you going to dance or not?",

He opened up about having a porn addiction that he ‘stopped’ 2 years ago.. he had told me he had one because he was abused in his past relationships sexually and porn was a way for him to get that satisfaction without being abused or made fun of his sexual performance.\n\nHe gave me all his passwords and full access to his phone and i ultimately found him watching tons of half naked girls on Facebook reels.\n\nHe also did this in the beginning of our relationship, watching girls on TikTok and I broke up with him over it but took him back. And yet, he’s been doing it all this time.\n\nI’m heartbroken over the whole situation. We miscarried, got married.. and this is what he does while I’ve spent the last 5 years loving him unconditionally… we’ve only been married 3 months.\n\nI gave him one chance to prove himself. He’s going to therapy, we are going to go to couples therapy, and he keeps swearing he’s going to do everything he can to rebuild what he broke and says he will never hurt me again. He’s cried several times. But I keep reading stories and TikTok’s of people saying they never change, they just get sneakier. I’m having a hard time believing he will change if he’s been doing it for so long and big life events didn’t make him grow up.\n\nI told him it’s like listening to a drug addict say they’ll stop doing drugs.. they can’t just stop. They lie and promise things then go get high.\n\nI told him he had a sliver of a chance and 6 months to prove himself and make a change or I’m leaving for my own sake. He said that losing me really hit him and the thought of destroying his life all for this made him want to stop and change.\n\nI’m trying not to think about it.. the lies, what he did, all of it.. it’s just really difficult. It hangs over my head.\n\nHow do I stop thinking about it? ",

      "selftext": "I (26F) have recently been cheated on by this guy (30M) I was completely in love with. We were together for more than a year, spoke about our future together and marriage etc. He lied to me that he's told his parents about me. It's just been a month and I'm unable to accept that this has happened. He cheated on me with multiple people throughout our relationship and he was also in a LDR with his best friend since 3.5 years. The details of this entire ordeal will feel straight out of a movie. I think at this point I've lost faith in humanity and all sorts of relationships. And don't think I can ever get over this. I'm a very sweet and honest person who never wronged anybody and I cannot believe this has happened to me. More than anything, I trusted him over my gut feelings that I had about multiple things from time to time and blamed it on my trust issues due to previous relationships. In a way, I broke my own trust too. Will I ever get over this? I do not want this to change me as a person, I'm an optimistic and hopeful person. Also, do cheaters feel any shame/remorse? ",

      "selftext": "This is a long story so I apologise in advance. I’ve had suspicions for a while that my partner of 14 years has met someone new. \n\n\nWe used to live together renting a few years ago but both moved in with friends/family to save money to buy a place together which conversations about stoped a long time ago. He’s busy at work and I’m in school and working part time so trying to get together to hang out is difficult every time I ask he’s busy or “too tired”.\n\n\nI’ve been trying in therapy to work on my communication and how to improve the relationship between us.\n\n\nMonths ago my he told me that his sibling was getting married but it was a small ceremony and I wouldn’t be invited because it was just immediate family. Then one day last week he messaged to say that he had a really busy day with lots going on at work so I might not hear from him until the next day. \n\n\nFast forward to the weekend and I’m speaking to one of his family members who asks me if I heard about the wedding. Thinking they just mean that they’re getting married I say yes. This person then starts telling me that it was beautiful and that the venue was great etc. I asked if they had seen my partner there and they said yes, with someone he works with. \n\n\nWhen I confronted him about this he denied that there had been a wedding saying that the family member was old and confused and didn’t even know what they’d had for breakfast. Asking do I really believe what an old person is telling me, do I think he’d lie to me and have a secret relationship. Telling me to call his family members and ask them, because they would tell me that there definitely wasn’t a wedding last week etc. \n\n\nA few days later I visited the family member who told me again what had happened and what they had seen. They definitely weren’t confused and said that after I had initially confronted my partner they had received an angry phone call from him asking why they were telling me things they’d been told to keep quiet.\n\n\nI once again asked my partner what had happened and he still kept saying there wasn’t a wedding, the family member is confused, call my parents etc. I told them I didn’t need to do that because I’d already been told the truth.\nI said if one of their family respected me enough to tell the truth then he should too. \n\n\nHe eventually said that there was a “party” last week not a wedding. That they didn’t tell me because he had only decided last minute to go and they thought I’d be upset about it so didn’t say anything. Then he said that he was there alone and the person they were seen with was another guest he was just chatting to.\n\n\nNow I don’t believe any of this new story to be honest. After all the lies this just seems like a sliver of truth to keep me off his back.\n\n\nHe’s now acting completely normally and was initially making more effort with me than he has in months which died off after a few days, probably because I’m not giving the same energy back. \n\n\nEven if this new story is true I don’t know how I can be in a relationship with someone who lies so easily and makes me doubt myself for even questioning them. \n\n\nIf you read all of that thank you so much I know it’s long and a bit chaotic. Does anyone have any advice or suggestions on what I do moving forward? ",

I already knew he was avoidant,  narc, insecure, porn fried, always the victim, bedroom dead. But I told myself he was a good person deep down. Then I got pregnant. First prenatal check revealed an STD. Turns out he’d been to massage parlors four times, once unprotected—thinking rubbing alcohol made it safe. I had to squeeze the info out of him -one piece of info with each squeeze. He also said when he cheated first in March it was “triggered by our arguments”. Okay. Later I found proof he’d been looking up and texting parlors since the start of our marriage—it wasn’t about fights at all.\n\nI was shattered. I planned an abortion and to leave. I usually cut bad relationships quickly. But I couldn’t bring myself to end the pregnancy, so I gave him one last chance for the baby’s sake after some serious considerations. We tried a month of therapy, talks, compromises. I pushed myself to commit to reconciliation & change—initiating more, softening my tone—things improved until I caught him lying about small things. In the duration of the month he has said insane stuffs like “I’m grateful the baby saved our marriage and renewed it,”  on top of that he continued yelling, defending, trickle truthing, and dodging accountability. I realized nothing would ever change.\n\nSo today I told him: we either open the marriage or divorce. He tried to start another argument and ending up shrugged, “whatever you want.” And for the first time, I felt free. The day started hard but ended up so peaceful and inspiring. I started replying to old DMs and friends—chatting about music, groceries, careers, politics—mundane, peaceful, drama-free conversations, big and small. I hadn’t realized how much I missed that.\n\nI don’t have everything figured out yet, especially with a baby on the way on my financial situation, but for the first time in a long time I feel alive. Like the stars and clouds in the night sky suddenly got colors and scents. There’s so much life outside this infidelity, and my funny little try at reconciling. \n\nI didn’t know making this decision would feel this good until today. I guess what I want to say is when we shrink ourselves to something that no longer fits us, we kill our own spirit. Not talking everyone out of reconciliation, ofc. But life is short, please move forward with whatever makes you feel alive. At least step outside! There’s so much going on\n",

      "selftext": "My wife [30F] and I [31M] have been together for 11 years, married for 6. We met in college and have been through so much together. We supported each other through our careers and even moved to three different countries, so for a long time, we were each other's only support system. Our life was 99% wonderful, full of love and partnership.\n\nA year ago, I discovered something awful. For at least 4 years, she was constantly sexting with other people, mainly with one colleague. She sent them very intimate messages and photos. She even met some of them in person. For my own peace of mind, I convinced myself there was no physical contact, even though I now suspect there was. We had huge fights about it, and she swore it would never happen again. Since we were far from our families, I tried to process it and forgive her.\nTwo weeks ago, I couldn't sleep because of stress from work, and the memories started flooding back. I connected all the dots, and it hit me hard. I was naive and desperate a year ago not to think about it clearly, but cheaters always remain cheaters. \n\nEven after all our arguments, she's still doing it. Our parents are visiting this month, so I don't want to start any serious conversations now, but as soon as they leave, I will tell her how I feel and demand a divorce.\n\nI'm in absolute limbo. At home, I'm a loving and caring husband. But on my way to work, I'm a mess, a sobbing wreck filled with self-pity. My self-esteem has always been a struggle, but this has completely knocked the ground out from under me. I've never felt so empty, pathetic, worthless, lonely, and undeserving of anything good in my life.\nWe were saving for a house and were planning to have kids soon. On one hand, I'm glad we didn't buy a house yet, but I'm devastated that the person who was my whole world turned out to be someone I don't even know. \n\nMy only confidant has been Google's Gemini, because I have no one else. But after a few days of venting, it loses context, and I feel like I've lost a friend. I feel like in today's world, with all the technology and ease of communication, it's impossible to find genuine honesty. I feel so lost. I'm hurting. I feel like I'll be alone forever. I hate people. I hate myself.\n\nI feel so lost and broken. For those who have been through this, how do you find the strength to even get out of bed in the morning? How do you cope with such overwhelming loneliness and pain?",

      "selftext": "So I'll preface by saying....yes, I know it could have been a hell of a lot worse. But I still feel like I've been hit full force by a sledgehammer. \n\nSnooped through my bf of 2 years phone. No irl physical cheating but too many instances of micro-cheating. \n\nI'm embarrassed to say, but he was a cringe reply guy for a popular OF model on IG. We have a very satisfying and active sex life so porn usage never bothered me but paying for it is where I draw the line. I have 3 kids from prev relationships, he has taken them as his own and loves them. We live together and share all our bills so knowing he is as trying to buy porn when that money could have gone to our home or family cuts deep. I just can't get over how many times he replied to her stories saying 'I wish' 'I wish I could' even 'you're a work of art' he's never called me a work of art. \n\nThen I saw messages between a friend of his and him where she apparently was asking if he was cut or uncut, then she sent him a nude unprompted, he replied to something she said saying 'I can't, I'm taken' but replied to the photo saying 'appreciate the photo though😉'. She got upset and unsent her messages and blocked him. From his replies it seemed like she felt bad and didn't want it to happen again. \n\nI saw he video called an old coworker at 8am when he was still drunk from us going out the night before. She didn't answer and he says he doesn't remember why he called her. No previous calls but they would send each other reels a good amount. \n\nI almost got over all of that but then I found worse messages. \n\nRandom times throughout the two years he would message his best friends about other women he knows even some he works with and they are all women he's introduced me to as just friends. But he said things like 'I love my gf but....so and so is hot i fucked up w her' 'so and so said they wanted to fuck me my gf will understand it's for the greater good lol' 'I'd eat so and so's ass oh and what's her face too' and his friends saying like 'I'm going to go see you I'm with ___ I brought them for you' when it was one of these girls he was attracted to. I understand some people joke with besties about hot people, hell I've made jokes like that in the past w other relationships. But he and all his friends have made such strong cases for why he's such a good guy and they were so happy for us to be dating. They were so happy he was happy and a family man now. I had multiple people cry to me about how much they considered him a good guy and how great of a friend he was. I thought I won the lottery. \n\nNow I'm a shell of a person. I mourn who I thought I was dating and I miss my bf from a month ago but more importantly I miss myself. I don't know who I am anymore. Am I buying these clothes or makeup or jewelry bc I like it or bc those girls would wear it? Am I wanting to prioritize self care to heal or bc I want to be hot like those girls. Bc obviously none of them looked or dressed like me at all so now I'm convinced he settled for me and I'm not his type. \n\nHe has apologized profusely, he has cried and sobbed and promised he would never do anything like that again. He went on his own and signed up for therapy bc he says he wants to work through his childhood trauma and learn to be a better man for me and the kids. He has reassured me every time I ask he answers every question I hurl at him he has never gotten frustrated at my screaming at him. He's hitting all the notes of a genuine apologetic betrayer and I do believe he wants to put in the work. But the issue isn't me not believing his future but of how hurt I am by the past. I genuinely don't know if I can get over this. \n\nHave any of y'all healed from betrayal? I haven't eaten a meal in 3 weeks. I feel like I'm going crazy, literally insane. I just want to heal. I know it takes time but it just feels so hopeless right now. ",

Me and him met during the pandemic and were long distance until we got married.\n\nI met him after 1.5 years into the relationship for the first time in real life. Had my first kiss with him during my trip to visit him.\n\nWe used to Skype or zoom every night for 3 and half years. Everything free moment I had i gave to him. I used be so scared that he would leave me and cry alot about it (this is my only serious relationship I have had in my life)\n\nHe used to tell me about women who liked him and I would get so worried. Typing that made me realise how shitting that was of him.\n\nFrom the beginning we talk about marriage and had extensive conversation and debates. Discussing boundaries and deal breakers ect. \nI asked that he propose to me but he never did and that truly still upsets me to this day. \n\nAnyways we get married and all is good. I settle in great. Have a good relationship with his family. I got a job at company A and started working. 3 months and 1 day into our marriage I find out he has been sexting with 100s men and women throughout our whole relationship and having sensual massages.. I dont have a problem with my husband being attracted to men, but he lied. I asked him several times how he feels sexually and opened up about myself. \n\nI found this out 10 mins before a job interview, using his computer and I dont know how I held it together (I got the job at company b) I felt like a zombie, the more I looked the more I found. \n\nI was absolutely heartbroken, i have had a pretty traumatised life but this was byfar the worst. \nI confronted him after I finished the job interview and he broke down. Telling me he was sorry. It was because of his tramua and he manipulatied me into staying as he threatened his life. So I stayed, do I regret it? sometimes yes. \n\nI said I would stay if he attended therapy which he has done and is still doing. He promised he would work on himself and be better. Also during the conversations i found on his computer I found out  he was recording and storing my erotic calls and photos to him which i never consented too. I feel like everything was brushed under the carpet when he threatened his life and i had to forgive him there and then. \n\nDo I love this man? Yes \nCan I look at him the same? No \n\nI am really struggling with my relationship with him. I feel so angry and heartbroken but have to pretend I'm ok. Everytime i have wanted to have a conversation about this situation he starts spiralling into darkness and I have to be the bigger person and comfort him and pull him out of his depression.\n\nI have never did anything like this to him\n\nOur s*x life has taken a massive hit. I want to but he doesn't. Never in the mood or not feeling well.\nGives me whiplash \n\nIts been over a 1 year since the situation but I just can't get over it. \nSometimes I want to walk away and never return. Other times he is the best thing in my life.\n\nMy question is to you: how can I manage this better?\n\nPs please be kind \nFirst time posting on reddit",

Didn't find out why until father's day when I looked at her phone and confronted her. Got pregnant and had a miscarriage while we were \"on a break\" to that guy due to the stress of the whole situation and swore she cut things off because he apologized after being such a horrible person to her. \n\nIn between this she tried to sell our engagement ring which nobody would take and has been off and on her anti depressants which has made life very difficult because it's like walking on egg shells. Mention one thing and it evolved into a big argument. \n\nRoll around another month and she's pregnant again. Says she hates herself for putting us in this situation as she should have learned her lesson. Tells me if it's mine doesn't mean we'll be in a relationship but fully expects my support. It's week 8 now and she claims it's my baby but there's a slight chance it's not because she \"bumped\" into that guy again during a night out with her friends (told me she blocked him) over a month ago and didn't come home until 9 in the morning but swore he didn't finish in her. Only reason I've stuck around so long is because our 2 kids are suffering because she can't cope with them alone and I've been thinking we'd get through this and be a family again but something tells me she just doesn't want to be alone. \n\nYesterday I made the mistake of talking to a neighbour about our issues including how she joked about how life would be easier being swingers because of that Mormon show on Disney, tried to sell our engagement ring, cheated on me and is pregnant again but the baby might not be mine because we're getting a paternity test soon. The neighbour obviously asked her about this and she was naturally very angry and furious with me for being honest with someone when she wanted everything to be dealt with in private and doesn't want to be the talk of the street which I understand and is my fault entirely. \n\nWhich left me kicked out of the house and moving back into my brother's because she doesn't trust me anymore and have publicly embarrassed her. From then she's demanded we get the paternity test ASAP so she can make a decision to keep it if it's mine or get rid of it if isn't. Literally don't know where to go from here. ",

      "selftext": "I’ve posted here a lot so many of you probably already know what went down - and I thank all of you immensely for your support and counsel during a very, very dark period in my life. \n\nFor those that don’t know, here’s the backstory. I’ll “UPDATE” below so those who are familiar with my situation can skip down there 👇🏼 : In May, after we’d been struggling for some time, I got my wife of 9 years to agree to attend CT. \n\nShe went to an epic 3 hour session and then, the next night, a joint session with me. Prior to that, I’d caught her in a white lie after she’d gone out clubbing with friends who left early and I found out she stayed on her own. I said to her in that session (this is in May), “don’t ever lie to me again.” She looked me in the eyes and said, “I won’t.”\n\nIn June, I discovered she had met with her ex. They met in a public place and she took my son so I know nothing happened, but I nearly ended it then as she had been planning it for a week in secret and hiding it from me. I told her to cease contact and block him. She refused. Then gaslit me. Told me I was being crazy and that they were “just friends.” She said he was married and didn’t want her in any way. A week later I caught them sexting. Very specific sexting about him wanting to fuck her. She responded and pushed it further. And she was doing it while sitting not a foot away from me. I call that DDay One. \n\nAgain, I was going to end it. But she finally said she would go block him an go to CT again and so we did. In therapy it came out that she knew he was now divorced, that he started sexting and that she “liked it.”\n\nI was in massive amounts of pain and couldn’t stop trying to understand it - which, of course, you can’t. I was in a full-on spiral and it was bad. But the worst was yet to come. In the meantime, she told me I needed to “stop taking about it” or I would “destroy what’s left of us.” That was more gaslighting. I later discovered 145 selfies she took to send him some selects and also screen grabs of bus and train schedules to get him from where he was staying to where she was staying on a work trip. \n\nWhy? Because I discovered in August that she’d been having EA that then turned into a PA for 6 months!! DDay Two. They deny having slept together but… nothing she says is truthful so… I doubt it. \n\nUPDATE\n\nCut to today. I talked to lawyers and moved out three weeks ago. She and I now share 50/50 custody of our son.  And  in regard to our child, so far, she has been fairly agreeable. \n\nBUT… in regard to me, she has been awful. Just mean and cold. She has said things like, “I’m sorry I hurt you, but I don’t regret the affair. It made me feel good .”\n\nMy last discovery was both better and worse:\n\nI found out, thanks to my little boy, that she’d been sexting a coworker in private chats for our entire 9 years. DDay Three. \n\nThen last night she tried to tell me that old classic: “I didn’t plan it, it just happened.” \n\nUh, yeah, no it didn’t. You took his number. You pursued him. You set up the dates. You traveled to see him. Multiple times. You met him just 10 minutes away from where I was working and kissed him multiple times on the street, then picked our kid up from school, waited for me to get home and then kissed me. \n\nNext she said that she thinks this is just who she is - but that she doesn’t consider herself a cheater on the level of her boyfriend from her last longest relationship (7 years) who had cheated on her as if he were getting paid for it. \n\nI admitted there are levels to infidelity. But nonetheless the pain is overwhelming regardless of how long it went on or what happened. The simple truth is that it makes one question everything. It taints everything that happened over that period. And it’s fucking horrible. \n\nShe told me that this is actually who she is. She said she has “a big ego” and needs the gratification that comes with the attention of other men. She admitted to being a narcissist and chasing it. \n\nOddly, when I asked her what she’d think if I came to her and told her I’d been sexting other women for 9 years behind her back, she said she wouldn’t like it. \n\nWhat this ultimately means is that I made the right decision to bail on R and begin to just focus on my son and I. She is sick. A serial cheater and admitted narcissist. If I hadn’t caught her, the sexting would continue. She’d likely have met with and fucked her ex and she was (again, admittedly) probably only 2-3 dates away from sleeping with her PA partner. \n\nShe feels no regret. Shows no remorse. And when confronted with what she caused, she seems to shrug it off. Or get defensive and angry. She doesn’t want to be the bad guy. Even though she is. \n\nSo that’s it. My entire relationship was a lie. She pretended to be something else. SomeONE else. And eventually she reverted back to her old ways. \n\nI fucked up a lot in the aftermath. I tried to explain why I was so hurt. I begged for answers. I danced the “pick me” dance. And then I started reading Leave A Cheater, Gain A Life as SO many of you recommended and it was eye-opening. I wish I’d had it on DDay One. \n\nSo that’s it. 9 years over. Making a new start with my boy. It’s been a brutal few months now. I’m still not out of the darkness but I feel like I’m getting there. \n\nThe things she said to me last night showed me there is NO FUCKING WAY I could ever - EVER - reconcile with her. No way to trust her. She is lost. And she is a TERRIBLE FUCKING PERSON. She just hid it well. \n\n",

      "selftext": "There were some mini updates in the last post. Mainly answering common questions so here's the link to the last post. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/survivinginfidelity/s/s2y2SRfBnp\n\nI checked her phone for one last time and learned that she has apparently ended the affair. This appears based on dates to havehad happened just two days after my last peek at her phone.  Obviously I can only go by what I see so I'll accept that she did end it. The real evidence came in her BFF messages. \n\nShe confirmed with her BFF and stated that she had been trying to end it since the incident in the bar.  That she claims snapped her back to reality. Still took her almost five months so go figure. She even addressed the smiley face reply by saying she was too scared to say anything against him because it looked like everything was blowing up and she didn't know what he was capable of doing. Again, took five months to end it. \n\nHer BFF stayed true to her shitty character. My wife almost confessed twice in the past month but BFF talked her out of it. One of these I actually rember based on what she told her friend. She had come home for lunch a week ago this past Monday. Not unheard if but rare and had not happened in the last year. Her eyes appeared swollen like she had been crying. She was going to tell me that day but chickened out. \n\nOh and the BFF gave me enough clues to figure out her AP. While trying to talk my wife out of telling me she said, \"(BFFs husband) would have kicked me out and left me broke two years ago if he knew I fucked our neighbor. Not to mention how upset (BFFs daughter) Would have been.\" \n\nBFFs daughter was a senior in high school two years ago. Their neighbor across the street was and is a math teacher at her high school. He and his wife are known to us obviously as he has been a teacher for over ten years at the same school. Sooooo... Yeah. Another family blown up by infidelity. \n\nNothing has changed. I have decided ghosting is probably the best route. I have my plan ready but I'll save that. I think I need to keep these as actual updates and not talk about future plans or ideas. \n\nI don't know when I'll update because the plan I have will be a kind of one two punch and I expect a lot to happen quickly and then things settle down. Then I have a third punch so to speak.\n\nAnd again,  I'm getting a lot of legal advice. I appreciate your concern but I have a lawyer that I am happy with and has given me plenty of legal advice. No offense but since I'm paying her for legal advice it's her legal advice I'll follow.  Divorce in my state is pretty straightforward and not very hard. Very short waiting period if uncontested. I'm aware of the ramifications of what I'm planning. \n\nThanks everyone for your support and advice. Those that have reached out in private thank you. Some I have had discussions with other I have not. Please don't take offense just too many to engage with. \n\nAgain thank you. \n",

      "selftext": "My girlfriend of 3.5 years finally admitted last night that she cheated on me. We've been talking about breaking up for the past month or so just because our futures looked very different, which was very sad but in my eyes, a mature and civilized breakup.\n\nShe is moving out this weekend and earlier this week I read her diary and found out about 'another guy'. I immediately rang her and we met up to discuss the situation. Three days of me constantly asking her and her promising me and swearing on her mother's life that she didn't cheat... Last night the truth came out in a conversation, I didn't have the energy to cry or be angry, I haven't eaten in 3 days.\n\nShe made me feel like the bad guy for reading her diary, I'm not exactly the good guy but I'm not the one who cheated. The thing I hate the most is that she gets what she wants, a breakup and to continue on with someone else.\n\nShe was scared to admit it in the first place because of the consequences. We moved to a new country last year and so I have the ability to tell all her friends out here what she did, but I don't think I will. Our mutual friends will likely find out eventually because I don't want her to be around me anymore.\n\nI feel like I should tell her mother, as a way of revenge but also so someone can look out for her, the only way this gets worse is if something happens to her. Do I give my ex an ultimatum and tell her to tell her mum or else I will? Or do I get the satisfaction of telling her myself?\n\nTL;DR - Gf cheated on me, should I tell her mother?",

      "selftext": "https://www.reddit.com/r/survivinginfidelity/s/clmHoIVBef\n\nOn the night of the breakup she sent me a short apology that barely touched the issue. She doubled down that he was a friend and that the situation only looked bad. I just ignored it, my only communication with her is to get my things back. Her best friend reacted to the message I sent her that I found out about the other guy with a 👍. She removed the 👍 a day later. This is her best friend that told her I’m not treating her well and introduced her to the other guy. This was shortly after a major surgery that left me bedridden for a few months. (I am still in recovery) \n\nI haven’t looked back since kicking her out. I gave her an hour to pack my things at her place since it isn’t a lot. She wouldn’t let me go to her on the day of the break up since she was away and then she kept postponing whatever times we agreed on. 3 days after the breakup she finally agreed a time to let me come get my things. She tried to postpone again but I just went at the previously agreed upon time. I told her I was there and waited. She arrived at her apartment with the other guy. She had him park far and walked the distance so it was difficult to see him properly. I was fuming inside but didn’t do or say anything. She said she’ll give my things to her roommate to give to me and i just nodded. Took her 20 minutes to pack it up and give but when I checked I realised not all my things were given back. I tried to phone them but they wouldn’t pick up. I told her I’ll come later for the rest of my things but she’s back to making excuses again. Dragging a 5 minute process out.\n\nI know I made the right call and I’m sticking with it but it hurts seeing her be so smug about the situation. She’s only blocked me on her main IG not long after the breakup. Hasn’t blocked me on anything else. My friends can see her IG and she’s posting her and her best friend in her apartment while she’s still wearing my clothes. She looked completely unphased getting out of his car and showing him to me basically admitting to me that I was right. She is showing negative remorse. Like she wants me to hate her even more and it’s working. I considered blocking her myself but I don’t want to give them any more energy. I’ve decided to just forget about the clothes she still has because she’s getting off on the frustration she’s causing. \n\nMy friends say she’s trying to get a reaction out of me. I’m not reacting badly I don’t think. Today I go NC",

He swore he never watched porn and apparently was watching like every other week (I was fine with porn so this confused me). I want to believe his every word and I am pregnant. I want the family. But at the end of the day I can't seem to get past him lying for so long. Even if it wasn't a physical relationship or the same girl 2x, it was all lust and what if he continues to have the same desires. \n\nI am in therapy, but I feel crazy for even considering working this out because, although he offered to give me full access to everything, I've always had his passwords and access to his phone.

      "selftext": "Hey, I’d like to share my break up story:\n\nMe and my ex broke up about 42 days ago. He said he was tired of the relationship because of my emotional dysregulation (from childhood).\n\nHe saw me as a friend at the end. He told me he was anxious around me because I often would get irritated easily or isolate myself. He wanted to break up long time ago during the 3 years (where we dated over 2 years) but I always begged for another chance and that I will get help, but I never did cause i didn’t know where it came from until now. \n\nSo he cheated on me with his ex situationship and broke up with me. After break up they have  been seeing each other a lot and talk a lot when they can. They share acoa trauma (adult children of an alcoholic) which makes them understand each other. They try if they ever have anything. During our relationship he told me removed ex and situationships from social medias, but he never told me he kept this woman on snapchat. I didn’t think it was a big deal if he kept all of them, but this just feels weird.\n\nAfter break up ex compared me and her. He said that she can talk about things and doesn’t yell or get mad easily. But he did say we had good times and there was a lot of good in me. \n\nHe was also pretty cold towards me after break up and blamed it on me. He cheated on his first partner and his partner cheated back. They stayed together until she got caught seeing other man. Then she broke up with him even when he didn’t want to. After that he slept around a lot. Then he met his ex situationship and they tried about 6 months but he cut it off because he didn’t know what he wants and wasn’t over his ex. Now is basically the same, but he claims he wanted to break up a long time ago, but then again he said 2 weeks after break up that he’s not over it. Idk if its still true. \n\nHe still follows me on social media and keeps streak on snap. We haven’t talked now in 2 weeks.\n\nOh, and forgot to mention that he’s ADHD ja Highly Sensitive Person.\n\nAm I bad a person because I didn’t get help on time to save this relationship? Or do you think there was something else going on than only my problems?\n\nDo you think he will regret this later? I still miss him even after everything that happened.\nDo you guys think he will come back? Or that will their situationship turn into relationship? ",

Breaking it requires both signatures and she refuses to agree since she has no job and nowhere else to go. So I am trapped here.\n\nLast night she actually told me she wanted to bring someone over and asked if I could just stay in my room. Absolutely not. I do not care that she pays half the rent. That is a level of disrespect that will not be tolerated.\n\nI told her no and explained that I do not want strangers in this apartment sitting on our furniture around our cat invading my space. She backtracked and said they would just go out instead but after everything the cheating the lying the complete disregard I cannot take her word for anything.\n\nTo make matters worse we live in a college town and end up at the same bars. I often see her hanging all over questionable men and it is just a shame to witness.\n\nI am disgusted and stuck.\n\nHow do you enforce boundaries when you are living with your ex and have no way out? \n",

      "selftext": "For context, my ex lied about S.A. and pretended to be dealing with trauma, severe depression, self-harm, and suicidal thoughts. She used all of that just to give me the bare minimum of affection and time together. I was sick with worry for her safety, but it turns out it was all a lie—she was dating me and another guy at the same time.\n\nI spent 6 months in this routine because she pretended so well to be depressed. I also gave her many chances for us to break up, but she acted like she was interested in me and said the problem was only her mental state. I endured because I loved her and didn’t want to leave my partner if she was really struggling with a difficult mental disorder. I actually thought about breaking up every time she mistreated me, but then I told myself: “If it’s hard for me, imagine how hard it must be for her.”\n\nEventually, we broke up. Five months later, when I was starting to move on, she came back saying she thought about me every day, missed me, and was afraid I had moved on, hated her, or even left the country or state. But when given the opportunity, she didn’t want to get back together. I thought that was strange and contacted one of her work friends—and to my surprise, I discovered she had been cheating with a coworker the whole time (I found out on my birthday). I also learned that she told people I was “dangerous” and spread many other lies. Her own friends had already cut contact with her months earlier because they realized she was a compulsive liar.\n\nNow it’s been another 5 months, and I’m still as messed up as the day I discovered everything. The fact that she chose someone else, but also thought it was better to lie about depression and S.A. just to keep me around with the bare minimum, and then spread lies about me before running away—without giving me closure or even saying sorry—still haunts me. She just manipulated me and blocked me on everything.\n\nI know she doesn’t care if I suffered or what I felt, and she probably doesn’t even remember me. But I’m still haunted by everything, and I feel broken.\n\nWill this pass? Will I eventually get better? Because it doesn’t seem like it—and 5 months feels like a long time. Shouldn’t I be better by now?\n\nAlso, this is the short version. The full story is even worse.\n\nP.S.: English is my second language, so I used GPT to fix the grammar",

      "selftext": "Long story short, my husband of 20 years had mutliple affairs, 2 sexual, several other attempts. I stayed. He did the work. Took 100% accountability, never once blamed me. He did individual therapy. He is a former cop who has a LOT of trauma from what he's seen and basically he was trying to drown that out with the excitement of infidelity. We have 4 kids that were in elementary at the time. I decided to stay. To try, even though he didn't deserve it. Of course I had/have the triggers, the paranoia, constant questioning etc. He was always good about that. But I felt stuck. I felt like everything went back to the way it was with the exception of adding life 360 and him telling me everywhere he would be. Fast forward 6 years, i feel a lot of resentment towards him. I feel like I am back to helping him with his anxiety/depression and making sure his \"needs\" are met in every way (emotionally and physically). While mine are just not important. We have tried talking about it but we always end up arguing and he just blames me for the arguments. I feel like I can't have an opinion about anything that differs from him. He doesn't see what he is doing and I don't know how to change. I am just so tired of it all. I feel invisible. He is receptive some of the time but nothing ever changes. I just wanted some effort. I feel like after everything, he would've fallen over backwards to \"prove\" how much he wanted me. ",

      "selftext": "**Sorry typo in the title.. is there redemption..**\n\nI posted this on another thread, and honestly didn't get as many perspectives as I needed.\n\n**My question is: do cheaters ever really change?**\n\nI (28f) know the answer. no. However, in my heartbreak I want to think that they can... even for their own sake.\n\nI discovered that my boyfriend (27m) of 2 years, physically cheated on me 3 times (2x sex, 1x kiss) and texted some girls with the intention to have sex with them. All of these times, he was out on coke and drinking, his excuse is that he became a monkey, horny and doesn't know why he did it, because sober he is not that kind of person. He calls out people for cheating, and hates it...\n\nWe were long distance for 2 years since July 2023, I moved this summer to his country, and everything seemed perfect. We planned on moving into an apartment together next year, he has a friend whos parent own a block of apartments and we were sold on it, and meanwhile we would stay with his parents. I was happy, genuinely happy. His parents were so welcoming and lovely.\n\nWe got a car (his parents knew family friends, so it was free - I paid nothing), and I just accepted a job offer.\n\nI found out, last week, while he was out with coworkers drinking until 5am that he texted a girl when we were dating, in dec 2023. The same night he texted her, he was texting me 'I love you' and can't wait to see each other - we were planning on a trip in Jan 2024 for my birthday.\n\nI asked him about it, he lied, got angry because I went through his ig Dm's on his desktop to find out. I felt like a horrible person, but my gut kept telling me to look. He said they just chatted, he felt bad and we had a fight, made up and decided that it was long ago.\n\nThe next morning, I continued on with my day, a bit confused, but I didn't want to leave, it felt too hard, and he assured me it was a mistake 2 years ago, around the start of our relationship.\n\nBut I had a feeling there was more, I asked him again after work, we got into an argument because I had a feeling, at 3am I asked to check his phone and he went crazy, saying his ex from his youth was the same. The next morning, he went to work - I looked again and found more messages.\n\nI will cut the fluff, but he confessed that he slept with 2x girls (dec 2023, Oct 2024), kissed one on NYE (Jan 2024).\n\nThe last time being October 2024, a few days before I flew to see him. He confided in some acquaintances, after this and they told him, that if he wanted to keep me - he must never tell and suffer with the pain and guilt.\n\nHis family and friends are shocked, I am shocked, my family and friends are shocked. And in the end, he blames alcohol and drugs turning him into a different person on these occasions. I mean his whole circle is shocked. He would never be this type of person.\n\nThe past few days I have been messaging him and we have been talking, and today I couldn't stop bringing up things and I said I would block him but I didn't have the heart. So he said he would block me for my health, because he knows I will continue to spiral. And he said he will text when he gets therapy.\n\nHe wants to change now, and I won't go back, he knows this, but says he will try to change now.\n\nI am not perfect, but I understand why sometimes people do bad things; insecurity, lack of control etc. I can't help but feel bad for him, as much as he hurt me.\n\n**Because before this happened to me, I would have always said they are scumbags, and I do believe some are absolutely irredeemable.**\n\n**But is there redemption?? If it's the alcohol and drugs, or if he's just born to be this way forever.**",

During her first day at new office, my husband tells me he heard from his male coworker that this girl said my friend (that also works with them) was spreading ‘rumours’ her and my husband were sleeping together (She also blocked me on social media, same day)\n\n- I asked my friend, she denies and confronts the girl. The girl then says she doesn’t want to be a part of childish drama and acted concerned out “how much this was affecting (my husband)”\n\n- I ask my husband if he’s going to HR now considering this is way more serious compared to just gossip. \n\n- he says he wants to just ignore it because she’s an idiot. Doesn’t want to let it bother him. Would rather focus on us. (You’d think as her manager, he’d want to clear up that rumour asap?)\n\nThe more I ask, the more he escalates, gets mad. He’s told me about 3-4 different versions of what he told his boss, different stories about what his male coworker told him, different stories about what this girl said. Then tells me he’s not changing stories.\n\nHe told me I “made a mess of everything” for asking the friend about the rumour. \nStill tells me I’m delusional, that I’m unstable etc. The more I point out inconsistencies in what he tells me, the more he calls me names and tells me I’m insane. \nTold me I’m trying to “sabotage his career”. \n\nMaybe I am delusional, or maybe it’s the constant gaslighting for weeks on end. \nI just don’t understand why this girl would block me, then start telling people there were rumours they were sleeping together?\nI also can’t understand why, if he hates her as much as he says he does and ‘wishes she would get fired’ why he wouldn’t immediately go to HR considering that type of rumour could be extremely damaging to his career?\n\nDoes this sound normal to you guys? Am I crazy? Or am I just crazy for still being with him?\n\nI feel like he is not trying at all to defend our marriage. This girl spreads a rumour they’re sleeping together, and somehow all of his anger is targeted at me, I’m the one trying to sabotage his job, and I’m the one who’s made a mess of everything.. Maybe I’m crazy for assuming most couples would want to squash a rumour like that immediately..",

He cheated with escorts, happy ending massages, onlyfans, bought other nude pics and kept it all a secret for a year and a half.\n\nI haven’t posted much . It’s been almost 4 months since D day. WH and I have started MC. I feel like there are more days when I am feeling better and coming to terms with what happened. I am finally feeling better emotionally and I’m getting better at building my self-esteem. WH is remorseful, takes full accountability, and is actively trying to change for the better. I can see he’s changing in a few ways and we’re openly /honestly communicating deeply. What he says and actually does are lining up. He’s keeping promises. I finally feel like we’re on the same page with how we want our marriage to be. However, I feel that the more that I’m healing, the more I’m starting to despise him for what he’s done in the past. \n\nSince D day I have been watching and I’m aware of things he does presently that I hadn’t noticed before. I have also noticed him checking out other women. I brought it up to him and he said he didn’t realize he was doing it. He said if in the future he did it and realized, then he’d be mindful of my feelings and stop looking. Which makes me wonder if I weren’t there if he would still look. \n\nI keep thinking how can I get past him lying and disrespecting me for a year and a half? How can I get past all of the lies he told, all of the secrets, all of the money he spent on escorts and massages. How can he change and be the man that he needs to be in order for me to stay married to him? We’re trying to reconcile and I trying to be optimistic. I feel like the more I learn, the more I am growing apart from him. I am growing to dislike the person he was/possibly still is?\n\nLately, I have been thinking more and more about divorce. I am slowly making peace with a life that doesn’t include him if things don’t work out between us. Months ago that thought terrified me. \n\nI’m thinking that if I left, hopefully I could find someone better eventually. Someone who I wouldn’t have to worry about being unfaithful. Ha honestly, I think I would worry with any new relationship I suppose. I have been traumatized and will always hold these scars. I don’t think I will ever blindly trust anyone ever again.\n\nI know it’s still early in the reconciliation process and I should give this marriage more time. I just felt the need to vent at the moment. I’m not sure if I’m looking for advice or not. I think typing this all out has helped though.\n\n",

I’ll admit I went when wife was there and caused a scene etc. But didn’t physically fight the dude or anything. It’s been maybe 2.5 years or so now? In the moment I was like, Whatever she’s not worth all this etc etc. But after the fact, I feel tons of regret on the matter. \n\nWe’re still together now, it was rocky, and still is at times. But aside from the pain and triggers and everything still being very present. I’ll get these moments where my heart will be pounding and feel adrenaline and anxiety and all that, thinking I should’ve done something and fought him and done whatever I could to fuck them up.. win-lose whatever. Going over it and over it in my head. Sometimes it becomes all consuming. Then really hard to calm down. \n\nObviously there’s not really much I can do about it now lol But just wondering on other’s experience. ",

      "title": "Still hurting after 2 years",
      "selftext": "So about 2 years ago my ex left me for his AP. We had been dating about 4 years. \n\nHe met and started pursuing the AP while he was in law school and we were long distance. He told me not to worry about her, but they would spend all day together and he would be at her house until late in the evening several times per week. They went on day trips and stayed at her parents cabin alone together without me knowing. I had my suspicions about the two of them, but felt comforted by the fact that he moved across the country (far away from her) to live with me after he graduated.\n\nI ended up spotting him $6000 while he studied for the bar exam and looked for a job.\n\nLeading up to our breakup, there was a time when she just so happened to be in town while I was conveniently out of town, and he persuaded me to allow her to stay in our apartment alone with him. I wanted to trust him, so I allowed it to happen. \n\nAbout a week later he was acting super off and wouldn’t tell me what was up, so we “took a break” because things weren’t going well. He told me he was going home to get his head on straight, but ended up flying to Colorado to go hang out with the AP (during this time he owed me 6k, was using my apartment as a storage unit, and ghosted me while I had surgery, among other hurtful things like partying and dating the AP on my dime). During this time, several of his friends confirmed that they had seen him cheating on me.\n\nA couple of months after that he finally came and got his stuff and let me know that he and AP were dating.\n\nAnd then a few months after that, I found out she was moving to my city to come live with him. It had only been about 6 months since we broke up and less than a year since he had moved in with me. He took a year to repay me, and in that time got himself a new car and paid moving expenses for the AP. I had to threaten him with legal action in order to get my money back. \n\nI have seen them walking around a couple of times since then. They are still together and happy. \n\nIt was a sequence of betrayals spanning a year that really hasn’t had a conclusion. He hasn’t taken any accountability and has only sent a generic text apologizing for “the way things went down” before blocking me. But no remorseful action and no interest in my wellbeing. \n\nI can’t begin to describe the hole that this experience has ripped in my heart. The first year after the breakup was a complete rollercoaster of shock and anger. The lingering feeling is one of tremendous loss and sadness.\n\nI feel that I have lost my ability to trust and love. I have lost pretty much all attraction to men. I feel I lost my excitement for life. I lost my future, I lost my comfort, and my sense of reality was flipped upside down. I can’t seem to find someone suitable to date, and I feel constant pressure to find someone better than him, and I feel like a failure that I can’t. \n\nIt’s strange, because I understand that I am in a better place now, safe from him. I have grown in the best ways. I am a whole new person and very independent. \n\nI do not want him back. I wouldn’t have taken him back even if he had wanted me. But the reality is that he didn’t want me. In his eyes, I was not worth care or basic consideration. I was discarded like trash and used for my money. I just wish he understood the depth of agony that I experienced with his actions as the catalyst. I wish he cared and I wish I mattered to him. \n\nThere’s no way I could have seen it coming. He was SO good to me while we were together, so I thought. I loved him dearly and would have done anything for him. \n\nAnyways, I don’t always feel this way, but I have felt extra sad with the anniversary looming. Would love to hear if anyone has experienced similar and how you cope with them still being together. ",

I still miss the person I thought was my best friend, who I thought I’d spend my life with. My experiences of dating since just remind me that I will need to do a lot of work on breaking these walls down before someone can know me as intimately as he did. \n\nI’m still friends with his mother on Facebook and just happened to see her posting a photo of him and (one of) the girls he told me not to worry about, together at the top of a mountain peak. It wasn’t a total shock, in the months after our breakup when I still followed him on social media, I saw that he had gone for coffee with her.\n\nMy mum, who’s a better internet sleuth than me, found out he’s living with her and her parents. Confusingly, and I suppose also unsurprisingly, he’s still adding songs to a playlist he created dedicated to me (in his own words), with the latest one added a week ago being The 1975’s “About You”, and other sad longing love songs about missing your soulmate effectively. \n\nSo whilst he’s now living with her, he’s trying to signal some message to me about missing me. Still, that aside, why does he get to win? Why does he get the life we spoke so much of… of worldwide travel, of a fulfilling career (he’s jumped up the career ladder so quickly since he moved out of my place), a girl who’s clearly able to fill my shoes, everything. He’s the same man, still playing the game… but no karma so far. He’s happy. Isn’t he? Why does it feel like he won?\n\nI miss him dearly even though he hate what he did. I hate that I couldn’t eat, that I lost 40kg due to stress. He underpins my life, I was a teenager when we met and my entire adult life until I left him was spent by his side, being loyal to him and devoting myself to him. \n\nI don’t know how I’ll be able to give my heart so openly to someone else now. How do you even go about trusting someone and jumping in feet first to a new relationship after this level of betrayal? It feels like that was my chance at soulmate level love, and it’s gone now. ",

My fiancé and I just had a baby together, and instead of being in the happiest time of our lives, I’m heartbroken.\n\nHe’s been acting distant and picking fights with me. I recently caught him being secretive on his phone and found messages about meeting up for sexual stuff. When I confronted him, he gave me multiple shifting excuses — first he “didn’t remember,” then said it was “for us,” then that he was “just trolling,” and finally tried to pass it off as a kink. None of it added up.\n\nOn top of that, I discovered he’s been active on a kink site meant to chat with other people about your kinks and also meet up with people. Whether or not he’s physically cheated, he’s definitely been seeking out sexual experiences and connections outside our relationship. Meanwhile, he’s trying to cover it up with love-bombing: over-the-top compliments, promises that I’m “all he’ll ever need,” talk about marriage, etc. It feels fake and manipulative now that I know the truth.\n\nThe hardest part is, I’m a stay-at-home mom. I have no income, no family nearby, and nowhere else to go. I feel completely stuck, devastated, and betrayed.\n\nI guess I’m just here because I don’t know what to do. How do I even begin to cope with this? How do I protect myself and my baby while I figure out what comes next?

I started realizing how good we were together, how well we partner with the kids, the love, the affection….\n\nThat night, less than 12 hrs later, found out my WH lied about multiple things regarding his Only Fans use. Custom video requests, tipping, messaging (although he says the messages and tips were just to buy content and not actual talking. Says it only happened 3 times). I don’t even know anymore. OF was only half of our issue, the other half private lap dances and strippers. I’m at such a loss and feel like I’m back at square one. I just let the feelings come back and the feel crushed again. I know it’s still in the virtual realm, but it feels like so much more than porn. He claims he thought of it as porn and nothing more. \n\nWe have marriage therapy in a few hours than we have been in for a couple months at this point. He had been doing everything else right up until this point. Model partner essentially. Except telling the truth. \n",

He said he looked her in the eyes and told her that cheating is a hard line for him and he left. Of course she started blowing up his phone but he never responded. \n\nHe asked me, knowing that I’ve been through this many years ago, what he should do? I’ve known these people for over 35 years and I’m stumped.

I did mention to him that this man’s wife needs to know but other than that I didn’t know what to say . My friend’s wife has no family that is still living so there will be no one to take care of her when she returns. \n\nI’ve had advice for others in this sub but I’m just too close to him to give him what I tell others.

Who in their right mind does this or even tells their SO when he had no clue?\n\n\nUpdate:\nI was just told that my friend is at the hospital but he didn’t want to talk about things. I’ll let him come to me at this point. I’m a 68 year old man sitting here writing this, with tears in my eyes. I hurt so bad for him. Damn her!!",

      "title": "Caught my dad having an affair.",
      "selftext": "This is my first time posting here, and honestly, I just need advice.\n\nWe’re from Kerala, India. My dad (54M) works in Saudi Arabia as an engineer, while my mom (49F) is a homemaker. He’s the sole breadwinner of the family. I’m 21M, and my sister is 19F. We’re both still students, so we depend entirely on him financially.\n\nTbh, my dad has always provided for us. But he also has a temper—he argues loudly over the smallest things. For as long as I can remember, my mom has struggled with his behavior. I often found myself acting as a mediator between them, just so arguments didn’t escalate into something worse. My sister and I basically grew up in a house filled with fights and harsh words.\n\nMy mom never stopped being genuine toward our family. She supported my dad even when he was struggling at work. But over time, his constant rudeness wore her down, and she started arguing back just as harshly. They’ve been married for 23 years now. Honestly, they could’ve divorced early on, but they didn’t—for our sake.\n\nSince my dad works abroad, he’s home only for about two months a year. So, it’s ten months of peace and two months of constant tension.\n\nLast year, my dad started dating a Thai woman in Saudi. Idk her age. But she looks almost 50. Let’s call her Gol. Nobody in my family knew. Then last month, he came home for his usual two-month stay.\n\nOne day, he went out to buy groceries and forgot his phone at home. Out of habit, I picked it up (I had set up my Face ID on it a couple of years ago). I noticed strange messages on Facebook Messenger. Curiosity got the better of me, so I opened it—and that’s when I found out about the affair.\n\nReading those messages broke me. From their chats, I learned that Gol is a single mom with two kids. Her husband left her six years ago. My dad met her when she was working at a beauty products shop in Saudi. He started supporting her financially, and that eventually turned into love. Despite knowing he has a family, she fell for him too. They started living together secretly. Idk whether they became physical or not.\n\nThe texts were painful to read: “I miss you,” “I want to start a new life with you,” “You understand me better than my wife.” My dad was living a double life—one with us, and one with her.\n\nAt first, I kept it to myself. I didn’t want to break my mom’s or sister’s heart, so I pretended I didn’t know. A few days later, I confronted my dad privately. He was shocked, promised me he’d cut contact with her, and begged me not to tell anyone else.\n\nBut soon enough, he went right back to texting her. This time, my sister found out. She told my mom, and everything exploded. My mom was devastated. She grabbed his phone and even took his passport so he couldn’t leave. My dad got furious, accused her of “controlling” him, and tried to justify himself by blaming her for the affair. He even reminded us that despite all this, he still provides for the family and deserves respect.\n\nWe’re exhausted. I’ve always wished for a normal family, but I don’t think I’ve had a single moment of genuine happiness in my 21 years. I don’t even feel like considering him my dad anymore. It’s been two days since I’ve properly slept.\n\nRight now, I’m torn. My plan was always to depend on him financially until I finish my studies, then take care of my mom and sister myself. But with everything falling apart, I don’t know what to do next. I need advice from this community.",

I spent the first two weeks in what we all seem to know, disbelief, depression, confusion, anger. Not a day goes by that I don’t think about it. But it was improving, I was noticing myself thinking of her less and less, but with school and work starting my social life has decreased a bit and it’s allowing me to think about her again.\n\nI realize a lot of you guys are older, and that this sub is more for marriages, but after 6 years I basically was dating her for more than 25% of my entire life. I grew up with her, and now it’s gone. I miss being someone’s boyfriend and partner, but I can’t think about her without being sick to my stomach anymore. ",

We lived together but decided to separate our living situation because it got to the point of constantly arguing. He was unemployed, collecting EDD, waking up late, sleeping late, not contributing with bills on time. Etc. \n\nWe still tried making it work. I stayed with him hoping he would change because he was never like that. I thought I could help him get sober and create better habits. But if anything I felt like the bad habits worsened and he just got better hiding it.\n\nLong story short, over the weekend he came over and left his phone in the room. Something in me decided to look at the notifications. I scrolled and saw there was a Snapchat one. I was caught off guard because we mutually agreed not to use the app a long time ago. \n\nUpon opening the Snapchat I see conversations that have all been within 24 hours. One convo was with a couple (M&F) He was sending nudes between them saying they should do coke and fuck. But all the other ones were with trans men and gay guys. From what I saw it looks like he created a fake Snapchat name and had been using it for about a week. \n\nI’m completely torn. My whole world as I knew it was a lie. I ask myself if I did something wrong ? Was it the Coke? Is this really him ? \nThere’s nothing wrong if he’s bisexual. But he was someone who I would have never thought would swing that way. If anything I thought he would cheat with other women. I wish he would’ve loved me enough to leave our relationship and do whatever he wanted to. \nHas anyone gone through anything like this ?\n\nI don’t know how to feel. I’m numb. I know I  get through this but I don’t know how. Thank you for taking the time To read.  \n\n",

He eventually admitted it but he said he has his own battles and it didn’t have anything to do with me (which I find so stupid). He said he’s moved on from it already and that it’s in the past (he was seeing one of them until 2 weeks ago). He also said that their claims were exaggerated and those women are not my friends and that they’re trying to destroy him because he ended it with them. He’s also been saying I should’ve talked to him and not them and that why am I believing random haters when we’ve been together for a long time. He thought I was snooping around and found out but I told him I didn’t even have a clue until THEY messaged me. \nHe says he can’t change the past and that he chose me so I can either accept him and move on or separate.\n\nI just can’t believe how much he’s downplaying the situation. He said he felt alone, it was only physical and that it was a mistake. He says that I should forgive him because marriage is about the good, the bad and the ugly. I told him that now that he’s done playing around he expects me to just accept him again because he’s done and is now ready to be a family man? I just told him that he destroyed whatever vision I had of our family and that I can’t stay with him after this. He said that I can make the choice to keep our family together and I’m choosing not to and I told him he was the one who destroyed our family, not me. He said that he has been a good husband to me and that our years together should count for something. I told him that yeah you were a good husband and I believed it all this time until I found out about how he’s been seeing so many women behind my back.\n\nAgain he insists that it was just physical and they don’t mean anything to them. I said it doesn’t matter- he cheated. And he still insists it matters. Make it make sense.\n\nI’m really lost and I’m shaking, I don’t know what’s next. I hate that I’m living this nightmare.",

I’m in my late 20s and can say I have a pretty strong self esteem since the time I was young. I can’t imagine what being cheated on feels like for anyone who already struggles with self esteem. But this really does rock your whole perspective on yourself because at the end of the day, you technically weren’t “enough” in some aspect of your partners life, even if they cheated down with someone who has nothing to offer them, no matter how “good” your relationship seemed to be. My question is basically- does external validation almost make it worse for you post D Day? When other men compliment me or anything, I’m so grateful but there’s an inner voice that still thinks of my partner and how the whole world could think highly of you, but you still weren’t enough for someone.

      "selftext": "Hi everyone, this is my first time being here and though I've read the rules, I'm not sure if this post is appropriate (I'm seeking advice for a friend instead of myself). If it is not, please remove/ delete it.\n\nSo straight to her story: My friend is over a decade married and moved to a foreign country with her husband. They shared a joined business where she also contributed financially (she is both a major shareholder as well as a key member who directly ran the business. However, she has dedicated her time and effort to the business, to the point of ignoring every other aspects of life: she is still not fluent in the host country's language (currently at level A2 - so still a beginner), and she entrusted all the bookkeeping and salary and funds management to her husband. She hardly went anywhere in the past decade. Her world revolved around her husband and the business, until the day she found out he cheated with a colleague from their joint business. At first they agreed to part ways amicably. However, when the husband demanded that he had the business to his own and their apartment (so basically she would be left with nothing), she disagreed, and he went straight to court, suing her for stealing from the business. They are currently going through a messy divorce where he's trying to exert financial pressure on her, so that she would have to leave the country empty-handed (he adjusted the books to make it look like the business had suffered a bad year in an attempt to make the profits \"disappear\" so he could avoid splitting their joint properties with her). He has the advantage of being a native speaker in his own home country, is financially sound and can afford a top lawyer, has a smidge more shares than her and already terminates her working contract. She is building her life back from scratch while going through this emotional turmoil, is having difficulty standing up for herself, partly because she is very gentle in nature, not at all confrontational and partly because she is not confident in her language ability. She has only a few friends to rely on now for emotional support and is also in a financially sensitive position.\n\nI feel for her and want to help. She has found herself a good lawyer, but is constantly worried about his threat and her future. Would a good lawyer be able to tip the scale in the cheater's favour (I'm admittedly ignorant when it comes to law)? What are some of the most important things she could do now to pick herself backup, especially emotionally, as I feel how one feels might impact how one acts? What can I do for her as a friend to help her navigate this difficult time in her life? For a bit of context, we are in Austria. Are there any books or articles or law sections I can read up and share with her, so she might have some reassurance that things will not go the cheater's way (as I would also desperately hope for her sake)? \n\nAny help would be much appreciated. Thank you very much in advance!",

He doesn’t know I know. \nI always said I would leave when I got my shit together… I’m still gathering the courage. \nWe have now two kids and I’m just trying to navigate this as best as possible. \n\nRight now my husband is working a lot because I don’t get maternity leave, so he is my sole financial provider, so his time is mostly accounted for. \n\nAnyway, AP keeps texting… teasing constantly with photos of them being intimate, sending nudes, etc and it always blindsides me just when I think we are in a “good place” . \n\nToday she said something that made me think. She was reminiscing about a time when my husband was single bc it’s so hard for them to meet up now a days.\n\nAnd now I can’t stop thinking that this is exactly what she wants. To break us up. And when I finally leave him… he’ll go to her and she will have everything she wants while I get to have a broken home and struggle as a single mom for the rest of my life. \nI don’t want to let her “win”. Not saying my husband is a prize… he is a pos but at least on paper he is still mine. He works to provide for me and my kids, he is a good dad to my children, and at the end of the day, he comes home to me, not her. And tbh I take a little satisfaction knowing she can’t have him the way she wants. I know it’s petty, but I hate AP and I don’t want her to be happy. \n\nI feel like I can’t win either way…\nI don’t want to stay with a cheater but I also don’t want to leave a man I love so he can go be with another girl and break my family apart forever :( \n\nThanks for reading. \n",

      "selftext": "It’s been 10 months since I discovered my WH’s affair, and the journey since then has been a rollercoaster of emotions. I’ve asked him to leave a few times, but he always pleads with me to give us another chance. Sadly, we never seem to make any real progress.\n\nI suggested therapy, but he said he couldn’t afford it, so we just carried on with life. Two weeks ago, though, he reached out to our pastor and scheduled a session because he felt I was in too much pain. That conversation turned out to be very meaningful, and for the first time in a long while, we were both able to open our hearts.\n\nHe shared that he has been struggling with reconciliation because, from his perspective, I was unkind, often brought up the past, and didn’t show him respect. He said this made him shut down. The pastor gave us an assignment: he was to find ways to make me feel loved, while I was to focus on showing him respect. We were to return after two weeks and share whether I felt loved and whether he felt respected.\n\nBut here’s where I’m struggling: the only thing I can think about is the depth of the disrespect he showed me. He betrayed me. He lied. He allowed his AP to speak ill of me. He shared my intimate messages with her. He even brought her into my home. The level of disrespect was beyond comprehension. So now I’m left asking—how can I respect him?",

      "title": "6 months since my world came crashing down",
      "selftext": "Hello all, I have posted my story before but here is a quick recap.  I have been married to my best friend and partner for 15 years. He is my 2nd husband. I was truly happy in my marriage - we laughed together, liked the same things, we always kind to each other and got along great.  He was my best friend and the best husband I could have asked for...until 6 months ago.  \n\nHe travels for work about 40% of the time. I went to NY to visit with him in the middle of one of his longer trips.  He was at work and I was using an old Ipad to watch movies. He must not have realized that this Ipad synced with his phone for a period of time 12/22-10/24.  There were texts on there of him setting up meetings with young asian prostitutes.  Different cities, different times of day but always an asian prostitute.  I confronted him and he admitted that this is something he has struggled with, on and off, his whole adult life. He said he started doing it again 8 years into our marriage and, it had escalated to about 2-3 times/months over the past 2 years.  That is well over 100 women.\n\nSuffice it to say, I did not handle this well.  I kicked him out and went into complete shutdown mode for 3 months.  Couldn't sleep, couldn't eat, couldn't stop crying.  Panic attacks, dissassociation, the whole works.  I have never felt that kind of pain in my entire life.  I am holding it together better now but am always just a trigger away from tears.  \n\nHe started therapy, 2X per week - 1 talk therapy sessoin and 1 EMDR session/week.  He has been doing that for 5 months. During that time, he uncovered that he was raped for a period of 3 years (3rd-7th grad) and had completely blocked that out.  His therapist says that he isn't a sex addict but he did have uncontrolled sexual behavior brought on by childhood trauma.  She says that he was using that as a numbing out coping mechanism.  He also uncovered that it was triggered again, after over 10 years of not doing it, because, when his mom died his aunt asked him if he was ever sexually assaulted as a child (I was there when she asked that) and he denied it (and beleived the denial) but apparently this created a crack in the box he had locked all of this up in and the poison started seeping out.  His counselor has explained to me the why behind why is was always prostitutes (transactional sex) and the reason he felt like he couldn't tell me (he feld dirty and worthless and has so much shame and guilt).\n\nLogically, I understand the WHY behind what he did.  I understand how his childhood trauma led to his actions.  I have SO much empathy for that little boy who was raped over and over again and for the broken man he became. \n\nAll of that said, I am completely torn on what to do.  Do I try to give us another chance?  Can I put what he did behind me?  If I do, does that mean I don't respect myself?  \n\nEven though I understand, that does't help the hurt.  Also, whild all of that is true, he still made the choice to not get help, he still looked me in the face and lied to me for 7 years.  He slept with SO many other women.  Does he deserve another chance?  Does what happened to him as a child matter when making this decision?  \n\nEveryone keeps telling me to do what will make me happy - and to do what I want to do but I truly have no idea what that is and I am no closer to being able to decide than I was 6 months ago.\n\nHas anyone been through something similar?  Does anyone have any thoughts or guidance that might help?  I feel like I am losing my mind and that this CAN NOT really be my life.  I am completely and utterly exhaused to my core all the time from the emotional drain.  Any help would be appreciated.",

He said it was like dating a 24 year year old version of himself (he’s 34, and I was like yeah.. duh..) and apparently she ended it a few weeks ago but they’re still good friends \n\nHe also finally admitted that he doesn’t hate me, and that he loves and misses me. He regrets cheating. And knows he’s been taking his anger out on me by saying super mean stuff to me. \n\nIt was super late and he wanted me to stay and he would sleep on the couch but I said no. He also definitely tried to kiss me and I said no. \n\nDONT FEAR WE’RE NOT GETTING BACK TOGETHER!!!! I could never. He’s put me through hell. \n\nBut it was really healing to hear those things since he totally avoidant discarded me and has been telling me he hates me, he was never happy etc etc. \n\nI think that now we’re not together, I’m seeing someone new and he’s hit rock bottom in every sense (alone, totally broke and in debt, lost his job, going to court for a DUI).. he’s realizing I wasn’t the whole problem ",

(Two hours in the morning and two hours in the evening) My sister and I invented games of our own to play in the pool, we challenged each other to race across the length of the swimming pool multiple times, using different strokes each time. And whenever we grew tired, we’d just float on our backs in the water, our limbs outstretched. And floating like that, that was the most calm I felt in years. \n\nAfter we were done swimming, we were rushing back to our suite because we couldn’t wait to take a shower and rush to the dinner buffet, we were famished. That walk back to our suite, I remember thinking to myself that this is the happiest I’ve been in years and that I would cherish this day forever. I felt genuinely happy.\n\nWhen I was standing in the shower, that’s when it hit me like a train. I couldn’t stop thinking about one of the D-Days when I found those photos on my partner’s phone: them with another person in a resort, a picture of them hugging each other, a picture of them in a museum, a picture of them on their dinner date at that resort. \n\nIn the past, I’ve found nude pictures and videos of my partner with multiple people. Call me crazy, but these normal museum date pictures hurt me more than having to watch videos of my partner sleep with someone else, because these pictures of them hugging and going on museum dates felt so much more than a fling, it seemed like a happy relationship, it seemed like they were in love and it broke my heart.\n\nAnyway, in the shower, I cried until I couldn’t breathe. I realised that I could no longer be genuinely happy: all my good moments would be tainted by the infidelity. \n\nEver since the first D-Day, I feel utterly worthless and the ugliest person alive. But this realisation broke me in ways I didn’t know was possible.",

      "selftext": "Hey guys. First time posting here. My husband and I (referred to now as my ex) have honestly been miserable for many years. We were together for about 9. Unhappy for about 5, since I gave him a child. Post partum hit me hard and I took time off my RN job during covid to be a stay at home mom. In this time, my husband treated me terribly. Like a child that didnt deserve  to be heard. No respect. He would also stay out late after work running the roads. Once I found a pair of scrub pants in his car which he had a less than ideal excuse for. Once we separated  for a year and did marriage counseling. \n\n\nHe started Adderall a few years ago and it changed his personality. He was always thoughtless, unintelligent, and didnt want responsibility. But now he was dopamine seeking. Both before and after i returned to work, I would catch him spending tons of money he didnt have on app purchases. He also became more belligerent and aggressive. Then earlier this year he overhauled his appearance. Started wearing street shirts and shoes to work and changing there. It was all very bizarre. He promised he wasn't cheating on me. He did finally agree to life 360 and to stop running the roads. \n\nFast forward to 2 months ago---- i finally uncovered that he had a horrific porn addiction. He couldnt control himself. The worst part is how much he lied to me. See, he told me the ENTIRE TIME WE WERE TOGETHER that he never self pleasured or watched ANY adult content-- he said he only felt right saving all of himself for me. Then he lied even with evidence, over and over, to the point that the evidence showed this was an obsession and the lies reflected that. \n\nI had to go through and see the extent of what he had done and if he had actually tried to cheat or just watch content- I ended up seeing the girls he liked, the content he watched. F*tishes he had never told me about after 9 years together that I would have acted out with him 😭😭 over this time when he was exposed he became more and more intimidating toward me, began to throw things at me, get in my face threaten to hit and punch me. \n\nI finally asked him to leave because he said he couldnt guarantee that he wouldnt threaten to hurt me anymore. and he escalated the situation badly. He repetitively refused to leave and had me cornered. I was scared and didnt know what to do, and finally I lost it and popped him across the face. I immediately jerked back as I realized I had fucked up when I panicker and he yelled \"im going to k*ll you!\" and proceeded to strangle me. He shifted his entire body weight into it and I could barely pass any air. I alternated with begging to stay alive for my children with trying to breathe enough to stay conscious. Id beg until I saw gray around the edges of my vision then I would beg more. Finally he let go. He lied to the cops and they almost arrested me. \n\nThen I sent him back to his momma. Before I got my EPO, I led him along partially for my safety and partially to see if he had changed. Then one night I got him to screen share his phone and he had been doing all the same stuff just lying about it still. After I said its over I was afraid of retaliation and him coming to finish me off so I had the epo go through. I was smart and although the cops didnt believe me I followed up with lots of medical care and documentation as I had fingerprint bruises around my neck the next morning.\n\n\nNow I am struggling with the aftermath. I feel so alone and worthless. I trust Noone. The worst part is how s*xually inferior i feel. I cant even self pleasure without imagining if he did cheat and who all he has been with since I left. But why does that matter, I almost d*ed. I am still having to work full time. I just want to get the images of him m*sturbating and other things out of my head. I need to accept that its over over and it was over for him along time ago. Why am I even upset that i lost someone that almost took away my children's mother? I have bpd but for the first time in my life I cant even imagine another partner or sleeping with anyone. I just want to crawl in a hole alone forever. I see my therapist this week. Any advice?",

      "title": "Seven months ago I was sucker punched by my wife’s AP in a bar",
      "selftext": "Seven months ago I discovered my wife was having an affair.  I am now ready to leave and I owe this reddit a great deal of thanks. Reading through the posts here helped navigate these past few months. This is not new to me. I have worked through many of the emotions so if I come off as not caring or just posting the facts it's because of that.  Believe me when I say I have been through an emotional ringer these past months.  I just want to get the facts out and ask for some opinions. Sorry it's so long.\n\nSeven months ago I was sucker punched by my wife’s AP in a bar. My wife, her brother and his wife, and my wife’s best friend and her husband decided to grab drinks after attending a concert.  I don’t drink so I became the designated driver as usual. At one point the ladies went to the restroom and two came back but my wife did not.  Her best friend stated she was having some stomach trouble and would be along shortly.  After a few minutes, I needed to go myself so I went to the restroom.  As I made my way through the crowd I spotted my wife standing and talking to a man.  He had his hand on her hip and she had hers on his shoulder.  It struck me as a very intimate pose.  She noticed me immediately and disengaged with the man as I reached them.  She grabbed my arm to pull me back toward our table as I asked who he was.  The guy replied none of your business and at the same time my wife pulled me again.  As I turned to her to ask her again who this was, the guy punched me on the side of the head.  I stayed on my feet but I immediately felt myself going back.  He had tackled me and slammed me against the wall hard enough to where I blanked out.  I could hear but I could not see or make sense of what was going on.  He apparently punched me at least twice before my brother-in-law tackled him and proceeded to beat him senseless.  This was relayed to me later.  My next coherent thought was in an ambulance.  The AP was taken to the emergency room and later arrested.  My BIL was arrested but charges dropped and I stayed in the emergency room overnight and into the next day to rule out any side effects of a concussion.\n\n I was interviewed by the police eventually and they seemed surprised that I did not know the man that attacked me.  They said my wife told them it was a misunderstanding and that the guy was someone she worked and got handsy and everyone just overreacted. A day or two later my BIL, who had been very cold toward my wife since that night came by and sat down and explained he needed to tell me something.  Apparently while I was  knocked loopy the guy kept telling everyone he had been fucking my wife for months.  Obviously I was completely stunned at this.  He told me he didn’t have proof but he believed the guy was telling the truth. He struggled with telling me so he did some research on how the best way to handle this was and he realized that it was the right thing to do to tell me.  He used reddit as part of his research and recommended I join and read some of the posts about infidelity and make a decision on how to handle this.  That's when I joined reddit and this account was born. It didn’t take long to realize that I needed to get my emotions under control and start looking for facts.  Apparently gaslighting and rewriting history is common and I am one hundred percent sure my wife would do this.  So I cried, yelled, punched, etc.  I got it out of my system as much as I could.  That night when she came home I could barely contain myself but everyday it got a little easier. Two days later I was able to get a hold of her phone and did a quick search and there it was.  Pictures, texts, videos, etc.  All of it.  She didn’t even try to hide it.  She’s not tech savvy but then again she knew I never checked her phone.  Over the next few days I was able to copy the texts between them and the pictures and videos.  Eventually I checked other texts and realized her BFF was helping her hide it and was encouraging it. The BFF actually confesses to having her own affair a few years ago. I exported those texts.   \n\nMy BIL and I made the mutual decision to exclude him from any further information the day he told me but I did reach out to my sister.  Her and her husband have rental property and they promised to give me a heads up when they have a home open up so I can have a place to stay.  That took almost six months but I now have a home I can rent and I am able to finally leave.  It's been horrible these past few months acting like I care about our marriage and trying to love a person I have been married to for 32 years and together for 35 years.  Yes we have had sex during this time.  Not often.  It has not been gentle I am ashamed to say nor has it been to satisfy her in any way.  It's basically been very impersonal.  A means to an end.  I have to act like I did not see the videos and pictures she made with him and for him.  Or read the I love yous in their texts.  Or when he texted her three days after hitting me and bragged about taking me down so quickly and her replying with a smiley face emoji. The pain that level of betrayal brings is beyond bearing at times.\n\nWith that, I am now ready to leave. I have divorce papers in hand.  I have an envelope full of copies of the texts, pictures, and stills from the videos.  I know who he is and where he lives.  I know who his wife is and where she works.  I even know his children's name and where they go to school.  I am torn about disrupting their lives but I am most definitely going to send a copy of everything to his wife.\n\nI am struggling with confrontation or ghosting. I understand the dangers of confronting her and how she can play it into a situation where I could get arrested but I truly want to see her face when I show her everything I know.  Maybe it's having to stay quiet for all these months but I really want that view of shock and possibly shame when I tell her. But I can also see the benefit of just leaving it on the counter and walking away.  This may be silly to ask everyone but until now I have had a clear goal to gather and prepare to leave but now I have a choice and would like some opinions.\n\nSome quick info about us.  Finances are separate with a joint/checking savings.  I have a larger retirement but she has a pretty well funded one herself.  We sold our family home two years ago and bought a small empty nesters home.  Paid cash and invested the rest in retirement.  I am male 58 and she is  female 57.  We both have taken good care of ourselves physically and she is every bit a beautiful woman.  The AP is 35.  We have three children 31m 28f and 25f.  The oldest is married and the other two are living on their own with solid careers and stable relationships.  If I ghost her I will need to contact them and talk to them so they do not worry.  I plan to either confront this week or ghost next weekend while she and her BFF have a shopping trip to a major city 2 hours away planned.\n\n***Update 1 ***\"\n\nWow!  This really has been overwhelming in less than 24 hours. I've had a lot of questions and a lot of great opinions. I'll try to answer some of the common questions:\n\nShe has shown only a slight concern early on after the assault that I might suspect something. Last I looked at her phone was over a month ago and she was completely back into the affair with no mention of me knowing.  They stopped meeting up for about three weeks after the assault. But continued sexting and sending videos. She did express a need to stop before she lost her family but as of last month they were still meeting up and having sex.\n\nHe was arrested and did a plea deal for simple assault. Spent Saturday night, Sunday, and Monday in jail until he was released on bail. Got community service and paid some court fines. \n\nWife explained away the guys claims by saying he had a crush on her and was just drunk. \n\nI plan on telling the OBS, the BFFs husband and notifying HR at their work. I have a plan for them.\n\nI'll tell our kids. She is a good mother. I'm not sure of the circumstances that have resulted in her making the choices but she is still their mother and not once has she been neglectful to them or their needs. \n\n\nAgain thank you all for your advice and the many of you have made some really good arguments for both ghosting and confrontation. Plus I appreciate the precautions you have suggested in case I confront her.\n\n***Update 1.5***\nAgain just to answer some things that have come up in the comments. \n\nI have taken an STD test since the last time we had sex which has been awhile.  Clean.\n\nMy lawyer has paperwork completed and we have a proposal that is fair and the lawyer doesn't care how she is  served just as long as there are police involved or abuse. \n\nAlimony is a thing but due to my situation and the fallout from my exposure there are backup plans in our proposed divorce settlement. I'll leave that alone for now. But suffice to say there will probably be a cost but not something I'm worried about. Again since I have plans to contact all that have been affected I'm sure there will be a certain financial cost especially if she loses her job. I'm not worried about anyone else. Can't get sued for exposing facts. \n\nI'm not interested in suing anyone even if I could ( not sure). The energy I'm expending right now and have over the past few months is not worth it to me to get some nominal court ruling. \n\nI have pretty much concluded that ghosting is the right thing. I have read how others have done it on here and I will probably utilize some of their tactics. \n\nI have a plan to get one more look at her phone later this week. I have not looked at it for some time but an opportunity has come up that all but ensures I can look and have a very very low risk of getting caught. I don't want to get this far and screw it up now. \n\nShe has been more...present lately. I really haven't noticed it until this morning. Not sure what is going with that. And what I mean is she's back to asking about my day. Going out of her way to kiss me bye and hello. After reflecting a little this seems to have started about a week ago so something has shifted I think. That's another reason why I want to look at her phone again. Not that it will change anything but this will be the final time I have an unfiltered view of what has been going on. Once I ghost her I won't be able to gather anymore information. \n\nFinally I don't plan on going into gory details with my children. I will tell them but honestly the conversation will just happen naturally. I cannot in anyway plan out that conversation. \n\nThanks again everyone for your help and support. I'll probably go quiet until afterwards at this point.  I'm already worried about giving too much info out. \n",

I told him everything about my past. About how horribly my first relationship went, my childhood traumas, my insecurities, everything.

      "selftext": "I've read posts about people who do post nuptial agreements with an infidelity clause after a finding out about infidelities. Ive already read that these rarely hold up in court. Does any one have experience with getting a postnup WITHOUT such a clause?\n\n Everyone says that once infidelity starts (or is found out, ha), your marriage is over. Marriage #1 has failed. And you can decide on if you want to build a new marriage through reconciliation- marriage #2.\n\nI have not committed in either direction on what I am going to do- all options are on the table at this point. So I'm considering the steps I'd take in either direction.\n\nIf I do decide to try Reconciliation, we'd be starting a new marriage. The way i see it, if I was single and got married now, in my 40s, you bet I'd get a prenup. So I'm thinking a postnup makes perfect sense. I heard someone call a postnup a \"pre-divorce settlement\" in a derogatory way, but I think thats exactly what it is I want. A lay out of what a divorce would look like, in case either of us wants to NOPE out at any time. I have zero desire to go through a messy divorce, fight for assets, custody. I have no interest in the postnup being punitive in any way. No infidelity clause because 1) if they don't hold up in court, what's the use? 2) the divorce arrangement would be the same no matter why we are getting a divorce. I want an equitable arrangements for both parties, before we really start to hate each other.\n\nAlso, I just don't want the fear of a messy divorce to cloud my judgement if I do decide to try reconciliation. I don't want fear to drive me in either direction, or anger. I want whatever happens to be amicable- for my own sanity, but mostly for my kids. They deserve parents who don't hate each other. A messy divorce, or even a divorce when we are feeling angry at one another, will be bad for the kids.\n\nJust wondering if anyone has experience with this and how it turned out for them. I will be consulting a lawyer soon.\n\nFor context, I am the betrayed wife. We both have full time jobs, but I make a fair bit more money than him. At this juncture, I'd like to keep the house, for our girls. I would assume all payments if I was the only one living here, of course. But that would involve him giving up his equity in the house.",

But there's some Limits that I wanted to see. I've read in a book of the topic that I needed to give to her some opportunity and with that, we could start to rebuild. I give to her some confidence and I only wanted in exchange a real and tangible proof about she also wanted to try. The proof I've asked her was she show me that relationship have ended. An she not only cannot prove it, she were still speaking with that guy in a romantic way (well, I'm not 100% sure, she didn't wanted to show me their chats). \n\nMaybe it was a bit extreme to ask see the messages, but in this situation, I was assuming that I could ask for enough proofs to keep feeding my confidence. Well, with all the pain into my heart as we say in Mexico, and I don't wanted to do it, I ended it. I've chose myself. \n\nIn the end, she entered in a shock and told me she will end it in that moment, but she had so many time to do it, why she waited so long and only when she had the rope in the neck? In this moment I don't trust in anything that she says to me. \n\nMaybe was not the best way to say goodbye but she promised me in the end that she would work in therapy, will had time alone to think in what she has done and be the best version of herself, and will wait for me all the necessary. I don't care if she returns, that doesn't mean that a little part of me hopes that, the thing that I want is she would be fine. But that's not my business anymore, and i admit that it's hard for me to say it. I'll work on me and search into my heart if in some years could we give us another chance.\n\nLife plans, good morning messages, welcome kisses, what have you eaten today, shall we go eat tacos de tripa tonight? I've got you a Kit-Cat, I know you love it! Where do you wanna go holidays in Christmas? The daily life is the thing that I will miss more than the sex, the Instagram posts together, etc. But I'm in therapy, I have friends, I have the reddit community, I'm not alone, even if I feel like the world is completely empty.",

That I should be grateful that he has a job to support our family. And his family is amazing. I dread losing them and feeling awkward. And i should just suck it up and be miserable so our kids can be happy. Ive been doing just that for almost 6 years. I have so much resentment. So much anger towards him. \nWe've talked about him moving out as a first step. But I just can't imagine his side of the closet being empty yet making him pay the mortgage. Him living in some crappy place while I have the house and he's paying for it, paying for my car, paying the utilities for a place he doesn't live in any more. He's the one that madr horrible choices not giving a F about us.  Why do I still feel guilty. Just venting... I'm mid 40's with an elementary and preschool aged kid. I don't know how I'm gonna do this on my own. Yes, Im looking for a job. I'm just so sad. Sad for our kids... ",

      "title": "Do I try to save the marriage?Husband (28M) repeatedly lied throughout our 4 year marriage",
      "selftext": "Hi, posting here because the hurt is fresh and I’m not sure what to do or how to move forward.\n\nI (30F) have been married to my husband (28M) for four years now. We had a short dating period, and a short engagement before marrying in 2021. Dating and engagement was all long-distance, as we didn’t move in together until after we were married. \n\nAfter a year of marriage, I went through his phone. He was pretty good about cleaning everything up, but when I downloaded his Snapchat Data, I found out that he had tried to initiate sex with another woman during the first month of being exclusive with each other. I also found many flirtatious messages with other women that he had sent when we were still in the “talking” phase, which hurt, but we weren’t an official couple yet so I can’t hold that against him. \n\nI decided to forgive him and work through it with him. He never gave girls his phone number and Snapchat was cleared of any women acquaintances. We ended up having two children back to back and I thought our marriage was doing okay. I frequently asked him if anything else has happened that he needs to tell me about, and his answer was always “no”. \n\nA few months ago, he rediscovered Jesus and became a “changed man”. He stopped drinking, stopped playing video games, and started praying and reading the Bible for hours a day. \n\nLast night, he told me that he had something to tell me and he admitted that he’s struggled with a porn addiction for the entirety of the relationship. For the past five years, he’s sworn up and down that porn is terrible and that he hadn’t used it since we’d been dating. So when he admitted this, it hurt to hear, but I knew that we could work through it with therapy. But then he admits that while he was away in Mississippi for a military training, he got drunk and grinded-on and made out with one of his coworkers. This was while I was home in Missouri with our first baby, who was three weeks old at the time and I was suffering with PPD. I had known that he went out that night, and even had a strong gut feeling that something had happened. When he had gotten home from the bar that night I remember asking him over and over again if something had happened and he insisted nothing did. To make matters worse, when I finally joined him in Mississippi three weeks later, he and I both went to game night with two of his buddies and the female coworker he had made out with just weeks prior. I was suspicious, so I went through his phone shortly after and found that she had messaged him wanting to meet up at a bar about a week after they kissed, while I was still in Missouri. He had declined going, and I know this is truthful because I checked Life360 and when checking the times, we were FaceTiming for most of that night. When I found this out, I confronted him about it and he continued to deny that anything had happened between them. And he kept that lie up until yesterday.\n\nHe also let me know that, just last Fall, while we had a 1.5 year old at home and while I was seven months pregnant, he got very very drunk and was out with coworkers. He ended up grinding-on/feeling up two of his female coworkers. No kissing that time, apparently. \n\nAgain, this all came out last night. I’m devastated. Is it worth it to even try to fix this, or is it a lost cause? He shows a lot of resentment for his actions, and he has been sober since January with no intentions of ever drinking again. He says he’s willing to do anything and everything I would ask of him in order to try and make the marriage work. I just don’t know. ",

I feel like I don’t know life without him. My heart is shattered and I don’t know what to do with all this pain. I want to go back because he’s been going to therapy and is now exactly the man I always wanted and I think he’s actually changing for the better. He’s dying to get back with me too But my family and friends all hate him and will not accept him if I go back. They also think he’s just manipulating me and hasn’t changed but giving me the illusion that he has. So in all i know I can’t and a chance of him cheating again may be high. \n\nWhat sucks is I still only have eyes for him. I only find him attractive and no one else. I’m not even interested in anyone else anymore. I just want him. And what sucks is I can’t fathom the idea of him finding a new girl and her meeting and getting close to his family like I was. And him being now changing and being that perfect guy to a new girl and not me. \n\nWhat do I do I’ve never been so heartbroken in my life I just want my best friend back I miss and love him so much and don’t want to have him leave my life permanently. But I can’t go back to him. What do I do help💔😭😭",

My STBX had an emotional affair with a subordinate, was on dating apps, kept lying, deceiving, and making my life utter hell for the two years of our supposed \"reconciliation.\" So many times, I didn't want to be on this planet any longer, and this sub ended up being one of the greatest and fiercest sources of support for me. Thanks for that.\n\nFinally, earlier in 2025, I moved back to my home state to be closer to family and friends. STBX was actually the one to decide he wanted to divorce. At the time, it seemed like an utter tragedy, but it turns out it was the best gift of my life. I have a great support system here. I get to see my son and daughter-in-law whenever I want. And I met someone! I never, ever thought it could happen, but it did. It's so, so much better than living with a liar, deceiver, and betrayer.\n\nSo, my son is getting married tomorrow. I am THRILLED. I have been thinking a lot about STBX's absence from the wedding, but I also know it is for the absolute best. This was my second marriage, and STBX was simply never interested in my son or, really, in any family outside of his parents and sister. His fragile feelings would have needed to be managed the entire day. He doesn't like social events. He doesn't like anyone in my life. He doesn't like vegetables or most foods that are not on his small list of acceptable things to eat, so he'd have been scowling and sulking, as was his way, if his sister couldn't be his emotional support person at an event. Of course, he'd have wanted to leave early.\n\nI know there will be moments tomorrow where it feels weird not to have STBX there. We were together for 20 years. But now? I get to enjoy the day and celebrate my son and daughter-in-law. They will be surrounded by love.\n\nIt's a shame STBX never wanted to be part of a loving family, but in the end, life is so much richer and full of hope and promise for me.\n\nThanks, all.\n\n\\*\\*\\*Edited to add: The wedding was AMAZING! I thought of STBX for a few moments early on, while I was getting dressed and ready. But that was it. I forgot about his existence for the rest of the day, and no one mentioned him. Not even once. ",

      "selftext": "So my wife and I are both in our late 30s.  Been married for 11 years, dated for 4, have 2 kids.\n\nLittle bit of backstory.\n\n  \nI've always been the \"kinky one\", I had all these fantasies about hotwifing, threesomes, etc. At first my wife was on board, then it became an issue to her.  I got told it was something married people shouldn't do, that if I really wanted to do it I should find another woman because she isn't it, etc.  It felt like kinkshaming because instead of trying to understand why I was into it, or anything like that I was made to feel like I was the issue.  That I was weird, that I should change.\n\n  \nIt got to be big enough of a deal that I went to solo therapy this year. Talked things out and I felt better.  And then a bomb happened.  I found out she had an affair 1 year after we got married with an ex boyfriend she went to high school with.  She did it once and then buried it inside like nothing happened but kept talking to the guy.  I caught them talking and made them stop, but when I was in therapy I was bouncing back and forth with my therapist and put 2 and 2 together.  I confronted her and she admitted to it.\n\n  \nNow it's been 10 years since the affair happened at this point, and she claims to have forgotten all the details I feel I want to know (Why it happened, what happened, etc).  She claims to not remember most of anything where I remember details of hookups I had prior to us even dating.\n\n  \nNow all of this is long in the past but still new and fresh to me.  I still struggle with looking at her with my kids (and they are 100% my kids) and I feel betrayed.  I want to make things work but damn, does it sting that I went through a period thinking she thought I was weird/strange for having my desires and wanting to experience them with her, but she went out on her own and had sex with an ex with what sounded like a \"He wants me to have sex with someone else? Fine I'm gonna go do it and not tell him\" sort of thing.\n\n  \nHas anyone else experienced anything similar? I feel it's a weird situation because I wanted to try something with her and she went off on her own and did it in secret while shaming me for even having the desire in the first place.",

The cognitive dissonance I think I have is not normal. I have been trying to accept this but I just don’t know why I cannot. It’s robbing me of motherhood. \n\nTogether 10years, married 4. I found out about the affair 3 weeks postpartum, he was kicked out and we he been separated since it’s been 9 months. He has been at his family home. In that time he has cycled between being mean, and saying he wants to work things out. Very conflicting. Looking back it’s mainly words. \n\nHe went on holiday two weeks ago with his father and I just discovered online after digging (looking through social media), he left his father in a local town and drove 6 hours to the other part of the country, and clear as day him in a restaurant with AP smiling and laughing in the background. In that time his phone never connected etc. it’s feels like d-day all again, he is back with the woman he ruined his family for, they look so happy laughing together. He looks happy.

How do I do it so I have the last laugh. I feel so sad and violated. \n\nI) i do I do it while he is away? He is on affair high giving his coldness so that might push him to stay away longer with her and he won’t feel impacted . \n2)Do I Wait for him to come back (he thought he could move in to our new home after his trip) and do it the day he lands? We haven’t been under the same roof since he got kicked out. \n3)I wanted him to taste family life, do I let him settle in then do it?

      "selftext": "TL;DR History of being cheated on and lied to in relationships, it happened again recently and I'm just so tired of it, wtf are people doing? Where the hell are the good ones at? Does it ever get better?\n\nBefore I get started, I have a therapist that I've been seeing for 8 years now(they started out as my couples therapist, thats a fun story). They know what I'm going through and are so supportive and understanding. I think this post is going to be a mix of venting and looking for advice. I just discovered this subreddit today and if there's anyone who will hopefully understand what I'm feeling its yall. Thank you in advance for reading.\n\nIn my life so far I've had two long term relationships, one of which was a marriage, and one short term relationship that I really hoped would turn into something stable and long lasting. All were with people that I deeply cared about. All of them have resulted in discovering infidelity and deceit either during or after the fact. I know that I am not causing people to cheat, they are responsible for their actions, and I don't feel like I'm blaming myself at all, I know I've done nothing wrong, but holy shit it's like there's this emotional intertia built up and its so heavy and it makes me inherently suspicious of new potential partners before they even get a chance to show me that they're not a liar or a cheat. Just being on the apps looking at all of the people on there, it's like I am at the guillotine, waiting for the executioner to drop the blade on my neck before anything has even happened. \n\nMy first long term relationship was with someone I went to high school with, we were together for four years and we went to separate colleges for a bit. I found out after we had broken up that she had cheated on me about a month or so before we broke up. I did not imagine or think it would happen, who does, you know? And of course, it was the one I was told \"don't worry about him, he's just someone from class.\" Yeah, sure, the guy who likes the same music as me, looks similarly to me, you talk about him every day. Sure, I don't need to worry about him...I needed to worry about her... thanks to her, I learned that the people in my partner's life who become very imporant almost unreasonably quickly to them are indicators of infidelity. She impacted my capability to trust when a partner says that someone is just a friend. That day, thanks to her, I learned that in relationships I needed to look over my shoulder in a certain way. Are they *really* just a friend...\n\nMy second long term relationship was with someone I met through college. A classmates/friends ex(***never*** doing that again). We were together for almost 9 years. When we started dating, she told me that they had split up months beforehand, and that they were in a pseudo open relationship/fwb type deal. He told me they weren't together at all in any way. According to her, they weren't together, they weren't partners, but they had been together for so long that they were comfortable with each other enough to fuck when they needed it, but they hadn't fucked for a long time and they \"didn't really talk to each other\" at that point. She told me that he knew we were dating, and that he was not happy about it at all. She also told me I was the only one she was seeing. That was a lie. About a year into the relationship, I learned that not only were they still talking, but they had been talking that entire time she said they weren't, and they were still telling each other they loved each other up until *the same fucking day we started dating*. DARVO took hold immediately, and I was the bad person for snooping and reading her messages on her laptop. Conveniently ignoring that she had told me that I could use her laptop any time I needed to. Six months after this, she asked me to look in her email for a receipt for some software she bought, and front and fucking center was an email thread with someone that she had been talking to a few weeks before we started dating. She sent nudes to this guy, and lied to me about it. She told me she wasn't talking to anyone but me, but she was still with her ex, and sexting some guy in the Middle East. \n\nWe fought about this for the rest of our relationship, and the entirety of our marriage. We fought about this for almost 8 years straight. She never understood why I was so hurt, and I was consistently the bad guy for not being able to just get over it. She knew that I got cheated on, it was one of the first things I told her about, and she still fucking lied to me. From the get go. Frankly, a big part of me hopes that she still looks at my reddit profile so she can be reminded of what a piece of shit she is.\n\nWe went to couples therapy, we went for almost 2 years. I got to hear all about how little I did around the house, how little I respected her, how much of an emotional burden she lived with because of how she was treated, and how life was so unfair to her. She waxed poetic about how paranoid I was, how heavy a toll it was that I questioned her inconsistently hiding notifications, how controlling I was when I told her I was suspicious of what happened at a party she went to where the whole time she managed to be able to talk to all of her friends but not me while being on psychedelics around a group full of swingers and non-monogamists. It was all just so unfair to poor her. But me? My pain? My struggles? Peanuts to her. She never understood why I didn't trust her with anyone ever. It was my fault that I was hurting, because I was making the choice not to trust her, and there was no reason not to trust her. Couples therapy ended when our therapist said we both needed individual and couples therapy, and that they could stay on as one of our therapists, or our couples therapist, but not both, and we needed both. I kept them as my therapist. Finding a new couples therapist was her responsibility, and we never went back for the rest of our time together.\n\nIt took another year and a half of intensive therapy, but I told her I wanted out. I told her twice, actually, but the first time she managed to talk me out of it. But not the second time. As we went through the divorce, and I told our friends what all had happened, one by one they stopped talking to her, and she never understood why. My lawyer said she was the most entitled ex-spouse she's ever had to deal with. Her own fucking lawyer got me a better deal in our divorce. That is how fucked of a person she is. Even her own goddamned lawyer could tell that. Thanks to her, I learned that I needed to be suspicious of not just friends, but exs, coworkers, strangers. Everybody was untrustworthy. I learned that I needed to look over my shoulder no matter what, because I was going to get hurt eventually.\n\nIt took a few years after that, but earlier this year I found someone that I honestly thought was safe. We met on a dating app. We had similar mental health diagnoses. We had similar relationship experiences. We were both just so sick and tired of being lied to and cheated on. I thought \"this is it, *finally* someone actually understands, not just romantically but personally, and it's someone I can be truly vulnerable with!\" Alas, it was not. At first, there was an ex that they still were close to, because it wasn't just their ex, it was somebody who had been in their life for 20 years at this point and was someone they were friends with for their entire adult life. But they were definitely not together in any way! They just played games together, and were interested in the same things, and talked all day every day on four different apps. Oh wait, they still loved them, oops. Also they still collaborated on roleplays together. And sometimes they'd be erotic. And the last time was a few months ago. And they send porn to each other. But they weren't together! They just loved each other very, very, very, very much. And I just needed to understand that it wasn't \"porn\" to them it was strictly art, and it wasn't \"erotic\" roleplay it just sometimes went that route as they collaborated. Oh and then, even though they were 38 years old, there was a between-18-and-21-they-dont-really-know year old kid they just played games with. And sent porn to. And told that they were so happy they had each other in their lives. But they were too young for them, even though they previously e-dated a *definitely-not-the-same-kid* 18 year old they met online. But I was the bad guy when I told them I felt lied to and misled. Thanks to them, I learned that I needed to look over my shoulder for absolutely everybody regardless of context, even children...\n\nWhen does it end? When will people just, stop lying? I am so, *so* tired of meeting people and they're just straight up not who they say they are. They fucking lie. They cheat. They deceive. And it somehow, someway, is always my fault when I find out.\n\nI can work with frankly just about anything if you're honest. But I can't work with liars, and I can't keep working with liars because it pains me in my soul to do so.\n\nWhen you do finally find someone who doesn't lie, doesn't cheat, doesn't deceive, how do you stop compulsively looking over your shoulder while you wait for the other shoe to drop?",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI never thought I’d be here, but I need to let this out. I’ve been married for over 30 years. My wife and I started dating as teenagers, built a life together, raised a son, and survived more storms than I can count. I’ve also survived stage 4 colon cancer — an 8% chance of survival, and somehow I made it.\n\nTwo years ago, my wife confessed to multiple affairs (2017–2018 and 2021–2022, both with the same man). She kept it from me for years, and when it finally came out, it destroyed me. I still love her more than anything, but the betrayal crushed something inside me.\n\nWhat makes it harder is this: since her confession, she’s been angry and guarded over me — almost like I was the one who cheated. Every time I try to talk about my pain or my needs, she gets mad and shuts me down. It leaves me feeling like I’m being punished for her choices.\n\nThe truth is, sex and freedom are all I think about these days. Cancer took a lot from me, and so did the betrayal. Part of me feels like if I had a sexual experience outside this marriage, it might help me heal or at least feel alive again. But I’m torn, because I don’t want to destroy what’s left of us.\n\nI’m exhausted from carrying this. I love her with everything I have, but I also feel broken, silenced, and desperate.\n\nHas anyone else been in this place — where you still love your spouse, but their betrayal and their reaction afterward make you feel trapped in someone else’s cage? How did you survive it? Did anything ever make the pain less crushing?\n\nAny insight or encouragement would mean a lot.\n\n— David\n",

And about 3 1/2 months since we both officially moved to different places. \n\nI don’t miss our relationship, I don’t miss him, I certainly no longer hold romantic feelings toward him. I feel like because of this, I should be considered as having “moved on”. \n\nBut, I am still so deeply affected and hurt by what he did. How long should it take to move on from that? \n\nI see posts in here and consider myself to be in a more fortunate position than most here find themselves to be. An engagement was coming but we were not married, we were together a few years, and we kept our finances separate (I wouldn’t combine any without being married first). It was more or less a clean break. \n\nBut still, I randomly burst into tears or have horribly low days because of it all. It doesn’t help that this is the second long-term domestic partnership I’ve had that ended this way, and I never took the time to heal from that one before jumping into the last.\n\nHow long did you cry over the pain even after romantic feelings were gone after leaving?",

One minute she will call me a toxic and emotionally abusive husband and the next she will be sending me sexy photos and inviting me over. She is constantly trying to get me back and its honestly emotionally and mentally draining. I did download a parenting app today and will be blocking her soon. \n\nMon and Tue were my day with the kids she withheld them from me sees i have a drinking problem. a drink or two on nights i dont have the kids. she also kicked my door in to my house Sunday. But still wants me to take her back. \n\nIm also still mourning what has been lost with my family unit. The divorce process seems very hurtful atleast it has so far. The STBXW told me that I would hate her through this process. Veiled threat if i didnt take her back? Why dont these betrayers just let us move on and make it fair for the kids and leave us alone. Why the need to try and destroy to seek what control they still think they have. ",

      "selftext": "Edit: Thanks for all the feedback. I cant blame the ones that think this is fake, I would too. Im probably being an idiot and causing myself unneeded pain, but the person that did this was not my wife. Right now I think im going to try and make it work, but that might change tomorrow. I have always been the type of person that had to touch the stove.\n\nI just wrote another post about a song I wrote not intending to share my story, but screw it. This one needs to be shared. Buckle up for this roller coaster. You cant make this stuff up.\n\nLet me start by saying me and my wife's relationship (imo) has been going great. We have 3 kids (21, 19, 16). She just hit 40 and her hormones are raging. It is the first time in our marriage that her drive is greater than mine and it has been a very eye opening experience. A couple things about me real quick for context that is important later. My wife hates porn and has caught me several times looking at it over our relationship. Also, I am bad at showing affection.\n\nNow, moving on. About 4-5 days ago I realized my wife was acting strange specifically always on her phone and swiping away when I try and look. We were sitting on the couch at night and a thought came to me... I put my head in her lap and pretended to sleep. Within a few minutes she pulls up a messenger. I cant make it out, but she sends a message. I am thinking it could be a friend, so I didnt want to over react. The next thing she does is deletes the conversation. I pop up and the questions, denials, and gas lighting start. Basically, she says it is nothing and we go to bed mad. \n\nMove forward to 4 am and I wake up and look at her phone. There are 2 messages saying something like \"i love you so much, are you ok?\" They came in at 2 am so she didnt have a chance to delete. I wake her up to confront her. This is where the trickle truthing starts. \n\nFirst, the guy was someone we both met at a near by bar we frequent. I play pool with him. He is 26, no job, been to jail, and I am pretty sure an alcoholic. She admits that about 3 weeks prior they had danced (i was there a saw it) and she felt something. That is when they started messaging on Facebook. In those 3 weeks she fell madly in love. She told me she was so in love she could never stop and in so many words wasn't and was going to leave. \n\nI was so calm it shocked me. I preceded to (in my mind) convince her this was so dumb on her part. She half heartedly agreed and said she would stay. I proceeded for the remainder of the day to basically just cry and drink. She was with me basically showing no emotion. \"How could you make someone you love hurt like this\" type stuff. I had no idea what to do, but it hurt. \n\nThe next day I went to work and had an epiphany. My sadness and anger was only making me hurt more. I decided I was going to do what made me happy and one of those things was saving my wife from herself. Not because she deserved it, but because that would make me feel better. \n\nAfter work I showed up with flowers and told her we were going on a date. I did all the things I should have always been doing. I wanted to make it easy to stay. She was laughing, happy, but ultimately still conflicted. She was still defensive of her phone and refused to block the guy. \n\nThe next morning I headed to work but forgot something at home. When I went in I didnt see her. I found her in the closet messaging him. At first she said I needed to trust her that she wasn't blah blah. Then it was, she is ending it. Finally, I got her to show me and they were talking about how long a divorce would take. She swore though the next message was going to be her ending it, but she was trying to figure out how. \n\nI was DONE. For the first time she showed emotion. Begging, pleading, all of it. I left and started planning the divorce. One of the things I did was call her best friend and asked her to save her. That I was pretty sure I was leaving, but she could do so much better than some no job loser that hangs out at bars. Her friend was shocked, didnt want to be in the middle, but said she would talk to her. \n\nLater, once I knew her friend had talked to her, I called her. She answered and seemed off. She didnt want to talk because she was \"about to go into the store.\" I hung up mad and as soon as I did i realized she was with him. I was distraught, messaging and calling frantically. No response. \n\nFinally, an hour later she called back. She was balling. I began to comfort my wife over her being heartbroken about breaking up with her 26 year old, jobless boyfriend with a record. I was so mad and relieved at the same time. I wanted to say so much, but most of it I would regret so I didnt. \n\nThat night he was blocked, and I had access to all of her accounts. You know what I felt from her? Anger. Im not sure she was, but that is what it felt like. Now we are up to yesterday. The best day for me since it happened. I was able to finally sleep. \n\nWe went out after work and had a great time. Me being me I made jokes about the situation and had her rolling. It was like she was coming off of drug withdrawal, and was finally her again. We talked and talked. She gave me more info that shocked me and believe it or not made me laugh. \n\nI found out this guy is weeks away from starting a 2 year stint for.... CP. My immediate question is what the heck were you going to do while he was away? The plan was for his dad to move in with her and take care of her... It was so ridiculous that it made me feel better. \n\nI clearly saved her from some kind of episode. Now today, I feel horrible again. I am back in my head and feel like I need to find out what else she isn't telling me. I cant even focus on work, so I am writing this. There are several details I have left out and so many emotions and internal thoughts I could write a book. For now I will stop here. I think we will be ok. I am focused on not letting this change me because if I let that happen I know forgiveness is unattainable.\n\nTLDR: My wife of 22 years that hates porn was going to leave me, her kids and her friends for a 26 year old guy with no job and a record that was about to go to prison for CP and live with his dad until he got out then hopefully start a family with a guy on the sex offender registry.",

      "title": "Just realized I’m a badass. 7 months after leaving.",
      "selftext": "I served papers in February. Almost 7 months ago to date. \nI moved states with my kids, started a new full time job and started healing from the 10 years of narcissistic behavior I was shown.\n\nI’m from Europe, all my safety network is still there and my only reason living here was because of my STBX. I have two little kids now that keep me here and honestly, not an issue. I do feel lonely in the daily chaos and decisions that need to be made, but it beats what I went through to be with someone.\n\nSo what I realized as I looked back on the past years and months. I found out about the cheating the first go around in 2022. I was hit very very hard by it. I worked so darn hard to stay and fight for our family, I grew stronger and matured in ways I never thought possible. It was the hardest year of my life trying to get through the shock and anxiety attacks.\n\nI saw red flags and inappropriate exchanges for years after and always promised myself I’d get smarter, not just stronger, and not confront him. But each time I thought honesty must be somewhere in his system and he’d come clean or at least explain himself. Never happened. BUT this January, something deep in me clicked. I saw an exchange, got smart, played it cool, saddled up a lawyer, got a PI and went to work for weeks. Getting shocking things from my team as I played it cool and envisioned my freedom.\n\nOnce I had enough to be able to get what I wanted - the kids and moving as far away from that twisted triangle he made me unknowingly a part of - I served both him and AP and watched it crumble as I was finally allowed to breathe.\n\nI then packed up what personal things I wanted, drove 19 hours to our new home, got an apartment, started my new role, was promoted in my new role, got my kid into a new pre-k and then kindergarten. Found a daycare. Handle pick ups and drop offs and after school and sicknesses and decisions for the future and at no point have I regretted it. \n\nShould I have left earlier? Probably, but I probably wouldn’t have felt as disconnected and easily over it because I would’ve still wondered if I personally did enough. I now have no such thoughts and enjoy the hardness of being a single parent with gratitude I never truly have felt before on such level. \n\nI’m flourishing and my kids see it, they flourish with me as we go through this new start and get further away from it all. I still have to wait 5 months to file the divorce (old state rules) but I have more than enough after leaving to show everything I need to make sure the new-found peace isn’t disturbed by my STBX.\n\nThis is all to say to not sell yourselves short. If you left - you did a very hard thing and are a total superstar for it. If you stayed - if that’s what you need to be able to move forward- do that. But please look in the mirror and acknowledge your worth and say thanks to yourself! ",

He also told me he has had a spark with another woman a while ago, but refuses to pursue it because he still wants to work on us. After lying to me about where he was one weekend, I checked his phone (I know. Not proud of it.) and found that he met up with this woman and has been flirting with her constantly, this woman is his colleague he sees in the office 3x a week.\n\nI was beyond heartbroken, and confronted him. He was seriously not happy that I went through his phone - but we both had a serious talk where he assured me nothing physical has happened and he did mean that he wants to work on us, and has spoken with her to end the talking outside of work. We both agreed to try - me with the intimacy, and him with the lies and trust.\n\nHe was showing me something on his phone yesterday and a WhatsApp message popped up at the top that said “1 new message”. Now if you use WhatsApp you know this is unusual, the message preview always has the name of the person and part of the message. I immediately got alarm bells and when he was in the shower I checked his phone (he changed his password surprise surprise but I managed to guess it first try) and I saw her chat is in a Locked chat on WhatsApp and he is still flirting with her.\n\nI love him so much and was willing to work on this marriage with the condition this situation ends, which he was so on board for.

So I wrote this:\n\nI wake in sweat,\nthough the room is cold.\nHer breath beside me, soft as forgiveness,\nbut I’m drowning in a dream\nwhere your name\nis still in her mouth.\n\nThe bed is ours again.\nThe sheets are clean.\nBut I remember the scent\nthat wasn’t mine.\n\nShe laughs in the kitchen,\nsunlight catching in her hair—\nand I want to believe\nthis is enough.\nThat the war is over.\nThat the peace is real.\nBut I flinch when the phone rings\nand it’s a number I don’t recognize.\n\nThere are places I don’t go now.\nBars with cracked leather booths.\nThe lake house.\nThat diner with the jukebox\nthat played our song\nthe night I saw them\nin the rearview mirror\nbefore I knew what I was seeing.\n\nI’ve forgiven her.\nI say it like a prayer.\nI say it like a spell.\nI say it until my throat bleeds\nand the mirror still shows\na man who doesn’t trust\nhis own reflection.\n\nShe holds me like she means it.\nShe cries when I cry.\nShe’s rebuilt the house\nwith her bare hands,\nand I live in it.\nBut some nights\nI sleep in the ruins.\n\nFlashbacks hit like car crashes—\na laugh too familiar,\na movie line that cuts like glass,\na scent, a song,\na silence too long.\n\nI want to be whole.\nI want to be now.\nBut the past is a shadow\nwith teeth.\n\nI love her.\nGod, I love her.\nAnd I hate that I still bleed\nwhen I remember\nhow she broke me\nwith someone who once\ncalled me brother.\n\nWe are happy.\nWe are healed.\nWe are haunted.\n\nAnd I smile through it all,\nbecause love is a choice\nI make every day—\neven when the ghosts\nwon’t let me sleep.\n",

      "selftext": "This was just very recent. I (30m) was away for two months when my wife (27f) and I got into an argument during a video call. We were both exhausted from our days and after 20 mins of listening to her rants, my face grew visibly weary and that's where she snapped. She started bawling and after a minute dropped the call. She blocked me for the rest of the trip. She had an existing severe bipolar diagnosis 4 months prior so I empathized and just understood what she could have been going through. \n\nWhile I was away, I had noticed in the security cams in the garage that she would be gone, sometimes for a whole day, wearing nice clothes. I had also seen her filling up her car with packed bags so I assumed she was leaving. I felt helpless not being able to do anything to stop her or contact her.   \n  \nFast forward to me getting home. When I arrived, she was not at home. Her gadgets where still laying around but she wasn't anywhere to be seen. My strongest gut feeling at the time: check her messages. I checked her phone. Different password. Her tablet. Different password. Her laptop... the same. \n\nI saw messages from 4 guys talking about how they felt about each other. How warm they felt that night. How they still feel each other nibbles. How one of them grinds his teeth in his sleep. How they were planning their next meet up. It was horrible. I really expected to bawl but surprisingly, I remained relatively cool.\n\nI faced my wife a couple of minutes later when she came back. Apparently she was across the street at my parents' house telling them that she's leaving. I confronted her about the messages and she said she just made out and touched with them. I didn't push too much for details. She also apparently downloaded a dating app when she thought I did as well. (long story on that. Basically I didn't, and I explained it clearly) We talked til the sun rose mentioning fixing ourselves, counseling, etc. Her main issue with me apparently was watching porn and that's where a lot of her insecurity stems from, according to her. (I've been clean ever since I got back home in hopes to prove to her I'm worth it.) Before she left, I asked her if she'll still be talking to them still and she said \"trust me.\" I clung to those words of hope.\n\nFast forward again to yesterday. We've been talking every now and then about our issues. 30 minutes after a pretty decent conversation, I asked her to be honest if she had sex with any of them. She said yes. With one of them two weeks after I had landed. Two weeks after she said \"trust me.\" She felt validated and said she, as a woman, still has needs. I snapped. After years of taking care of her, staying loyal even in moments of temptations, giving my all for her, all of that whilst being trampled and being made to feel useless, I drew the line. I said \"I'm done. I'm good.\" Her demeanor completely changed and she started back pedaling asking what I meant. This was the most begging I've seen from her in our 6 years. I couldn't really get my mind straight but I was 95% out the door. \n\nWe'll talk again later today. She sent a long message saying how she's hurt me and how sorry she was. Although she also included in the message that she couldn't wait for us to reconcile and not live her life. I've gone through hundreds of threads about bipolar spouses and SOs who, in their manic phase, experience hypersexuality and have sex with multiple people. I also came to a realization that she'd most likely slept with those original 4 guys. Reviewing the messages I took a picture off; it was just too obvious. These are textbook symptoms of a person with severe BPD. Especially one drowning in alcohol and weed. She's a liar and a cheat. Funny cause she sees my porn as cheating. I'll also recall her texting one of those 4 guys to meet her at her new place. All while we were talking and clearing things up that inital night I found out. \n\nPeople say anyone I love is lucky. I loved her with all my entire being. All my actions in life were always connected in some way to her. Looking back, it might have been some sort of Stockholm syndrome. Receiving the verbal undressing and looking forward to her happy moments. \n\nWish me luck in staying true to myself by leaving her once and for all. ",

He always told me I was the love of his life, that we’d get married and build a family together. But the proposal always got “delayed” for reasons tied to his career, even though he was already successful.\n\nDuring those years, every decision I made was for the family I thought we were building. I left a job I loved because he said it was not “family oriented.” I poured myself into two projects we started together and ended up running them alone, splitting the profits 50/50. I turned our apartment into a home and cared for his daughter from his first marriage as if she were my own.\n\nA few months ago, he went on a trip with friends and accidentally sent me a video of the scenery — with a woman’s voice in the background. When I asked him about it, he ignored me for more than 24 hours. Desperate (and I know it wasn’t right), I checked his computer at home. What I found destroyed me: not just one, but multiple affairs. Conversations, videos… years of betrayal.\n\nNow I feel like every choice I made over the past 6 years was for a future that never existed. I can’t even find the strength to get out of bed.\n\nFor those who have been through something similar: how do you even begin to rebuild when your trust and your vision of the future feel completely shattered? Any advice would mean so much right now.\n\nThank you for reading.",

      "selftext": "I have previously posted seeking advice on the relationship itself, now I’m trying to understand my parents response.\n\nAside from communication issues and standard conflicts that I believe all couples go through, the main issue in the relationship was my partner’s tumultuous relationship with alcohol. Even into his late 20s and early 30s he can’t control when to stop and uses that and coke regularly to ‘medicate’ and ‘let loose’. When he’s on a bender he changes as a person and it takes him days to recover. As his partner I’ve never liked seeing him become someone I don’t know/like much and then deal with his moods and the aftermath week after week - and I’ve always felt like the second choice, wanting him to want to come home to me. It caused him to fracture his neck and skull in a serious accident caused by inebriation around 18 months ago, and has since also led to a string of infidelities and betrayals.\n\n1.\t⁠caught him texting prostitutes in November, multiple messages to multiple workers but no obvious signs that he acted on it, plus he was passed out drunk when I got home - admitted it when he realised I really had seen them all but insisted he didn’t and never would “properly cheat”\n2.\t⁠spent HUNDREDS in a strip club during a stag do in private dances and his shifty behaviour/avoidance prompted me to do some snooping. I believe that I have solid evidence he slept with a prostitute: he’d already been alone and had refused to go home with friends since 2am. £200 cash withdrawal at 4:39AM - taxi to a hotel the other side of town at 4:50 - taxi back to his actual accommodation just after 6am - spent £140 on private STI tests from Superdrug doctor the day after he got home, delivered to the flat on a day I was away at a wedding.\n3.\t⁠continuously denied all of the above and given other explanations which don’t make sense when I’ve confronted him\n4.\t⁠other seedy behaviour - deleted chats/messages/call logs after I’ve seen or heard breadcrumbs of suspicious activity\n5.\t⁠after his “sobriety” started he lasted 10 days, I spent one night away and he goes on a Wednesday night bender out til 4am, lies to me about how much he drank and what time he came home, I saw messages from his friends asking him where he’d gone and whether he’d actually gone home because “I did wonder 😉”\n6.\t⁠until last Wednesday (above incident) I’d been TRYING to work through on the basis that he admits to everything, goes sober and gets therapy - right now he still hasn’t admitted everything, at this point I’ve not even told him everything I actually know and he’s still denying/explaining away most of the things I do confront him with. He bartered the delay of his sobriety to the end of summer and has already broken it twice in two weeks, and only booked therapy in response to me trying to initiate a breakup last week after I realised he wasn’t ready to change. Because he broke down and showed me that one action of willingness to try, I didn’t have the strength to follow through. Then..\n7.\t⁠at the weekend we attended a party together, he starts drinking - shock, I went back alone after it finished to start getting ready for bed, I was naked and he came in and told me a group of people were coming back for afters, I said no, he insisted and told me to hide myself in the bedroom, the doorbell goes, I refused and sat down naked in the hallway telling him that I didn’t agree to this, were in a terrible place in the relationship and he needs to call them to say they aren’t coming in - he gives me a dark look and buzzes them into the hallway (block of flats) and opens our front door - so I have to run into a room to hide myself. There have been other instances of subtle manipulation, control and pure mean-ness on his part when he’s drunk.\n\nThe following day I drove to my parents house and completely broke down on arrival - my mum has known most of everything that’s happened throughout and whilst listening and offering me advice, her advice has generally been to give him the benefit of the doubt and not try to force him into anything - my dad didn’t know much. They were very supportive on the day and told me to stay with them for as long as I needed and that I’ve tried so hard but I can’t keep living in that situation if he won’t help himself. My mum has since said that she knows that I want to run away from the relationship and that she gets why but that I need to wait until the dust has settled, and that we are both in better mental headspaces before I actually make that decision or she knows I’ll regret it. I haven’t spoken to my dad properly about it - he’s in a bad headspace and doesn’t have much emotional capacity and has always been pretty emotionally distant/unavailable. It almost seems like they think I should stay in this relationship? Shouldn’t parents want to protect their children? Am I overreacting in thinking that this relationship is past saving if this all still hasn’t been enough of a wake up call for him to truly want to face his issues?\n\nOriginal post if anyone wants to read: https://www.reddit.com/r/survivinginfidelity/s/BWDV4NKGdH",

      "selftext": "My husband of 5 years is in rehab for the first time after a 20 year alcohol addition. We have two very young children. The day before I visited him this week he told me he was writing me a letter but that it wasn’t ready yet. Part of me knew this might be part of his program, but all of me knew he was gearing up to tell me something major in the letter. While I was there, I could tell something was off so I pressed him and he admitted that he had a drunken one night stand 3 years ago on a vacation while I was asleep. He says he didn’t tell me because I always said I would divorce him if he cheated, which I did say but is still bullshit. We were also expecting our first child at the time via surrogate. I’ve done some digging and believe that this was his only indiscretion and he swears up and down that it was. I’m inclined to believe him on that front. I told him that I was consulting with a divorce attorney, and he freaked out and told his mom the situation and she told his entire side of the family that we are close to. I am perhaps more upset he aired our private marital issues without my permission, and the not telling me about the indiscretion for 3 years, than I am about the actual cheating. I’ve never known him to lie other than about his drinking.\n\nOur couples therapist has advised me that since he is in rehab that as hard as it is, I need to table further discussions with him about this while he is there and allow him to focus on the program so that he can be sober for our children. He does seem remorseful. I do love him and want to work toward forgiving him, but the circumstances make this so incredibly difficult for me. I do think I will require that he spend some time living outside of the house when he comes out of rehab while we work on rebuilding trust. Any words of support or advice is appreciated. ",

(If something sounds weird I apologize, I'm not a native English speaker :( )\n\nI've found my 27F (I'm 27M, no kids) partner cheated on me just yesterday for around 1 ½ months, after 7 ½ years of being in our relationship and one year since we get engaged. Until yesterday, I had a complete confidence about her and it just shattered in a couple of minutes. \n\nI'm with the wound still bleeding, I know that, but she has been spamming me in every time she had the opportunity to tell me she wanna fix the things. Maybe we were not married yet, but our 7 ½ years were something. Some friends have told me that I need to let her do the work of reconciliation and I agree with them, perhaps only help with a good disposition to recover the lost confidence and don't lose the main point of all and still have not clear: If I wanna do it or not. \n\nFor example, I've proposed her to take individual therapy sessions and after a time that we would work in ourselves, try to take some couple therapy sessions. But I'm still thinking I'm doing the biggest part of the job, and I'm thinking too maybe she in her mind is realizing I'm a foolish and manipulable person. I know it may be truth and are also the 0% confidence that I have right now. \n\nCheating is cheating, and it's a choice, not a mistake. But I wanna choose to believe, that's the reason that I'm here trying to get all the advices I can. I have been with her in the worst moments (her mom passed away 4Y ago and her dad just the last Christmas). And something inside me wants to believe that she is telling me is real. Maybe I have to wait a couple months until we can work in our emotions and reasons before believe in what she is telling me? Or I'm a stupid person?\n\nSorry for the bible, thanks if you reached this point. ",

I went to a couples therapy session last week at her request and the therapist said she could see that I was in a great deal of emotional pain.  She also mentioned that her research shows that couples that separate have a low success rate of reconciliation.  Then she asked how I felt about the chances of reconciliation on a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being completely positive.  I said I was at a 3.  After the session the WW asked what I thought of that statistic.  I said that I don't care about her statistics.  That's not me and what I need.  She seemed sad the rest of the evening.  \n\nThis past weekend we went to an event that we had previously planned to attend together and it required a considerable amount of time in the car.  On the ride home she was relentless.  She said she doesn't do patient.  She thinks my getting an apartment is stupid and it's a waste.  I just let her rant on.  So much was said.  I ended up yelling.  It wasn't my best moment but she just kept at it.  Telling me that I am just running away.  She told me to just tell the kids and get it over with....\n\nYesterday she called me at work and offered a suggestion that we table my apartment for one year and work on things.  \"If we're going to be in limbo, we should be in limbo together and work on things\" She said.    \n\nYou know......I almost started to consider this.   I swear....I have Stockholm syndrome....\n\nLast night in bed she said \"you know another bad thing is, people are going to talk.  people who normally wouldn't say anything will say something negative and that is really hard to un-hear if we want to fix things\".  Ok....  She said \"I am sorry but I just can't be patient.  I am frustrated with all of this and am just about ready to tell you to make a decision to work on things or just end the marriage.....I don't do limbo.  This limbo doesn't work for me.\"  I said \"Ok....it was ok for you to drag me through shit for 9 months and keep me in limbo.  But it's not ok for you to be in limbo?\"  At this point it was after midnight which is when she really likes to get into things and I have to be at work at 7am.  I had to leave, I got up and threw my shoes on and took a walk.  She tried to join me and then she said \" Honey, I just love you \"...and I stopped her and said this is WALK time, not TALK time and walked away.  My god......wtf....  \n\nI need my apartment just so I can get some damn sleep.  I know she regrets her actions but this isn't how a remorseful person acts is it????\n\nI know I need to get out of this.  This is not healthy for me.  This sucks.  I love this woman...but.... I swear this is emotional abuse.  \n\nI just don't know if I should keep it simple and say that \"I am choosing me and this is not right for me anymore\" or should I tell her that I found evidence of the lies in her apology tour in the phone bills.  Either way, I have a suitcase packed in case I need to make a quick exit to go to a hotel.",

My husband had a major porn/video sex addiction and was chasing women online while I was pregnant with our second daughter. He had multiple email address, Skype and chat accounts he was using to meet women and then either charm or pay them for video sex. He said it was 100s of women. Meanwhile I was pregnant and caring for a 2 year old, being loyal as can be, completely in love and trusting of this man I thought would never betray me. He was spending hours chasing them while I was caring for our daughter, making him lunches, taking care of the animals and giving him \"downtime\" to decompress before and after work. Somehow we made it through the initial discovery, then he relapsed over a year later when I was in the hospital. I was there by myself and my husband never even came to visit me after a life threatening accident because it was too hard for him to deal with. Instead he numbed out to women online for 3 days straight while I was alone (thank God my elderly mom made the drive to be by my side when she could). I forgave him for that and then he had a small relapse last November. Couldn't help but use a loophole he found on Youtube to chase women, lied to me when I said I felt something was off and then finally came clean a few weeks later. That was it.\n\nFrom that point forward I lost all respect for him and with respect, I lost all attraction for him. On a cerebral level I can look at him, know he is handsome, see the counseling and hard work he has done. Maybe he's a different man now, maybe he isn't, but I don't think I'll ever trust him fully again. He'll probably go on to have a beautiful relationship and life with someone else and I'm stuck with MAJOR trust issues. I've been struggling with the decision to upend our life, lose the ranch and animals and everything we've worked so hard for, break up our young family or stay in a marriage where I don't feel love. I've gone back and forth since November and finally realized I'm done. The feelings are gone and no amount of therapy on his or my end is going to change that. I've tried. I'm sad, I've cried a lot, I have no clue what the future will look like and I'm scared. I don't want to lose everything we've worked for. I live my dream life, but my husband ruined it and I've lost the energy to keep pretending everything is OK.",

I can’t stop myself from ruminating, and my mind keeps going back to how that girl I proposed to could do this to me. How is it even possible? Is it even real? \n\nCan someone please help me here? I’m talking to a therapist, and that is helping, but I really need to hear some advice from this community. How do you think I should deal with this?",

      "selftext": "I F/25 had found out that my husband M/26 had an EA with a woman in his basic training, and she has no remorse for it.\n\nI had found out two months ago and saw suspiciously unfinished text messages between her and him. Im currently trying to work things out with him. It started the last two weeks before his graduation (May  22) and lasted until I found out July 16. He had not given any indication he was speaking to her, or gave any sign that he was cheating. I had uprooted my life for him from California all the way to South Carolina. \n\nHow I found out; I had a gnawing feeling in my body and went through his phone when he was sleeping. There was text messages between her and him that it seemed like he deleted certain things in there, so the chain of texts didn’t make sense. I had woken him up, did some reverse psychology and told him I “knew” what he deleted (even though I didn’t) and after ten minutes of him denying, he told me everything. I wish I was wrong at that moment. Trust destroyed. \n\nThe other woman knew about me, as he told her about me. She still pursued it, and he entertained it. Went to confront her via social media, she blocked me and him. She proceeds to get people in their division from basic to harass me in my social media, flooding with DMs about how I’m gonna get my ass beat and that IM?? The homewrecker?? Okay. She even proceeds to get married a month after all of this to someone she just met at her A-School, and posts that she’s not a homewrecker because she “can” do it, but because she’s “hot”.\n\nI told his chain of command, and unfortunately they opened an investigation on my husband and the woman. Unfortunately the side that still loves him despite the anger and self hatred I feel, the confusion even—I chose to forgive him. He HAS been remorseful, I can see it with his actions as he’s been trying to do whatever he can to fix what he created, and he’s even admitted one time drunk that he knows I’ll never look at him the same, or trust him the same—but he’d rather lose everything and be kicked out of the military than to lose me. Of course I don’t want that. I don’t wish bad on anyone, even if I’m the targeted person.\n\nI leave for basic training myself in less than two months. I guess what I’m trying to figure out is how do I move past this? I love him, so much that I can’t even fathom to think about even looking at someone else the way I did with him. I can’t even think of revenge, but man do I hate sometimes looking at him because it hurts. I hate myself more because I’m questioning why wasn’t I enough—Now I leave soon, and I feel like there’s not enough time to fix what was broken between us.\n\nFriend in Ranger in the Army says that I wasn’t the issue, it was the vulnerability my husband felt. She was just AVAILABLE when I wasnt. But that doesn’t excuse what he did. So many people tell me I deserve better, but I just don’t want my marriage to end. I still love him and want to fix this with him—but I feel so hurt and angry. Lost. ",

For the past year I’ve focused on being kind, supportive, and keeping things stable for the sake of our daughter.",
      "selftext": "And I mean really supportive. I’ve answered his drunk, crying calls at night with patience and empathy. I supported him when AP dumped him after the affair blew up, I went with him to a funeral, I listened when he told me he still loved me and gently set boundaries, I’ve been friendly and lighthearted in our co-parenting chats. Basically I’ve shown him grace over and over, even when it was exhausting, because I wanted him stable for our daughter.\n\nSo here’s what happened: I saw the AP in real life for the first time. It shook me a bit, stirred up old trauma… but I was dealing with it. A few days later I was talking to him about our daughter and casually mentioned it. All I said was:\n\t“I have now seen [her name] in real life.”\n        “Don’t worry, nothing happened 🙂.”\n\nThat was it. I didn’t ask for comfort, I didn’t dwell on it. He’s even asked me a few times before if I’d seen her yet as she lives nearby so it felt natural to just mention it.\n\nA few days later he himself brings her up with a funny story about bumping into her, and then suddenly turns on me:\n\t“Why did you tell me you saw her?!” (angry tone)\n\t“Your feelings are not my responsibility.”\n\t•\t“What do you even expect me to say to that?”\n\tWhen I answered, “Honestly, just ‘sorry, that must’ve been hard’ would be nice,” he snapped back: “I’m not saying sorry for that. I’ve already said sorry, I don’t need to say it again. It was inappropriate of you to even bring it up. You broke your boundaries by doing that. \n\tHe added: “The emotional fallout of you seeing her is not my responsibility to deal with.”\n\nI was stunned. I never said it was his “responsibility” I wasn’t expecting deep emotional labor, just the bare minimum of human empathy. And the hypocrisy of it kills me. I’ve comforted him through heartbreak, family deaths, late-night breakdowns, even about the very woman he cheated with. I’ve listened with kindness while he leaned on me. But when I simply mention seeing her and reassure him nothing happened? I get hostility and lectures about “boundaries.” And made to feel like the bad guy. \n\nIt made my head spin. I thought the kindness I’d been giving was being met with at least some genuine remorse and respect. But this felt like D-Day all over again the same coldness and lack of empathy he showed when he first smirked while telling me he was leaving. I honestly thought he regretted that cruelty and wanted to rebuild a decent co-parenting relationship. Now I’m wondering if he was ever sorry at all, or just sorry for himself.\n\nLesson learned: don’t expect kindness back from someone who’s proven they can be cruel. I regret giving him so much of my compassion when he’s so quick to deny me even the smallest bit in return. I also feel really stupid and like I really messed up by mentioning it in the first place and feel some guilt about accidentally violating a boundary which I didn’t know was there. \n\nI have now moved the conversations over to a parenting app, told him I’m happy to stop all the friendliness since it only goes one way. \nI’m really disappointed that my efforts and kindness over the last year have been chucked back in my face, feel unsure if I deserved it by crossing a line by bringing it up, or brought it on myself. I’m disappointed we couldn’t just treat each other with mutual kindness and have the kind of dynamic we promised each other and both thought was best for our daughter. Right now the trauma of the betrayal feels very refreshed as he’s acted suddenly as cold and cruel as he did on D Day all over again. Feeling very raw and confused right now. \n",

      "selftext": "Back story.. \n15 years ago I was cheated on by my ex. Had no idea until I found the evidence.then after that I felt an awful gut feeling, panicky, anxiety etc. Checked his phone again and there it was.we broke up. Life moved on. \n\nI am one of these people where I can tell when something or someone is off. And usually I get it right. I've had lots of told you so moments. \n\nBack to the present...\n\nI've been with My partner for 13 years, at the beginning I was insecure due to the previous relationship, but this man a long with a lot of self and personal growth shaped me into the most confident version of myself. Now a woman of 33 I feel like a healed version of myself. I have not had a bad feeling regarding this man in a very very long time. We are in a great place with our relationship, he sends me cute quotes and stuff all the time about how much he loves me. \n\nHowever...last week the intuition hit me like a brick wall from no where!!!\n\nOn wednesday I felt that awful panicked feeling and couldn't put my finger on it, felt like I was going crazy. He came home from work and told me he was going for drinks in another town at the weekend..of course that's fine...what do i Have to worry about right? He's entitled to his life and free time with his friends. But I COULD NOT SHIFT this awful feeling, even had scenarios playing in my head of when he would come home and admit to me what he had done. At this point I am considering the fact I'm going crazy. \n\nSaturday comes a long, we are messaging as he tells me his day drinking will now turn into evening clubbing..admittedly at this point I was a little bothered but played it cool. He suggested I meet up with him. About 30 mins later I turned up at the bar without him realising i was there and he was in this girls personal space at a table. (He knew one of the girls sat on the same table but not this specific girl). I watched him from the bar for about 5 mins and it just came across odd, I wouldn't speak to a male I didn't know in that way.just seemed over friendly. Once he realised I was there he stopped conversing with her at all!! She then went off elsewhere. And just to mention the friend he was with is  a bit of a player \n\nIt just seems a but weird...yes it was only talking..but it gets me suspicious.  What was he doing out of town if he was like this around someone we know at the same table? Why did they stop taking when I turned up? Why do I still feel crazy about this? I cannot shake this feeling. \nSince then he has been overly enthusiastic towards me, commenting on my pics on fb which he never does! Telling me he missed Me when I was at work. \n\nAm I going mad? Whys my gut screaming at me? ",

He has been having an emotional affair with a former employee that worked for him and is 15 years younger.

      "selftext": "Me and my ex dated for over 2 years, from March 2023 to August 2025. I really loved this girl, and I never once felt unloved or unhappy in the relationship. She went out of her way to make me feel cared for, and we were close in every way.\n\nI recently found out she cheated on me with one of my closest friends. It started in June 2025 when I went on a 5-day trip. They didn’t have sex, but they did everything else multiple times, usually when they went clubbing on weekends. I discovered it by accident on her MacBook through iMessages. I confronted her right away and broke up with her on the spot.\n\nSome context: she had a history of being cheated on in her last relationship, so this was shocking to me and everyone who knows us. I also trusted her because I wasn’t the type to go clubbing anymore, but I never restricted her from going. I trusted both her and the friends she went with, including the guy she ended up cheating with.\n\nI also found out she had been lying to me for 2 years about smoking. One of my non-negotiables was no smoking, vaping, or weed. She promised to quit when we got together and never did it in front of me, but I learned she was doing it behind my back the entire relationship.\n\nWhen I confronted her, she admitted she knew it was wrong, that she felt desperate, and that she couldn’t stop herself. She’s now in therapy, crying every day, and keeps sending me long apologetic messages saying she still loves me and wants to make things right. I told her to stop contacting me, and it’s been 4 days of no contact.\n\nHere’s where I’m conflicted:\n\nI still love her and can imagine a future with her.\n\nShe admitted everything to her parents and is taking steps like going to therapy.\n\nMy mom only knows that she kissed my friend, because that’s all I told her at first. The next day I learned it was more (everything except sex), but I kept it from my mom to avoid stressing her. Meanwhile, my ex told both her parents the full truth.\n\nShe keeps texting me about wanting to fix things, but I have huge trust issues now.\n\n\nOriginally in my head I thought if I still felt the same after 4 months, I’d consider taking her back, but only under very strict rules:\n\nShe admits she consciously chose to cheat and liked it at the time.\n\nShe convinces my mom why she deserves another chance and tells her everything herself.\n\nShe tells her own mom everything (which she already did).\n\nWe treat the relationship like an arranged marriage setup, where loyalty is non-negotiable, even above love.\n\nShe makes amends with everyone who knows about what happened.\n\nShe cuts off hanging out with people I don’t trust, no more downtown or going out drinking after work unless I say it’s fine.\n\n\nThe problem is I don’t know if these rules would even rebuild trust or just create resentment. I feel like I could spend years second-guessing her, and I don’t know if that’s the kind of relationship I want to live in. At the same time, this was the best relationship I’ve ever had until the cheating happened, and part of me doesn’t want to throw it all away.\n\nSo I’m stuck: should I try to move on completely, or try couples therapy and rebuild under those rules? I can’t decide for myself.",

Then I find out after a lovely date with him, that he had been sexting an old fling from school. \nI find out and immediately confront. He said it had only been a short time. \n\nI obviously was heart broken. I made him stew and asked him to leave me alone so that I could decide if the relationship was worth it. I weighed out the pros and cons. And decided to try and let him make things right. We both agreed to work on our relationship. \nEverything goes somewhat smoothly obviously hiccups are expected in healing relationship journeys. \n\nMy intuition was spiking one night and I committed the ultimate sin. I logged into his IG on my Laptop so that he couldn't see that I was logged in. I found out he had been replying to this girls story for 7 Months- not just the three days he claimed. (She was blocked at the time of me reading the new info)The messages were the kind of things he said to me at the beginning of our relationship just way more dirty. \nI again confronted him and asked him why lie to me?\nHe said, that I wasn't sexually satisfying him and he wanted more at the time. He also said he was scared I'd leave him as I did say If I found out anything else it would be over.\n\nHe Knew of my diagnosis of Adenomyosis and Endometriosis which can make my sex life painful and I'm less likely to be in the mood but I was happy to do other things.\n\nThis just breaks my heart at this point because I told him if I didn't make him happy or satisfied he needed to tell me so that we could fix it.\nI've never been the type of girl to bite someone's head off for having a conversation.\nI could understand if it wasn't discussed  but I communicated my trauma and feelings and he did too he had any opportunity to tell me. But he lied again.\n\nI'm now just trying to work on myself. I'm letting him do all of the work now as I have nothing left to give.\nWe're in a somewhat of an okay place now but I'm just trying to find my confidence again.",

It’s been a massive trickle truth and somewhere between May and June, I decided to really start working on things with him. Truly thought that he was remorseful. \n\nWe have two daughters which also makes it harder. I wanted to be able to say that I gave it my all. \n\nFast-forward to last week, and not only learned that they had been in contact on and off throughout the last several months, but that he delivered flowers to her at her work. \n\nThis entire affair, to my knowledge was a 6 to 8 month affair and I just learned Saturday night that it is one and a half to two years long. \n\nI have hired an attorney, but I am terrified. I’ve been a stay at home mom for the last year and a half. \n\nI actually just passed my real estate licensing exam last week so that has given me a lot of hope. I know it’s gonna take me a while to get on my feet but just asking for any advice. I am drowning in grief and uncertainty right now and I wanna make sure That I don’t get into a mindset of staying to avoid the uncertainty of the future.\n\nI mean, I’ve known about the affair for months, but after the most recent developments, I feel just like I did the first day when I found out. My heart is just broken. I’m not even surprised at what he did. I’m just disappointed in myself. I thought that he would be different\n\nAny words of encouragement would be greatly appreciated  ",

I'm grieving a life I thought I had. I miss him and his presence but I have to keep reminding myself that it wasn't real.\n\nI feel extraordinary pressure from people around me. Some saying it is up to me if I want to reconcile, others saying absolutely not. He wants me to forgive him and continually makes comments about how much he loves me, he misses me, he made a mistake, he wants me back, all the while sulking that I don't pay him the attention he wants and won't give in and sleep with him.\n\nI'm dipping my toe back into the dating pool simply because I am so tired of my own grief and the noise of my situation that I didn't ask for. I feel rejected by my cheating husband and now feeling rejected by other men. Am I ready to date? No. But I dont want to face my reality.\n\nI moved out and have my own space but when I am there on my own, I feel the most intense lonliness and sadness.\n\nI constantly feel like I am a bother to my friends because some days ok but on the days I am not, I am scrambling for reassurance.\n\nMy confidence in all aspects of my life has been affected, even at work.

      "title": "High school sweetheart of 10+ years cheated, now I’m lost and don’t know what to do",
      "selftext": "For some context, my ex and I were what many people would call high school sweethearts. We started dating when I was a junior and she was a sophomore. We had been together ever since then. Obviously, you share a lot of experiences with someone after that much time—we lost our virginity to one another, went through weddings, funerals, divorces, and everything in between.\n\nIn 2019, I was injured at work and diagnosed with a herniated disc. My doctor pulled me from work, which left me at the mercy of workers comp. Anyone familiar with that process knows it’s a nightmare—late payments, constant questioning of my injury, endless stress. Needless to say, we fell into hard financial times.\n\nFast forward to 2022: after nearly 10 years with my company, I was officially let go. Shortly after, workers comp offered me a settlement. Wanting to get us back on our feet and tired of seeing her struggle, I took the first offer instead of fighting for ongoing payments. As soon as the check came, I caught us up on past-due bills and prepaid rent so we didn’t have to worry for months.\n\nAnother year passed, and I was still struggling to find work that could accommodate my injury. Many employers see workers comp on your record and won’t give you a second look. Luckily, I landed a job at a farming equipment retailer—no heavy lifting, very accommodating. I jumped on the opportunity. But three months in, my manager called me into the office and said every store had to downsize by one person. Being the newest hire, I was let go.\n\nFeeling like a failure, I texted my ex and apologized for not being the provider or man she deserved. She was left paying all the bills again while I looked for work.\n\nFive months later, I found out that a week after I was let go, she started talking to someone who messaged her on Facebook. Her friends began telling her I was a “bum” and didn’t really care about her because I was letting her struggle. This guy told her she could do better and deserved a better future.\n\nThat’s when she changed—not just as a partner, but as a person. She started spending nearly every weekend away. And when I say nearly every weekend, I mean that in those five months, she was only home for one, and that was after I begged her to stay. She also began spending nights at this other guy’s house.\n\nWhenever I asked her to stop, she attacked me personally—questioning my masculinity, my love for her, my ability to provide. At first, I brushed it off, but as time went on, the insults became sharper and more vicious.\n\nOne night, I vented to my brother about what was happening. He told me bluntly, “She’s seeing someone else,” and suggested I check her messages when I could. In late May 2025, she came home earlier than usual, set her phone down, and asked me for a hug. I grabbed her phone and saw she’d been talking to another man for five months.\n\nI confirmed they had slept together at least once, and she admitted she had developed feelings for him. In an irrational, emotional moment, I called her every name in the book, grabbed my dog, and left. The next day I came back and asked to talk. I asked her all the questions you’d expect, and she admitted what happened. I told her I didn’t want to give up, suggested couples counseling, and she agreed.\n\nThe very next day, she was leaving for a Florida trip. While she showered, I checked her phone again and saw she had archived his number and changed it to the name of one of her coworkers so I wouldn’t suspect anything. This guy knew she was with me and pursued her anyway.\n\nI confronted her again. She admitted the deception and blocked him in front of me. She left on her trip. When she came back, her brother showed up, sat me down, and said, “What you and her are doing isn’t working. You need to leave.”\n\nOf course I was upset, but I packed my things. I told her brother it was completely inappropriate for him to interfere in our relationship. I could understand if I’d been abusive, but I wasn’t. After leaving, I didn’t eat or sleep for three days.\n\nNot long after, my dad—who owns a small business—called and offered me work until I could find something more permanent. I took the opportunity and convinced myself that if I proved I wasn’t the man her friends said I was, maybe there’d be a path forward. I started dropping off money for her bills and rent, but nothing changed.\n\nShe told me she still loved me but needed “space.” Fast forward to yesterday—I dropped by to pick up my dog, and who’s there? The same guy. He texted me afterward, saying they’ve been together for five months. He also bragged that he has a wife and another girlfriend, claimed he’s a sheriff, and threatened to have my dog taken away if I didn’t leave her alone.\n\nI reported everything to the authorities, screenshots included. They told me that since I didn’t actually believe he was a sheriff, it wasn’t against the law. But they did say his threat about my dog could qualify for an order of protection.\n\nNeedless to say, I feel completely lost. I don’t have the time or energy to hook up, and I honestly don’t even want to. I just don’t know where to go from here. Any advice would be appreciated.\n",

      "title": "Ex fiancé cheated and left for another man. Now pregnant with the other man’s child 9 months post-separation",
      "selftext": "TLDR - ex fiance (25F) left for another guy and got pregnant. Now I feel some closure because of it. Then through clarity I learned to always trust my instinct.\n\nHi all,\n\nNot sure how to start this, I guess from the beginning? I’ve honestly said this story so many times when I found out about her infidelity about 9 months ago but it’s actually been about 4 months since I’ve actually talked about it like this. So hey! Progress! (She started cheating (from what I know) during November 2025 and she left me December 18, 2025).\n\nSo, I (27M then 26M) was in a relationship with my now ex fiancé (25F then 24F) for about 3 years. We got engaged after the first year and for two years it felt amazing for me. For some history about me, I was in 4 relationship prior, all relatively toxic and I felt attacked because I was a closeted bi-sexual at the time (grew up strictly catholic so even now I’m still struggling with my sexuality but that’s another can of worms for my therapist) and they were all rather conservative and had a toxic view on masculinity. But then enter what felt like the best girl I’ve ever had.\n\nSomeone who I can genuinely call my best friend, one who always talked to me about everything, we held no secrets, we had complete and utter trust in each other and honestly were quite in love. Though the ending would suggest otherwise. After a year of what I understood to be everything I was ever looking for in a female partner at the time, I proposed. It was an immediate and on the spot yes. But then, a couple of years later, came the all too familiar, cold shoulders, lack of communication, no physical intimacy, the usual signs.\n\nI knew who it was IMMEDIATELY. From the beginning I knew the guy was a red flag, my instincts are quite impeccable from being cheated on MULTIPLE times. But I ignored them because I trusted my ex so DEEPLY. She left me saying “she fell out of love” but the weeks leading up to it, the very few things she said to me were “you’re too good of a person to deserve this” “you deserve better.” Which honestly, just shows she’s been cheating for a while but never had the courage to tell me the truth. I ended up finding out about a month later from her friends. Afterwards I honestly just wanted answers. Not an apology. She left with SO many questions unanswered and she avoided and contact or communication with me. I never really received closure and worst of all, I never saw any remorse. That destroyed me, my entire soul believed this girl would always tell me the truth even if it hurt. I needed that from her and I never got it, even now 9 months later.\n\nWell, after about 3 months of deep depression, we’re talking full on 3 month disability leave from work, crying and balling for 3 months straight, losing 37 pounds because food tasted terrible, I started to finally feel a little better and I could eventually take care of myself. I still don’t eat like I used to (boy could I eat a ton) but I’ve honestly recovered so nicely and I’ve made STRIDES the last month and I can confidently say I feel amazing after 9 months. I also have been doing therapy for about 8 months and started EMDR therapy about 7 months ago. I feel amazing and don’t mind sharing my therapy experience as well for those curious :)\n\nWell recently I found out that my ex is actually pregnant now. With the other guys baby. I mean it’s literally them having a gender reveal party and her (she used to always keep her IG private) public IG account posting her pregnancy with the other guy. It’s not mine, like mentioned above, we didn’t have any physical relations for about 5 weeks before she left. But seeing that, idk. It’s so STRANGE. Definitely shocking for sure! The first night I was honestly pretty distraught and got some drinks but then strangely, I felt better after.\n\nI felt as if I finally got the answer I was looking for. That she is, well, pregnant. She’s moved on from what it seems like. She’s out there living her life and now I am out here living my own. I started doing well in work since then and I felt so much relief because I finally got answers. I feel like her pregnancy answered so many things in my head. Mainly that she didn’t talk to me or she avoided remorse because she’s just, this person that I thought I knew. I BELIEVED she was this honest angel but really she’s just, this girl who tried to be good but really was whatever this is now.\n\nThis is why you should wait quite a few years before committing to someone, because they don’t fully show who they are for YEARS. It takes a lot of time to see past what people believe they are and to see who they truly are. And fortunately, it leaks all the time in conversation. Small mentions, small actions, things that don’t seem to mean much at the time but really do. All the times I had mini red flags pop up in the beginning, they all genuinely made me think she was going to cheat. But I ignored them because I believed she was going to prove me wrong. But they were RIGHT. And I’ve been right about this for quite some time.\n\nTrust your instincts. You’re not crazy or overreacting for seemingly little moments that feel as if it truly shows who the person is.",

I don’t want to do any of those things right now, because I’be been in this relationship so long but prior to this I was loving my life having different men for company and sex.

I would catch him in lies and narrative twisting about his past but summed it up to shame or embarrassment and chose to believe he wasn't who he was in the past.\n\n7 months into the relationship he asks if I will move across the country with him for a job opportunity where I could attend my dream college. \n\na week after arriving i made the decision to look through his phone while he was asleep. i became aware he had been attempting to repair the relationship with his ex fiance for months prior to us dating. that it continued after we met and he asked me to move in.  he would alternate the nights we would stay at his house (in retrospect explains why i started dealing with chronic uti for the first time in my life). in addition to him being in contact with her throughout our relationship and paying for an expensive hotel room the day prior to me looking through his phone. I reached out to her and she had no idea I existed and he had made a very strong impression he was moving alone.\n\nI also learned that while he traveled originally for the job interview he not only went and visited his ex wife (marriage prior to ex fiance)  at their previously shared home that he also had been in contact with her through out our relationship via messenger and Snapchat. I even expressed my concern about him going to see her where he'd be in the area and he shared his location while \"going to visit an old hometown friend\" which i later learned was her. he also made her under the impression that he was moving alone and that I did not exist.\n\nthere are more scenarios with him entertaining women throughout our relationship/putting me in uncomfortable situations but I feel as though this post has gotten long enough already.\n\nfinding all of these things out at once I had a breakdown and ended up hospitalized for a week in the psych ward. he visited me everyday and made grand promises to change and be transparent. after being discharged i looked at his phone again and found he'd been telling his ex fiance that I was crazy, he didn't love me and was waiting for me to move back home. along with telling his mother the same thing. his ex wife. an ex co worker he used to sleep with. all the while telling me the complete opposite.\n\nI find myself at a cross road. i have a small amount of savings but am jobless and homeless if i go back home. he estranged me from my family while I was in hospital. I can barely leave bed. I can only sleep for 2 hours at a time and its plagued with nightmares of him. I am losing weight rapidly and the will to live. ive been in abusive relationships before but never this level of lying and infidelity.\n\neverytime I try to leave his convinces me there's nothing for me back home. that the best I will ever get in life is with him. that the only way to a good life is with him. he swears he will change and that he's booked couples counseling for us.\n\neven typing this out i feel so stupid. has anyone ever had any success in a partner actually changing their ways after similar betrayal?

I had so much adrenaline fueling me through the early days, and then terror and panic kept me running until I got things legally settled. Now I feel like it's all hitting me. Am I ok? Has anyone else experienced this delayed kind of trauma response?",

      "selftext": "   Hi everyone. I'm mainly posting this to air out my frustration about this situation. I was with my ex for 2 whole years, and found out in June that she was cheating on me during the final stretch of our relationship. I can't say that I was the best partner, I am a college student about to graduate in December and stress of life definitely caused some neglectful tendencies on my part but I was trying my best to make time for her. I should mention that we were in a long distance relationship during the entire time. It's September now and things have been going well. Lots of awful nights trying to wrap thoughts around my head, crying, drinking, vices that made me a lot worse than I already was are under control and I feel like I'm on a come up for lack of a better word. \n\n  I have an amazing girlfriend now who I love deeply, as I said before I am about to graduate, I started a position at a bank that I love, I've reconnected with all of my close friends who I thought I had lost due to the relationship. Things are going well. However, I can't stop thinking about how much I want to see my ex fail in life. I want her to acknowledge what she did to me and I want people to know about it. Does this make me a bad person? I try to stay off of her page on Instagram but I get curious every now and then and find myself stalking.\n\n  It looks like she's doing well for herself, she's still with her lover that she was cheating on me with, and I can't say that I am happy with that outcome. I don't hate her, I just want to see life take from her as much as she took from me. She made me feel more vulnerable and weak than I've ever been in my life. How do I make her leave my thoughts I feel like I keep being dragged back down whenever it crosses my mind. It makes me sick.",

      "selftext": "I have been absorbing this for a little while now and as it settles I just really need help and guidance. Please don't let this post disappear...\n\nBriefly, I (M33) have been in a relationship with my wife (F33) since college, married for a little over 7 years, and we now have two young kids. Between lots of ups and downs, arguments, stressors, and also wonderful moments we had some true difficulty growing together but we've always centered on one another and our growing family, and over the years our relationship and communication has strengthened.\n\nTrust was a cornerstone I never questioned - and something my wife emphasized - until last month when I stumbled on something that eventually clearly revealed she had started a still active relationship with her horribly abuse ex from high school a few months before we were engaged. Since then they've been in frequent touch and periodically meetup whenever she visits family or friends on the West Coast. Most of our relationship including our entire married life has been underlined by what looks to be a loveless affair; I have seen no indication they strongly care about each other and I genuinely believe she loves me and wants our relationship.\n\nI am beyond devastated, and still working through all this. A lot of general advice discusses how reconciliation is real in even the most difficult situations vs. cutting ties if needed. I have not seen anything about 1) how to address a very long-term (almost 10 years) and still active relation that 2) is with a past abuser and likely has some traumatic/mental health component, and 3) involves two kids I believe are mine who I care about so deeply and don't want to traumatize or hurt.\n\nPlease help if you have resources, guidance, or stories. I am set to meet a therapist and a lawyer. I just feel so lost, empty, and confused, and really need a framework for what my options are. Please.",

I just woke up in a panic attack because for some reason my unconscious mind wanted to bring up the memory of my STBXH starting to hide his phone at night. He used to always keep it in the middle of our pillows so that if our alarms would go off whoever woke up first could wake the other one up. For some reason I remembered that I had woken up in the middle of the night to his phone being gone I got up and looked for it on the ground and in our pillows and it was nowhere to be found. It’s around the time he claims the affair started and then I started spiraling in all the ways he treated me. How he’d make me turn around during sex. Or randomly come in and wanting to have sex even though he hadn’t dropped any hints the entire day or completely ignoring me at my attempts or putting me in odd positions that we had never done before. I just feel gross I feel used. It’s been six months. He’s still with her. I disassociated through the first three post Dday so it felt like so much more time had passed than it actually did. \n\nI’m starting to talk to people again just casually and for the most part I’m doing okay. I haven’t shed real tears in idk how long unless it’s out of frustration due to him being a shit coparent. For example needing help with diapers and him telling me no. But he dropped the kids off yesterday and was dropped down from head to toe in brand new clothes he would NEVER wear when we were together. I legit laughed in his face and said he looked stupid. I mean the outfit was truly horrid and not his style at all. I am very firm in the fact of throwing the affair in his face. Seeing his shame brings me joy as I just sit there and laugh at any little justification he tries to say. I’ve given him the statistics when I first found out. Told him best of luck and I’ll be here to watch it crash and burn because he was and still very much is just following the classic affair patterns and it’s funny asf. \n\nAnyway little rant not really needing much advice just needed to get it off my chest.

      "title": "Need to talk about my experience with infidelity, two years after it all ended.",
      "selftext": "I've made a lot of progress and am at the stage in my life where I can openly talk about what happened to me. I'm making this post because I find many people are trapped in manipulation and denial and have everyone telling them to forgive and forget. \n\nAt the time I found out he was cheating, I (28F) was with my husband (32M) of 7 years. He was in a coma and extremely ill, and when I found out, I had to put all my feelings aside and be supportive to him and his family, even though my heart was so shattered and my life seemingly ruined. \n\nHe had always been a lovely man and partner. He was kind, considerate, and would always spoil me. He was private with his phone but I thought he might be looking at corn or having private conversations with his buddies and family and so I let it slide even though I was always curious. \n\nHowever, there were never any loud signs of infidelity. No physical absences, items found, reportings, etc. \n\nEverything was going so well until a few years ago when he became severely ill and was hospitalised and had to be put into a coma while he was kept ventilated and had other procedures done to keep him alive. It was on valentine's day, a few days after he went under, that his phone (which he'd given to me before going into the ward) received a call from a delivery service asking to confirm a missed delivery. \n\nI said I was his wife and presumed the delivery was for me and they asked me to confirm my name and address, to which the agent replied very awkwardly that I was the wrong person. I thanked him and put the phone down. I checked the delivery app and looked at the order history and saw the order history, and there I found the order for his mistress, and a history of deliveries to her over the years. 5 years' worth. \n\nI was in the hospital when I found out and was in the same area as his mother. I was trying to keep it together but the scale of betrayal was overwhelming and I fell to my knees. His mother saw and came rushing to me shouting, asking what happened, thinking her son had died.  \n\nI said he was OK but showed her the phone. She didn't even blink and berated me, saying that this wasn't important. So, she was in on it, too. She was furious at me for making her think her son had died, but I'm quite sure she would've minimized what had happened regardless. \n\nMy ex died several days later and I never had the chance to confront him about the situation. I had such a strange mixture of grief and betrayal. On one hand, the love of my life had died. On the other, he had kept an emotional relationship with a person I believe was his true love for years. Everyone's focus was of course on his passing and my feelings were pushed to the very back, and no one would acknowledge my feelings or what had happened. So, I swallowed how I felt and tried to honor his passing and be a good widow. \n\nA while after he died I went into detective mode. I scoured his phone, bank accounts, emails etc. and found he'd made many deliveries to her home for many years, helping to support her and her few kids. He'd been in close contact with this woman for five years, messaging and calling her multiple times a week, often probably while we lay on the couch together. \n\nAt first I reconciled that he'd never actually cheated on me, and that this \"Friendhsip\" wasn't as bad as him sleeping with her. But then I went for therapy about the situation and learned about emotional cheating and how it can actually be far worse than physical cheating. \n\nIt took time but I finally confronted my feelings and put aside all that had happened to appreciate and work through my anger, pain, and resentment. I also made it clear to all who knew and loved him closely what had happened and how I felt. They tried to gaslight me and minimize what had happened and make it seem like I was being a bad widow by tarnishing his good name but I finally put myself and my feelings first. \n\nIt's strange, I almost feel external to our relationship and the incident. I no longer resent him and see our relationship as an unfortunate thing that happened, but I'm moving on. I'm with someone new now and they're great, but I am of course a lot more cautious now. \n\n**My advice to anyone going through a similar situation as I did would be:** \n\n* Don't ignore the signs just because they aren't loud. Emotional cheating is real, and secrecy is often cause for suspicion. \n* Don't let others dictate how you feel on something. If your heart was broken, that is real and valid, and no other narrative matters. \n* You can grieve and rage at the same time. It isn't an either or situation. \n* Protect your truth. Family members will often try to convince you you're in the wrong. Don't let them think and feel for you. \n* Therapy does work. I would not have made it through this without a caring and professional person to review the situation with me. \n* You can move on without forgiving or forgetting. It's about putting yourself first and taking control of your life and emotions. ",

Long distance for a few of those years when he came to the UK first. I trusted him completely, like completely. Recently I started getting weird vibes about his second phone which was his old phone which used to stay in the drawer. He started taking it to work and got super defensive whenever I touched it and that’s when I started suspecting him. He deleted everything before handing over the phone to me but I found traces of dating/hookup apps and casual sex site cookies and emails of paid subscriptions, matches. \n\nI finally confronted him, and to get him to talk I lied and said I had restored his phone. He denied everything first but later confessed things I never thought I’d hear.\n\nTurns out, while I was in India and he was here, he had a full-on relationship with another woman. Not just flings , they had engaged in sex regularly and had an emotional connection. The only reason he didn’t marry her was religion. And then… he married me. Because I was the backup. The second option.\n\nOn top of that? He admitted he’s been to prostitutes, happy-ending massage spas, dating apps, sexting sites, all of it. Spending money. Hiding emails. Running a whole double life while still love-bombing me, calling me pet names, acting like the “perfect boyfriend’.\n\nHis was still in touch with AP after marriage. Texted her regularly in-front of me and even asked me to meet her and told me shes one of his best friends.\n\nI feel like such an idiot. Like the dumbest person alive. My family never really approved of our marriage and I fought so hard for him. And now? This. I’m sitting here wondering how the hell I didn’t see it.\n\nI just… I don’t know how to process this. How do you accept that the person you loved with your whole heart was lying straight to your face for years? How do you even tell your family without dying of shame?\n\nI feel worthless. Broken.

      "selftext": "I My wife (28f), a gospel singer, and I (32m) have been together since 2016 and have two kids. In 2017, I made a mistake and had an affair when she found out she told me to break up with the AP and it was done.then after some weeks my wife left and traveled 2000km to her daddy place. After one month, she started a relationship with another man,2 month  then i had to move on and got back to my AP since she called me and told me that i can marry since she will be married and that it was over btn us.after 4 month her relationship ended She then came back, but found that I had already gotten my affair partner pregnant. Since I loved my wife, I ended the relationship with my affair partner and she  asked me to raise the girl after being born. We then started our life together.\"\n\nIn 2024, my wife was recording a live worship and praise event, and I supported her to make it happen. After the event, she came to me crying and asked for forgiveness. Since we had a tendency to tell each other the truth, she told me she had started developing feelings for another man. She asked me to help her get over the feeling, and admitted she even wished our marriage was over. I felt pain, but I tried to help her by caring for her even more. I asked what had made her fall for this other man so I could fix things. She told me she was attracted to his neat dressing and fit body, while I had developed a little obesity. She told me to fix my body and wear more attractive clothes.\"\n\nA year passed, and another issue came up: she started being secretive with her phone. I discovered she had a hidden message on WhatsApp. I managed to unlock her phone and found secret chats with an affair partner who was also her business partner. Their relationship had been going on for a month. In those chats, I saw two weeks of texts detailing how they spent time together, including outings and dinners. She praised the man's body and said he was smart. What surprised me most was that my wife asked the man how he felt about their kiss, saying she felt emotional and that they should meet in a secret place and do it. The man was ready, and they planned a day to meet while I was traveling. Since my travel plans fell through, they scheduled another day after a Sunday church service. My wife planned to tell me she was going somewhere else so they could meet.\"\nFrom then on, I monitored her phone with an app that accessed the camera and sound. The next day, they met, shared a romantic kiss, and hugged for 30 minutes. As I watched, the man drove my wife home on his motorcycle, dropping her off near our house, just as he always did. That night, my wife told me she didn't understand my lifestyle, saying we weren't progressing fast enough. I told her to trust me, pointing out how far we'd come. We started with nothing and now had a house, a car, and three kids in an international school. I was in so much pain that I couldn't sleep for the third night in a row.\"\n\n The next day, the day they planned to meet in the evening, my wife came to me crying and begged me, telling me everything that had happened between her and the man. I told her I already knew because I had seen her texts. She said she was sorry and asked for forgiveness, which I gave her. She broke up with the man and quit her job. When I asked her why she fell for him, she said he cared for her most and showed her romantic signs that led to the kiss and the start of the relationship. I was still hurt. I had been with her for more than 12 years and never had a relationship with anyone else, so I couldn't understand why she would. It was hard to help her get over him. I kept seeing her checking his WhatsApp status and messages, and she kept telling me about the moments they had together. It broke me to see her one-month relationship was stronger than ours. So I kept helping her by caring for her more and more so she could forget the man. Now, a month later, I see she has made progress and isn't thinking about her affair partner.\"\n\nTwo weeks passed. I left the house, taking all of my belongings, and texted her about how I felt about her doing this repeatedly. I told her I would keep paying for the kids' school fees and all other necessary bills. I then checked the phone camera on the app to see how she reacted when she woke up. When she played voice notes from the phone. She started  crying and running around the house, asking God to bring me back, saying she couldn't live without me. After two hours of crying, she called her sister and asked her to call me. Her sister found my phone offline and reported back to her. She kept crying and sending me voice notes about how she felt. As I continued watching her, she took a knife and many tablets to hurt herself. At that point, I had to call her, fix things, and come back home.\"\n\nThe issue I am having is that sometimes I lose trust in her and think she will cheat again. Do you have any advice?\"\n\nTL;DR :\n•\tI (32M) and wife (28F) married with 3 kids we both  cheated in past.\n\n•\tWife repeatedly develops feelings/affairs with other men (business partner most recently).\n\n•\tI discovered secret chats, meetings, and physical intimacy.\n\n•\tWife confessed, begged forgiveness, quit job, but I still hurt and distrustful.\n\n•\tI fears cycle will repeat",

      "selftext": "I get the logic and I think it would be fine IF I got the genuine apology I so desperately needed from the start and accountability was taken... She said from the day I confronted her about 4 months ago now (and had to ask roughly 5 times if she was REALLY where she said she was and not in someones apartment like I suspected) that I couldn't bring it up all the time because it was too much for her to handle. In her defense, her grandpa did just pass and she was certainly effected by it. But I thought she'd eventually reach out to me to give me a genuine and heartfelt apology. It never came unfortunately. I had to tell her within those first few days that I needed to see her express some remorse because she hadn't shown any real emotion in any of our short conversations so far. She cried a little and said she feels bad \"every day\" but she doesnt show it because she \"can't break down all the time\". \n\nFast forward to today and it's unfortunately been a lot of the same story. She hasn't really reached out to me to apologize for anything on her own. And every time she has apologized its mainly been through text. She seems to be very unenthusiastic and uncomfortable when attempting to apologize in person. It kind of scares me 😔. She has had a few good apologies through text. I'd even say some great ones. But again, its been to replying to my needs of one. \n\nShe recently said that she feels like its unfair for me to keep asking her to apologize because at some point I need to do the healing on my own and she cant be my \"emotional regulator\". I asked her if she felt like she gave me an apology that was genuine / good enough for me to heal and she said yes. I didn't want to upset her but I as politely as I could told her that I couldn't recall the occasion she was thinking of... \n\nI even scrolled back through our texts because there's of course tons of stuff over these last 6 months that I've forgotten about... I for some reason felt the need to check if I thanked her for an in person apology or there was any mention of one. Nope. I ended up just finding the opposite actually... just me telling her how important it was for me to hear her take accountability and give me an in person apology quite a few times... \n\nI don't know what to do. I am praying for a moment she has some sort of breakthrough or something and just finally does it... its been so long at this point I think I might not even need to hear her say \"sorry\" I just want to hear her acknowledge the fact the she never apologized on her own and that she cheated on me and shouldn't have... and maybe a little insight on what was going through her head during all of it. I want to know everything. I need a \"everything is out here on the table\" moment and I feel like I don't have that to build anything off of...\n\nI dont know.. I'm starting to lose hope. Am I crazy?",

      "selftext": "Hi All. \n\nWhere to even start? This is between a rant and support post. \n\nI'm 38m. Wife 35f. Together 12 years and married for 4yesrs. 9 weeks ago was DDay, a week before our 4 year wedding anniversary. It was the night before our wedding anniversary trip to South of France I'd planned and paid for. Id dropped the dog off at sitter, drove to Tesco for some dinner shopping whilst my wife was supposed to be home packing before the 5am taxi to airport. \n\nI recall it precisely when my world as I know it ended. 10.31pm I got a simultaneous SMS and WhatsApp message from an unknown number divulging the affair. He was a colleague ofc, cliche, and claimed he'd had sex with her 150 times over last 12 months and they had a secret house and life together, she loved him and wanted his kids etc and couldn't handle the lies anymore. Cunt. What sort of man seds a message like that?\n\nI knew immediately what he was doing and trying to do but it didn't make it any less true. \n\nI took one look up from my phone and at my wife on sofa curled up and knew from her face it was all true. She admitted to the affair but said most of details he had made up to hurt me and to throw a grenade as she had ended the affair recently and refused to leave me for him and he was acting out. Lucky me.  It felt like gaslighting and playing with semantics and she had no answers. He said it was 12 months but maybe it was only 6 or 9months etc - who fucking cares on the number it was a prolonged period right? Was it over did she ever love him? Did she still love him? All the usual questions and she remained fairly emotionless and not a single tear was shed. \n\nI can almost fathom how a ONS or sex can happen. Caught up in the moment , Xmas party I get it. It's still disgusting and deplorable behaviour but I can almost understand how it can happen although whether I'd feel any different I don't know. For me it's the emotional side of the affair that cuts deeper- did she say she loved him and she saw herself having his kids? When we were trying for 4 years for a baby and about to start IVF? Like how much more fucked up can you get?\n\n Don't get me wrong no relationship is perfect and I'm far from perfect husband but god damn id given her everything I could to provide for her and us. from 5* holidays, the big house, expensive engagement ring and wedding, nice clothes and lifestyle to match and I love her family like her nieces and nephews are my own children. I'd had depression for last 5 years so she had to put up with a lot and with it a decline in libido and my affection. I accept I was lacking in the department and the baby making had become mechanical and harrowing as it wasn't successful so sex was no longer fun. \n\ndespite her gaslighting I know that's no fucking excuse to have an affair. And she can fuck off with the lies of my alleged emotional abuse - yes we argued of stupid shit like the dishwasher or taking bins out duty but what couple doesn't? did we get carried away some times with word calling and swearing? Yes. Both of us did and said things we regret. I feel she's painted this narrative that I was some devil and horrid husband who abused her to justify her actions. Every time I bring up the affair she goes back to this: but before you found out what's your excuse for how you treated me? You never wanted sex and showed me no affection and treated me terribly etc etc. She says it so much I'm questioning my sanity and whether I'm the piece of shit or her?\n\n She denied all the gory details of his message of course and said that part about being in love and wanted kids was fake news and there was no house but he had rented an air BnB in town short term for their rendezvous's. Or course she'd say that though as she knew the worst parts would kill me and would be the nail in her coffin and the relationship.\n\nWell I went into a complete state of shock that night that I'm only just coming out of it 9 weeks later. I could barely breathe as million thoughts washed in my head at once. All those times in my gut I thought she'd been a bit strange or sketchy but ignored them as this was my wife and she'd never do something like that. Last person on planet people would super, the classic girl next door type, always putting others before herself etc. \n\nWell I was gaslighted into going on holiday and implored not to tell a living soul especially the family. I admit if any family found out they'd never forgive her and so I didn't tell a living soul and let it eat away at me inside. In hindsight she knows I have a history of anxiety and depression and seemed to have no concern about what a trauma like this may to do me with no one to speak to and when I think about this I resent her for it. \n\nWe spent 10 days out there and acted like nothing had happened and posted on IG and socials what a perfect happy couple we were. My classic survival technique to escape and bury head in sand. Emotions were up and down though and have continued to be. One minute I want her close and to be with her to fuck her brains out and to fuck him out of her... to feelings of absolute vile hatred disgust and resentment. I never know how I'll feel any given day or hour. I'll go from affectionate to pushing her away very quickly. Il make snide remarks and hurtful comments to make her feel an ounce of pain she's made me feel. Why? As she hasn't appeared to show any remorse or contrition. She says she does but what are words anymore? I want actions. Where are the tears and begging and actions to prove I can trust you ever again?\n\nEver since she had been more affectionate and needy. Talking about kids and our future together and seducing me into sex as she wants a family but it feels like she wants to trap me as she knows I won't leave her if she's pregnant with my child. In France it was some of most passionate sex we ever had  in years in the first few days of DDay but I felt disgusted with myself after each time.  Luckily due to the IVF we both had to get std tested a week before the holiday so I knew we were both clean although she must have been worried about results! Luckily she didn't get pregnant on holiday and I've avoided sex ever since. I refused to go to the IVF clinic when we got back and that's all on ice. \n\nWe had some hard conversations on that holiday about what was needed to move forward and ever trust again. Obvious was her to cut all contact with him and one of them had to quit. She said he was due to resign and if not she would. I promised to be better husband and giver her what she needed emotionally and physically but that it would take time to be able to do that again. \n\nWe came home from France and I got another vile message the night before our 4th wedding anniversary from AP.  This time with sordid sex details of what they'd done together in sick detail. I knew immediately it was all true. I felt violated and sick. She took my phone and deleted the message and blocked him. I questioned how he knew we were back and it was our anniversary - he'd planned that message accordingly the timing was too perfect. Then it came out she'd messaged him on holiday - in her words to tell him to back off and leave her alone. Of course none of these messages existed anymore. That was her first test and she had failed. She's also deleted all previous messages with him too - his message said they'd exchanged thousands which I believe and can only fathom the hurtful things I'd read. \n\nBefore DDay I had handed my notice in. For a new job she encouraged me to apply for that would allow better work life balance to raise a family. Leaving a firm and team I loved for the better of our family. Luckily my workload then fell of a cliff or I don't know how I'd cope. I compartmentalised everything telling myself get through the next month and then you are going travelling etc. \n\n I tried doing therapy but I think it was too soon but I did eventually crack up and had to tell my two best friends and have an outlet. They are as shocked as me but are supporting me. \n\nI asked her a few times to move out and give me space. She refused each time as I think she knows once she's out of sight I may come to my senses. She's here on first two weeks of my trip (having been booked before I knew) and part of me can't wait for her to leave and go home and to be on my own. In my head I've told myself the 3 weeks on my own will be my thinking time and decision making time but in also scared if I'll just break down mentally. I'm torn between loving her and hating her. Wanting to get revenge and scorch earth - well if you shag someone else so will I but knowing I'm not that person.\n\nI'm not sure I have the strength to leave her or the strength to work through it. Financiallly separating right now would be disastrous. I've just quit my job and gone travelling on my savings and new job isn't for another month so I won't get paid til December. Then we have a huge mortgage together and a dog together. How do I unpick all that?\n\nI guess my question is, am I being sensible to think I continue to pretend to play happy families and blindside her a year until I've rebuilt my savings and got my ducks in a row? I may just check out physically and emotionally in that time and avoid sex etc until I can approach this quietly and calmly? Or is it better to rip the bandaid off and walk away as once a chest always a cheat? I feel like my decision making and sense of judgement is hugely impaired. I thought I'd picked a good egg, not a rotten apple.\n\nSorry it ended up being a rant.",

One was 7 months, second 3 years, third 2.5 years, and this last one 7 years.\n\nI've been cheated on in every single one (all emotional affairs as far as I know). My first one, he was flirting and sexting with a classmate and left me for her. Second, he suddenly dumped me a year in for his ex but when she turned him down he came running back to me (and I stupidly took him back), third was more flirting and \"I love yous\". And my most recent one was a LDR full of sexting and \"I love yous\" and plans to meet up and promises to leave me.\n\nWhats up with this? Like, after the third time I promised myself never again. I knew that I was possibly ignoring red flags, attracting the wrong people. All of my exes before this last one were plastered with them. I gave up on dating but met a guy who wasn't hurt a basement dwelling unemployed neck-beard. He was intelligent, going to college, and working. He treated me right, never swore at me during arguments. Bare minimum I know. But I thought I was making the right moves to a healthier view of relationships. \n\nThen he cheated. For 7 months. Fell for this girl. And then claimed it was due to my low libido (from hormonal bc) that he was \"filling a void\" by flirting with girls on discord and... Feelings just developed. \n\nI am destroyed. I finally got to a place where I trusted him and believed fully he'd never ever hurt me like that. \n\nHow do I ever even consider starting over? I am almost 30. I was planning on having kids with this guy. Marrying him. But now... I'm not sure I am capable of loving this way again. I don't think I will ever be able to trust anyone  so wholly again. At least... Not anytime soon.\n\nWhy do I keep getting cheated on?

I was with someone for a period of around 10 years, recently engaged when soon after she decided to start cheating with multiple colleagues. Found out within a couple of months, and immediately terminated the relationship when I did.

I've shed a decent amount of weight, and I'm in a much better space mentally. I still struggle with dark days often. I would say the balance currently is around 50/50 between good and bad days.\n\nFor months now I had been wondering if ever there would be a day when I just don't think about what happened, my ex or the guys she was with.

Staying is the only guarantee of the worse outcome.\n\nEven if it’s terrifying, choosing yourself is about honoring your own worth, your peace, and your future. You might not see the whole path ahead, but leaving creates the possibility for healing, happiness, and growth. Things that staying could never give you.\n\nChoosing yourself doesn’t erase the pain, but it says: I matter. I deserve better. I won’t let fear keep me with someone who broke my trust.\n\nSometimes the bravest thing you can do is step into the unknown, because staying is the only way to suffer for sure.\n\nYou’re loved \n",

They said if we are to stay together how things currently are they will cheat again.\n\nI just think that their “healing” is going to be talking and dating other people, etc. \n\nShes convinced as the way things are we cannot be together. And I just don’t want to play these relationship games of every 3 years jump into a new one and stuff. I’d rather water the grass now because that’s where it’s greener.\n\nWP says she will resent me and be unhappy if she stays with me. But I think I’ll resent her and will be unhappy if they leave me and that’s the issue here.\n\nShe also says she wants to kill herself… and she’s said that the whole relationship. I do suspect possible boarderline personality disorder. And I think I need to let her go because that isn’t right either. But then I’ll be miserable.\n\nI just don’t know what to do. It feels like we are running away from things instead of working on our issues together.",

When I asked if there’d ever been any history with anyone in the group, my partner told me they’d kissed one of the people years ago, but nothing came of it.

My anxiety has been through the roof since finding this out.\n\nI’m curious — for those of you who’ve been cheated on, what have your experiences been like when dating again?

He said growing up he didn’t know what love means from his parents and also he was always the second choice and maybe that might relate to this. \n\nIdk why but I am having very hard time to convince myself to leave.

      "selftext": "Hey all, first time posting like this and my head is spinning, so I hope this makes sense.\n\nThis past Thursday morning I discovered something nobody wants to see. I noticed for a couple weeks prior that she had been very secretive and private with her phone, but I didn’t think much of it until Wednesday night. I was entering the room and she was sitting on the couch on her phone. I noticed she was quickly closing apps, and one of them I was sure was Bumble. Instead of asking her then, I just went to bed immediately.\n\nThursday morning I decided to check her phone while she showered (I never do this but felt it was necessary here). Nobody could’ve prepared me for what I found. She had a Bumble account, Reddit, and Snapchat that she was all using for this. She was chatting with a dozen dudes on Bumble, 20+ on Reddit, and a handful on Snapchat. My heart broke. \n\nAs I read further, I found evidence that she filmed two of her encounters, and I saw them. The images and sounds are burned into my head, I can’t stop seeing them. Apparently, she slept with seven different men over the course of August and was planning at least three more for the next two weeks. She showed no signs of slowing down until she was caught.\n\nNow she expects that she can salvage and rebuild this. I don’t know. I had a feeling she was off, and there was a night she said she was going to see a “friend”, which I now know she went to a hotel to fuck. However, I asked her earlier that day if she was going to cheat that night, and she promised me no. I helped pick out an outfit for her, kissed her bye, and she left. Four hours later she came home smelling bad, but blamed it on the restaurant they went to. We then proceeded to make out and have sex.\n\nHer double life has terrified me, and I don’t know what to do. She says she wants to rebuild through transparency and counseling, but I don’t know. She admitted that if I hadn’t investigated myself, she probably wouldn’t have told me the whole truth.\n\nI don’t know. I’m just in shock still. Seven men in one month and showed no signs of slowing down. I feel sick. For context, I’m 27M and she is 25M, have been together since May 2019 and planned to marry next year.",

He’s from England and I am from the U.S. We got married, moved in together and went through a whole immigration process where he was granted his green card in May after our interview. I found out last week, that he had been cheating on me for the past 4 months (but most likely longer.) Our interview was May 2, and he started a relationship with this girl on May 20th. \n\nHe had a friend that was a girl, that he would not let me meet but I was supportive of because I wanted him to make friends. For the past 4 months, I have been asking him to meet her and if anything was going on, and he would shout at me and tell me that I am just jealous and can’t accept him. He made me doubt myself for the past four months. \n\nI found out that the money I had given to him during the time that he couldn’t work, he used to take this girl on dates and to buy her gifts, they were intimate without me knowing ( I now have to get STD tested) she stayed in my apartment when I left this summer for a trip, and he told her that I was just his friend helping him immigrate here. They still want to be together and my husband still lives in my apartment while actively dating her. \n\nAlso, when I messaged this girl to ask what was going on because I found a love letter, I let my husband know before hand. Once I told him, he went after me to grab my phone from me and he put his hands on me for the first time ever in our relationship. He left bruises on my arms and screamed in my face while chasing me around the apartment.  \n\nThe immigration attorney is recommending that I report my situation because this makes me look complicit in immigration fraud, based on his story of us just “being friends.” My husband told me that I have a choice to make and that ultimately the outcome of his life is in my hands. I have never been in so much pain in my whole life with such huge decisions to make and just so much confusion on wether or not I was being emotionally abused this whole time.

      "selftext": "Hi everyone, I need some advice because my head and heart are spinning right now.\n\nMy boyfriend (M) and I (F) have been together for 5.5 years. He is the only person I’ve ever been with, emotionally and physically.\n\nFor the past month, I’ve been struggling with my mental and physical health. He has been expressing his needs to me, which I havent been able to meet. Not because I didn’t love him, but because I was drained, and I expressed that. Between my body image issues, working full-time, taking classes full-time, and studying 8-12 hours a day for the MCAT, I just have been struggling.\n\nI finally finished my MCAT yesterday (yay) and woke up this morning wanting to surprise him but I went to his camera roll and saw naked photos. They weren’t for me. I went to his discord and saw that he sent multiple pictures and videos of himself to a random girl. Not only that- there were very explicit, sexual texts between the two .  This has been going on a month.\n\nI told him to leave, but we live together and I don’t know what to do next. I feel broken, ashamed, and honestly…partially to blame. Why couldn’t he have just talked to me? Or maybe gone to therapy? He’s been going to the gym and started testosterone recently, so part of me is wondering if that changed his urges.- but I just I don't know what to do.\n\nWe also live together. I truly do not wan't to break up, but I don’t know how to move forward. I don’t want to tell my friends or family because I feel embarrassed, like I wasn’t enough for him to stay loyal.\n\nSo my questions:\n\n* Could cheating ever excusable in a situation like this?\n* How do you even start the breakup process when you live together?\n* How do I move on and tell my friends/family.\n* For those who’ve been through it, what are the actual steps when you live with someone?\n\nAny advice or perspective would help so much.\n\n  \nUpdate: Found out it was MULTIPLE people online for FOUR of the years. While I went to my home country with my family for 2 weeks over the summer he physically cheated on me with 4-5 people as well. I feel disgusting. He was my first everything. I gave him everything I could. He made me feel like I was so loved. I told him to get his stuff and move. There is no excuse for all of that, now I know. I will try and be better for myself mentally.",

After everything we been through I made sure she was reassured taken care of and always there for her and she was for me. It was perfect and sure I had paranoia but I kinda was always like that and she was too (her first relationship she got cheated on a lot) and her father cheated on her mom and left the country which makes no sense to me how she would do this to me. She cheated on me with her one of her girl best friend and they both don’t even talk like that anymore and it’s so frustrating how someone can just give up their body so easily for one night of pleasure, I don’t care if they were drunk and slept over its a choice she made. But this girl really changed who I am as a man and I emotionally matured and focused on my career goals and helped her focus on her goals since she started college and I’m almost out. I know I shouldn’t disrespect myself like that but I also want to take a long break and tell her to get help and become a better person not just for me but for herself because no matter what decision I make I’m going to be moving foward thoughout my future but god I wish she was there to help support me.",

What I can't get over is that she claims to not remember anything about the texting. Just that it was \"probably\" Inappropriate. \n\nAlso what I can't get over is that she seems unwilling or unable to recall ANYTHING about the texts. I'm not asking for a word for world recall. But come on, she should at least be able to give me more on the tone and feeling of these messages. Sure as hell the ones from 10 years ago. \n\nI'm stuck. ",

So I guess the next best thing is to put it up here for the internet to see xD \n\nI don't even know how to start this, I'm just having a hard time in general. 4 years ago I broke things off with my ex fiance as he had cheated on me and the relationship was just toxic and mentally draining, like I mean I was constantly having to reassure him that I loved him (No issues with that, but it was every day and multiple times a day, it wore me down after a while) I never got me time, when I did I was being face timed or called and the conversation was not ever present, it would just be silence because I was just mentally drained from him, I didn't want to speak. It seemed like whenever I tried to communicate things it would fall on deaf ears. Things slowed down between us, he had a high sex drive and I tried to keep up, but it's not how I work I guess. He sought attention elsewhere in the moment where I actually had time to myself, he had gone to the doctors and then installed Grindr or whatever, hooked up with someone. He didn't tell me until a year later, 6 months after being engaged. It was my first relationship, ever and I was too naive to leave any sooner. We were together for 3 years, glad I got out of that. \n\nI don't think you ever get closure from stuff like that, like how can you? I immediately just tried to move forward, I thought moving forward and just focusing on myself was the best thing to do. But in doing that, I shut myself out. I lost contact with friends, I didn't go out much. I did well, initially, like I lost a bunch of weight and seemed to be happier but still never addressed what had happened between us. Life kept moving forward, I figured things out for myself and cracked my egg, started transitioning. I went on a couple of dates that went no where just this year, but two weeks ago I did go on an amazing date with an amazing person. Things seemed to go really well, very lovely and cutesy which is what I needed and wanted. She's amazing but is dealing with her own personal issues and things have shifted. I'll admit I fell too hard too fast, which isn't a bad thing I guess. But what's bad is that she has admitted to self sabotaging and dealing with imposter syndrome, like she doesn't deserve the happiness she gets. I thought I was over my insecurities from my ex, but being with her and going from lovey dovey to pulling back and going pretty quiet has opened up a can of worms I thought I had dealt with (by not dealing with it, I know, stupid) my anxiety and insecurities are going through the roof and I'm quite literally tearing myself apart. I guess I just never realised how alone I was, and it's hitting me like a tonne of bricks, it's so overwhelming, too overwhelming and I hate myself for it. \n\nI feel like I'm ruined by my ex, like he still has this grip on me. It's been 4 years and I'm still affected by it, what is this shit? I shouldn't be feeling this way, I should be happy that I've moved forward, right? I just feel at a loss, how can I try and get into a fresh relationship after all this time but be so affected by my insecurities. I know this probably all seems silly, but I am just venting.",

      "title": "Mom had an extramarital affair when I was 12 and I'm still affected by it",
      "selftext": "Hi, 23F. I've never shared this before so this will probably be a long post, sorry. So it's been over 10 years since my mom cheated on my dad and I think that's the one thing that absolutely destroyed my perception of her, besides her crazy controlling personality.\n\nTo give some background, this incident happened when I was a kid so I did not have the foresight to collect any evidence but I vividly remember all the details and I have vented about it in my journals from those times too. My parents did not live together as I was growing up because they worked in different cities and I lived with my mom along with my younger sibling. My dad used to visit every other week and I never thought there was something wrong with my parents' relationship until this happened.\n\nFirst, the discovery. I used to play games on my mom's phone and discovered her talking inappropriately with another man. She had his number saved as the name of some official looking group chat and it seemed related to her work at first glance but I remember locking myself in the bathroom with her phone, perusing the chat and just bursting into tears. I felt reality shatter around me at the time and I couldn't process it at all. I kept noticing what she did even more after that day and her elusive behavior was obvious enough, even to a child like me.\n\nThe worst part is that this man was her senior married colleague and both of them kept hanging out and even kept up a charade of being family friends: I remember her facilitating a dinner between this man and my dad and I remember my entire family going over to his house and meeting his wife and children too. I was the only one who knew and it was suffocating. She'd lie to my dad that she had no idea about that man asking to meet him when I'd previously overheard them on call furtively discussing this very meeting.\n\nFast forward a few weeks or months, my sibling got into a life-threatening accident. It was really hard because at the time we lived in a small town without proper hospitals so my mom later got a transfer and we decided to move to the city for better recovery prospects. My dad had sustained injuries trying to save my sibling and he was undergoing treatment at the hospital too. I couldn't stay because I still had school back in the town so I crashed with some relatives there and only went to visit my sibling from time to time.\n\nYou'd think that such a traumatic incident would make my mom reconsider her actions, but no. I was witness to the fact that this man and my mom still met and still talked on the phone, even in the hospital. My dad was starting to get suspicious around this time and I finally spilled what I knew about her texting \"someone\" while having their contact saved as the name of a group chat. I think he believed me because he also had a similar hunch but I think my parents talked about it and it soon died down and nothing ended up happening.\n\nMeanwhile, I distinctly remember this one instance so clearly that it still makes me recoil in disgust. The man took me and my mother out one day and we went to a bookstore because I was fond of reading and he planned to buy me books, even though I never asked for any of this. I was looking at some other sections and I made my way back to where the two of them were standing and - they were holding hands. I couldn't even pretend not to see this shameless display but they broke apart immediately and that was that. I felt sick to my stomach but I didn't know what to do. The atmosphere at home already wasn't very good because of my sibling's condition so I didn't say anything at the time and I still regret it to this day.\n\nNext, we were planning to move to the city and this one time my mom brought me and my sibling to stay at this five star hotel and told us to order room service while she went out to see apartments with this man and returned very late at night. My dad had gone back to his job in the other city around this time and we were back to fortnightly visits. I genuinely don't know how I managed all of that on my own since I couldn't confide in anyone.\n\nSoon after we moved to the city, this \"secret relationship\" petered out, even though this man also lived in the same city by then. I don't know what exactly happened between them or between my parents but things were resolved and presumably they talked it out but I'm sure my dad doesn't know the specifics and only knows whatever my mom told him. Probably involved hysterics and some manipulation. My dad told me a couple of years later that the adults had already discussed the \"misunderstanding\" and there was nothing for me to be worried about.\n\nThere is no crazy exposé here. In my country, marital affairs are very taboo and hush-hush. It's been more than 10 years now. My parents have been living together under the same roof for the past 5-6 years and things seem to be fine between them. I also don't think my mom has had any other affairs. It's only me that still remains fixated on the past.\n\nMy relationship with my mother has never been the best because I still remember the childhood abuse (both physical + verbal) disguised in the form of strict parenting and tough love which continued well into my late teens and well, she still taunts and yells at me now, to the point where I wish I could go no-contact. There's a lot of horrible stuff that I'm omitting here but basically, trashy parenting style that's left me devoid of any confidence or trust in her.\n\nI think I could still cope with that if I had any respect left for her but everytime she pulls some crap with me or starts grandstanding about her own morals or struggles in life, it just makes me roll my eyes so hard. Whenever she goes on about a flaw of mine I can't help but be reminded of her own dirty laundry and the fact that I have never hurt a person the way she did. It just reeks of hypocrisy.\n\nI guess besides her personality, she's supported me, done stuff for me that I should be grateful for and looked after me like a parent should. I just don't think I've managed to process my feelings about her affair even after all this time and I don't know if I can ever make my peace with it. My sibling doesn't know anything about this incident and their relationship with my mom seems to be way better than mine.\n\nThat's all, I mostly just wanted to finally vent about this but if people who are/have been in a similar boat have any advice or insight to offer, I'd be really happy to listen.",

A few weeks ago I discovered he was chatting with a girl from his work, being very flirty and talking about a “hang out” that had happened between them. I confronted him and he said he would end it and apologized, I decided I would stay and we would work on our relationship. Fast forward to yesterday, I discovered he has been using a different messaging app to sneak around and continue talking to this girl. For me, this was the moment I decided I can’t make it work with him. However, I was just accepted into nursing school and will have my RN after this 2 year program, and he is the one that will be working while I am in school. I’m planning on finishing the program and secretly getting things in order for the kids and I to leave. My question is, what are things I should get in order now before we leave?

I have my reasons, three of them, for not throwing away a 23 year relationship lightly, though I understand I am being pushed towards D at this point. \n\nBottom line is that if I file I intend to file for infidelity (meaningless in my blue, no fault state, but more of a statement that I didn’t cave bc my “feelings” changed or whatever). I think it’s only fair to tell my kids (HS/MS aged) the reason, in age appropriate terms, for the divorce. I am unconvinced by arguments that this is dragging the kids into a grownup argument or using them as pawns. I think my wife did what she did and if we cannot reconcile our kids should know their lives are not being blown apart bc of some fickle emotional changes - emotional changes they might think their parents might have about them - but rather something serious. I don’t feel the need to protect my wife from the consequences of her actions. If my kids forever harbor resentment against her for her betrayal of the family then so be it. \n\nChange my mind. \n\nThanks \n",

      "title": "He keeps talking to women. I don't know how to move forward.",
      "selftext": "Sorry for the length. I have been in shambles for the past week.\n\nI'm just shattered. I'm 27, he is 29. We have been together for 4 years and married for one year and a couple of months. We went through hell and back to finally get married (family issues) and he worked his ass off to finally marry me. I thought it would be smooth sailing after we finally got married.\n\nA couple of months into the marriage I noticed he was too friendly with random women on social media, be it girls he knew tangentially through work or just through his network. Random DM's, replying to their stories, texting about random things here and there, but nothing crazy and nothing outright inappropriate. No \"you're pretty\" or \"hey you're cute let's get to know each other\" etc. Just chatting when he didn't need to be, liking photos, etc. I did find one conversation with a woman that I thought was very inappropriate: he would vent to her, seek emotional support about work, text her when he finished work, etc. I noticed he randomly stopped texting her without me having to tell him. The conversation with her lasted about a week. We fought majorly over all of this and he promised it wouldn't ever happen again, that he was being stupid, etc. We supposedly got past it. I'd find little things here and there but nothing egregious so I'd let them go.\n\nThere is one woman (25) he works with on a few projects who lives in a different country. She was his mentee and he was transparent about communicating over text, phone, etc, doing it in front of me. I didn't have any issuues with this because it seemed professional. One day, we were on vacation together, and he opened his phone next to me. I noticed he had specifically locked the chat with her only. I lost my mind, left the vacation without him, etc. He apologized and said there was nothing, that he just didn't want me to \"freak out\" if I saw her name pop up because \"I'm very jealous when it comes to women\" (I'm not - he is just not trustworthy and doesn't know how to stick to boundaries as a married man). He showed me some of the messages and they were innocent enough I guess. It took me weeks to forgive this and I got my family involved. He promised them nothing like that would happen again, that he will be fully transparent with his phone, that he will stop having unnecessary conversations with women. This was 5 months ago.\n\nThe last thing he told me about this woman was that he would tell her to only email him from now on, no more messages or calls, to maintain professionalism. I believed this.\n\nFast forward 5 months later to last week. I decide to check his phone for the first time since that incident. The ground fell out from under me. He's been talking to this woman every single day for the past 5 months. Talking about everything under the sun. Emotional support, they vent to each other, they joke and tease each other consistently, he tells her he's seen how vulnerable she is, asks her opinion on where he should move next for his next bout of training, talking about how she needs to be wary of horny guys at work (they're in the same field) etc. Asked her if she wanted him to find her a job where he works because he has connections. She would compliment him, on something like his \"social skills\" for example, and he would ask multiple times why she thinks that of him. They would talk on the phone for an hour and then she would text him a compliment after the phone call and he would eat it up. Texting for hours. EXTREMELY close. Phone calls, messages, constantly. While I had ZERO clue. What hurt the most was that in 5 months of messages, neither of them mentioned me one single time. It's like I didn't exist. She knows he is married. I was operating under the impression that he was only emailing her because I took his word for it and because he has not mentioned her in 5 months. I now know he was deceiving me this entire time.\n\nI lost it. Kicked him out of the house. Went to see my family and told them everything. At first, he was adamant that he didn't do anything wrong, that he was being \"professional\" (!) and that it was about work (!). I told him not to kid me, that \"work\" USED to be what they did when the messages were all about the projects they had to finish. I told him that he blatantly went from professional work conversation to best friend territory while deliberately deceiving me and immediately after he promised he would avoid unnecessary conversations with women. Sure, the conversations generally centered around their field, but do not play stupid and act like just because you threw a work word in there it's suddenly professional.\n\nI can't eat or sleep. Who knows where it would have led if I didn't find the messages. To be clear, none of the messages were romantic, but she was clearly trying to flirt and he was clearly eating it up, and I would not call any of what I saw an appropriate friendship especially behind my back while I believed it was email only.\n\nI am at a loss. His mom and sister are fully on my side and are extremely disappointed. They told him he doesn't deserve me. My family is the same. This isn't the first or second time, and it wasn't one or two messages. 5 months of deceit. And for what?\n\nHe is finally out of \"I didn't do anything wrong\" mode and is now trying to \"fix\" things but it feels lackluster. I don't think he is capable of change. He's a liar and deceives with no issue. He supposedly blocked her but I don't even believe that. He's telling me he knows he fucked up and that he knows he doesn't deserve more chances but that he can't imagine losing me. He's not done anything concrete yet though and I don't want to give him the playbook. It doesn't feel like he is exactly terrified to lose me and honestly, if he was, he wouldn't have done this shit behind my back and risk losing me when he knew it was a clear dealbreaker. He's been saying he can change, that he wants to be the man I deserve, that he is embarrassed, blah blah blah.\n\nI filed for divorce yesterday and told him so. He seems to be in shock and just keeps asking to talk about it. I won't believe a word he says because we have been through this entire spiel before and here we are again.\n\nAt the same time, I adore this man and I know he adores me. He (besides this GLARING problem) treats me like a princess and love pools in his eyes when he looks at me. I just cannot get past this and I can't stop wrorrying about what it might escalate to later. He did stop the Instagram nonsense so he's using that to show he's \"changed\" some things but come on, to change that and then do THIS?\n\nIt's either he just truly doesn't give a fuck about me anymore, which is hard for me to believe because of all he went through to marry me and because of how well he treats me generally (besides this..I know), OR he is majorly insecure and needs external validation from women at any expense, OR he is into her. Either way, I don't see myself living like this. He takes me for a fool is what it seems like. I am a really damn good wife and he admits that without hesitation so I just can't believe I'm dealing with this.\n\nI just need nonbiased opinions. I don't know if I should give it another chance after being separated for a while. Or just end it even though it would hurt. There is a niggling \"but he didn't say anything romantic so maybe it's not that bad\" but no - 5 months of secret \"friendship\" with a woman we had issues over before is not innocent.\n\nI am so lost and so sad. Anything helps. Thank you all.",

      "selftext": "So, I'm 6 months post D day. Found out my wife was having a long term affair with a work \"friend\", someone who had been in our home, met our kids, who I'd even suggested she bring to a Christmas party I was throwing as she always had difficulty making friends. \n\nThe level to which she'd brought this affair into every aspect of our lives was ridiculous, and I really feel it was only my faith in her that meant I didn't catch on much earlier. I have so much anger, but so little place to put it, as more than anything else I don't want this to impact our children's lives more than it absolutely has to. \n\nThe marriage isn't fixable. I know that, and I'm under no illusion that the conflict I feel there isn't a want to fix it, it's grief over losing something that was my entire world. She will be moving out, and is searching for a place that she can share custody of our children in. (For those questioning timeliness I had agreed she could stay in our home until my daughter started school and she could work full time and afford a place - this has now passed so now she's able to look for somewhere)\n\n3 weeks ago was what I hope was rock bottom - I was spiralling emotionally, couldn't see any way forward I could be happy in, and had written a letter to my little boy saying goodbye. Thankfully I saw that deep dark place for what it was, and reached out to my doctor (who was minimal help) and my people to let them know how low I'd gotten. I hope that's the lowest I get, as my children deserve a father who is there, present and whole, and that needs to be my priority. \n\nBut I'd like to ask anyone who's been in a similar place - does the anger and sadness lessen with time? And what did you find helped? I feel like there's times I can be distracted for it not to be in the forefront of my mind, but everything that ends it blares back with a vengeance and all the deep deep sadness and rage comes back as strong as ever. Any advice would be welcome. ",

      "title": "My boyfriend of 5 years cheating on me the last 2 months of our relationship and I don’t know what to do (sorry this is so long there’s a lot to unpack)",
      "selftext": "I’ve been with my ex boyfriend for 5 years. We met when we were both 19 in 2020 and were 9 months apart. I’m not 24(F) and he’s turning 25 in a couple days. \n\nLong story but I found out my bf hacked into my social media accounts (snap,discord, TikTok, emails,etc.) for over 2 years and I had no idea. When I found this out I went through his phone to delete all my stuff and passwords of his phone. While doing this I found his hookup list in his notes app where I found out that I was girl 19/20. I asked him what this was and he swore to me that the list was not in order, and that he never cheated on me and swore to me a million times it was true. Fast forward I took a mental image of girl 20/20 on the hook up lists name in my head, and ended up finding her Snapchat and asked her myself if it was true if he cheated on me with her. \n\nSurprise surprise, she admitted everything and told me they’ve been hanging out for months and went on lunch and coffee dates and car hang outs together. I asked her if they did anything physical and she said they had sex in her car once (it was actually twice but could even be more than that) near my bday in June 🥲. She told me she felt super guilty which made me sick to my stomach, since she knew about me the whole time and knew he had a gf. But she apparently “seduced him to have sex with her”. When I confronted my ex about this he denied everything and told me she was lying even tho I had the proof of her msging me confessing everything on my phone. We ended up calling her together and she still confessed over the phone that it was true and he still continued to deny it. After arguing back and forth for 45 mins he finally admitted that he indeed did sleep with her but only once and that he was drunk and it was a huge mistake that he regretted instantly. \n\nThe next day I asked for the truth of how many times it really happened cuz I didn’t fully believe him, since he’s been off work for 2 months and I’ve been working two jobs so barely saw him. He then admitted that he actually slept with her twice, even tho he said it was a one time mistake. I asked then how was it a mistake u regretted if u went back for seconds and u weren’t drunk the second time. \n\nFor backstory me and my ex were having a lot of issues back when this cheating started. He was cheated on in the past so he had a lot of anxiety and insecurity issues and at times was jealous of me. This is also why he said he hacked into all my socials without me knowing, so he could see if I was up to no good. He never fully trusted me since the start cuz of this even tho I was always loyal,\nso I always had to be extra careful with my words and actions so I felt like I could never be myself. Example I said that I loved the weeknd when I went to the concert and he got super offended and mad at me. It felt at times i couldn’t be myself and had to walk on eggshells because he was sensitive and would get upset, but I loved him so i didn’t mind. He also had a history of being impatient with me and has snapped at me or yelled at me at family events when he was hungry or if I made a joke he didn’t like. Have you we’ve been together for 5 years so we got to used to eachother and to comfortable at times cuz our honeymoon phase was definitely over. This caused a huge disconnection between us and we were fighting almost every week since I got home from my 2 week vacation with my girls the month before the cheating started. I also worked two jobs (60+ hours weekly) so I barely saw him and when I did I was so exhausted and drained I barely had energy to give to him like he did for me. This created a huge disconnection between us and at times I was too exhausted to be intimate and he has a high sex drive. \n\nCuz of all this when I caught him he told me he went to this girl originally just to be her friend and to get “therapy/relationship advice” from her, but one thing lead to the other and they ended up having sex. And he wanted to recreate that spark her use to have with me with her but it didn’t end up working so he stopped after 2 times. He also thought I was planning on leaving him which is also why he did this, but after every fight I’ve always ended it with I love u and even tho it’s hard rn I’m not leaving you I wanna fix this cuz I only want you in the end and no one else. \n\nOnce I heard this I blamed myself for everything. I still do tbh it felt like it was all my fault. I didn’t love him enough, I let other life issues I had get the best of me and wasn’t giving him my all cuz I got distracted by every other stress in my life that didn’t matter, I wasn’t giving him enough sex, I wasn’t giving him the attention and love he needed and deserved. \n\n\nI still feel this way which is why I still feel guilty, and Ik he says it’s a mistake and I must say he’s very remorseful and sorry and he even started therapy to fix himself cuz he wants to get back together. My family and friends hate him so idk how I could go back, but also idk if I could trust him again cuz of all the lies and times he was deceiving. I’m going from depressed sad to angry to happy. I feel insane and don’t know what to do. I miss him so much he was my best friend and we did everything together for 5 years. and still love him so much I can’t hate him if I tired. In 5 years we built up so much for our future together, I really thought this was my soulmate and the man would end up with. We were even supposed to get engaged in 2026 cuz we talked about it and I found the note of how he was planning our trip to Italy and what ring he was buying me for our engagement next year. I love his family so much too they became my own. \n\nI feel lost I can barely function like i used to I feel like a huge part of me died and our future together did too. This is so painful I feel like it wasn’t supposed to end like this and I’m part to blame but idk what to do. I love him so so much I still consider my best friend and hate seeing him heartbroken too. I wish this never happened so we could just go back,  and I see how sorry he is and wishes he could take it back but idk what to do. Especially cuz I still love him and worked so hard to be with him cuz I truly saw my life with him. But idk what to do now cuz there’s no guarantee if I take him back that this won’t happen again since I forgave him. I feel like after this happened he realized what he lost and we have potential to be back stronger and better than ever. But Ik that might just be a façade. Ik I prob sound crazy or delusional I’m just so sad, betrayed, and heartbroken and just miss and love him so much and wish this never happened so we could stay together. Like why🥲",

      "selftext": "I was recommended this sub by r/marriage.\n\nBare with me here, I don't typically go to reddit for advice but I'm not sure what to think or do here. Husband and I have been married for 15 years, two kids. Recently I've learned he's been sexting with random women online the entirety of our relationship. I guess to give him some credit, he did confess to me what he says is the whole truth, but it was after I found some evidence that something was up on my own. \n\nI was always very clear with him that my line for cheating was the second someone else was involved, which to me is very clearly the case when seeking out women on the internet. He claims he didn't know I'd be upset. His reasoning for doing it is that it was \"fun\" and he thought it was harmless. I've asked why he didn't mention this to me before if he thought it was harmless and he said he was embarrassed due to the nature of the chats (sounds like hardcore BDSM) and wanted to keep a part of him private.   \n  \nThis all sounds fucking insane to me.   \n  \nHere's what's extra crazy from my point of view: He's been in individual therapy this whole time and a few years back we did 6 months of marriage therapy for issues with sex/intimacy.  At no point did he bring up the secret sex chats. I have no idea what he's doing in therapy that a decade+ doesn't get him to the point of realizing his behavior and changing.  He claims it \"never came up\" and \"didn't seem related\" even when we were literally in marriage therapy for our shitty sex life. \n\nHe just keeps saying he \"never thought about it that way\" but of course claims he can quit cold turkey now that he knows it's a problem. \n\nThis just doesn't make logical sense to me, but I don't know what to do next.

I’m now 20 days post D-Day. She cheated, and I feel like I’ve run through every emotion under the sun. Twice now I’ve sat across from her, looked her in the face, and tried to say, *“I want a divorce.”* Both times I’ve choked. The closest I’ve gotten is, *“I can’t be with somebody like you.”*She breaks down, cries, and shows genuine remorse.\n\n\n\nWe’ve got our first couples therapy session next week, but honestly, my heart isn’t in it. I’ve already done four sessions of individual therapy, which have been helping me process, but the truth is: I don’t want to work on this anymore. I feel guilty because she does. She hurt me, broke me, and I’ve lost complete trust in her. The resentment is overwhelming.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, she’s been trying harder than I’ve ever seen before. More affectionate. Constant updates. Hugging, kissing, telling me she misses me. She’s even asked a couple of times if she could stop by when I’m working just to see me, and I lied, saying I wasn’t around. A month ago, I would have eaten all of that up. I would have loved to do couples therapy. I think it could have transformed us. But now? Too much damage. Too much betrayal. The more she tries, the further I push away. And that kills me because I’ve wanted that stuff for so long, and I do still love her so much. \n\n\n\nIf I could somehow forgive and move past the resentment, maybe there’d be a shot. But what she did, I did not deserve. She disrespected me, disrespected our marriage, and shattered something inside me that I don’t think can be put back together. I haven’t cried like this since I was a kid.\n\nAnd yet, I’m torn. I’ve never been a quitter. I’ve always had the “you’ll have to kill me to stop me” mindset. So pulling the plug feels like failure. I feel guilty knowing I’ll be the one ending our marriage. What if I regret it? What if I can’t forgive myself for walking away?",

      "selftext": "I have my Father's Find My connected to mine and he doesn't know about it because he's not that good with modern technology. I installed it because I've been getting home late nights and traveling often for work and it was supposed to be my safety assurance just in case anything goes wrong. Thankfully, I haven't needed to use it. \n\n  \nLong story short, my dad is retired and my mom is terminally ill and is bedridden. Since I have work, we have a couple private nurses in our home during the day and in the evening who take shifts. However, I noticed my dad has been going out more often which I don't often mind but there was one particular day where I felt that he was lying and my gut told me to check and he was at a hotel nearby our place. I didn't question him but the weeks went by and he would go out more often so I started looking at where he would be. I noticed his location is often at the same house location that I don't know or have any relatives at. I just took screenshots on my phone. \n\n  \nBut today, I had a feeling in my gut again to check his phone and I saw it. He had it hidden with a passcode on one of the texting apps so I couldn't open it but I checked his phone log and saw multiple calls towards this acronym name. I decided to investigate further with his texts the letters didn't come up but when I searched the hotel name from before I saw their message thread. He was cheating with one of my mom's nurses. As far as I'm aware, she's also married and trying to conceive with her husband which is what confuses me. They have these pet names and these conversations. They talk about deleting the conversations as well. I took pictures of all their conversations and have the evidence.\n\n  \nMy dilemma now is if I should confront my dad about it or confront the nurse first. I was thinking of confronting her first to give her the talk to send her resignation and leave quietly on her own accord to save some dignity and I continue to pretend it never happened for the sake of keeping my family together or if I should I tell my family about my father's infidelity. When I was younger, my mom would tell me stories of how my father was fake and has implied that he has cheated before. I know my mom's sickness has been difficult for all of us and he has been supportive and helpful for years now. The only thing keeping me from telling my family about it is knowing that if they knew my father would be immediately cut off and have no access to us kids and my mom and the rest of the family forever. It is already difficult losing one parent which is why i'm hesitant on losing this one too. I'm still young and I just know there's no coming back if our family ever found out. I don't know what to do but I definitely don't want this nurse near my mom again ",

      "selftext": "I (38M) was approached in May by my Wife (40F) of 12 years (this August) with her telling me she feels like we're roommates and had been thinking about divorce because she feels that we are unhappy. This happened after she was planning a road trip with her male friend/coworker for him to buy a car and drive it back across a couple states to where he lives. More to come on that later.\n\nThis came to a complete shock to me, as we had just come back from a trip to see my family in FL and celebrate my nieces birthdays the month before. We had been making plans for the year, and did absolutely everything together. I had no clue she was unhappy in the marriage or our relationship, nor did I ever think she was capable of cheating.\n\nWe started dating in 2005 when I was 18 and she was 20, and have been together ever since. We saw each other almost every weekend and many weekdays for almost 6 years, before moving in with each other in 2011. I worshipped her, this woman was (and still is) everything to me. My entire family (direct and extended) adored her, I had a wonderful relationship with her family, and we did absolutely everything together.\n\nBeginning in 2018/2019, she had been starting to have random medical issues, and several issues with IUDs.   In 2021, her IUD dislodged, and we spent the night in the ER to have it taken care of, where I was traumatized by the setting and an internal ultrasound done somewhat forcibly by an older man that wasn't listening to her and her crying and yelling out of fear and discomfort. That triggered massive anxiety towards hospitals, medical settings, and affected our intimacy. I was always so afraid of hurting her, or reliving those moments in the hospital.  She then suffered a back injury, so was further in pain before and after a back surgery in 2023 (again, triggering my anxiety and worries that I would hurt her of cause immense discomfort).\n\nI spent the last 4 years quietly trying to process my trauma, my depression, my anxious attachment to her, and our sex life suffered as a result. We were only active a couple times a year, and last year she said that it was bothering her when she would spontaneously try to initiate, and I'd panic and freeze. I felt awful, and tried to communicate that it was not her, I was the problem and was trying to figure it out. I tried to be overly affectionate in other ways, constantly initiating physical touch, cuddling, kissing, love notes and bringing shiny pebbles (not really, but just small gifts and mementos). I wanted to talk about my trauma, but I didn't know how to without fear of her taking it as her fault and worrying about that with any medical procedure in the future. I was simply trying to protect her from something I knew was medical, had to be done, but left me sort of broken from a sexual perspective.\n\nCome to this May, she says she thinks she doesn't want to be with me anymore after I told her that her road trip was making me feel uncomfortable and if there was anything she wanted to tell me. I break down crying and try to leave the house because I'm devastated. She holds me back and says she wants me to fight for her. So I do, and over 3 weeks constantly check in on her feelings, what she's thinking, while trying to work through my problems. We make love halfway through and it was absolutely amazing. All the while, I had no clue what was to come.\n\n  \nThen June hits (2 weeks after my birthday, and she tells me she is definitely leaving me, and it's for someone else. Her coworker, someone I know she's been friends with for years and talked with a lot. Turns out, for about 4 years he's been pining for her and telling her that if he had met her 20 years ago, he would have married her instead of his wife. (He's in an open marriage, unhappily he says, with 2 children). And about a year and half ago, she realized she had feelings for him. Then over the last 9 months, started engaging in sexual talk over IG, sending photos of herself, and focusing more and more on him. She tells me she no longer wants to be in our marriage, and starts putting all of her focus into him, which absolutely devastates me. I have a mental breakdown which caused her to see that I took it a lot harder than she thought I was going to.\n\nShe then proceeds to insist we cohabitate, which we did for 2 months. Sharing a bed, her being physically affectionate on and off, while insisting that it changes nothing, she wants to be with him. She learns of my trauma, and is sexually active with me (while not telling him). I start therapy immediately and am put on a list of anti-anxiety, anti-depressants. I'm having panic attacks in the middle of the night, and cry daily. She ignores the crying mostly, and occasionally stepped in to help walk me down from my panic attacks. All the while, not even hiding that she's talking to him on the phone and chatting over IG.\n\nThen came our 20th anniversary 3 weeks ago. She asked if I wanted to do something, to which I couldn't say no. I planned a calm, romantic weekend getaway, revising her old college where we spent a lot of time together and just road tripping around, the two of us in a car, just talking. She was remorseful, she was attentive. She even stopped talking to him for the time we were away. The woman I knew, the girl I grew up with and loved unconditionally was there. We got back, she was still affectionate going into the following week before going on a business trip. Still being somewhat affectionate when she came back.\n\nI had asked her to think about our weekend, and that clearly we still have strong feelings for each other and there's still love there even though she says it's gone. We plan to go to a spa the following weekend to destress, where right before, she says she still chooses him. I'm broken all over again, but immediately soothed when she is visibly upset that I wasn't being affectionate to her at the spa. I of course become affectionate again, and we had a calm relaxing 2 hours. Towards the end, I ask her if we could just for the week, try to be husband and wife and try to just focus on that, she agreed.\n\nThe drive home is wonderful, she's talkative, she's making plans with me for the future, talking about places we could try to go for dinner. Then we get home and she's cold and glued to her phone. I walk away and she gets upset, then disappears for an hour because she had told him we had been physically affectionate and that upset him and she was bothered by that. \n\nShe pushed that she has stronger feelings to him, that she isn't in love with me and that she does not want to be in the marriage and never meant to give me hope. I find out she'd been talking to him much longer than she originally said, and had been sending photos of herself to him since the beginning of this year. We don't sleep at all that night, and she continues in the morning, to the point where I break down crying and can't stop. Ultimately she calls and has me sent to a hospital where it's uncovered and said to me that she's been psychologically and emotionally abusing me, and that she has been triggering the decline of my mental health.\n\nNow, afterwards, she hasn't spoken to me unless through text. We are trying to share time at the house separately but it has not been equal (leaning in her favor, 5 nights to my 2 nights in the house). She removed all mention of our relationship on social media, and unlinked my access to her car and belongings. \n\nI've never felt more abandoned, and replaced... after 20 years together. All I've wanted was to do couples therapy and try to work through things with her, and she has shut me down each time saying that there's nothing that will change her mind, our marriage is dead and she does not want to be with me, she wants to be with him.\n\nLooking for advice on how to cope with all of this. She's going on a trip to see him in 2 weeks, convinced that even though we aren't divorced... it's free game to be with him now. While I wallow in the pain of all of our memories, and the void of the person I love most in the world once was. She insists that she really wants to remain friends, but understands if I'm not capable of that, and is still pushing cohabitation (separate rooms this time) until we figure out what to do with our house.\n\nThe kicker is, if she came back and said she made a mistake... I'd take her back because all I know is her, all I want is her.\n\nThis fucking sucks... My world has crumbled before me and I just don't know how to move forward past this with 20 years of love and memories haunting me day and night.",

I decided to be a friend as best I can, because what they did to me pales in comparison to what she's been through.\n\nI'm really frustrated because she has been going back and forth on wanting to be in a relationship with me again. She talked about trying again, but then she'll talk about how she would have to know a person for a long time before doing anything with them. She'll talk about what she wants and none of it describes me. Then when I ask, she'll say she's not even thinking about relationship at this point. \n\nI get she's going through a lot, but she's the one who brought up us trying again. And now I have to listen to her talk about finding the perfect person. I still have never been in another relationship, have never wanted to be with anyone else, and it destroys me whenever she talks about these things.\n\nI logged on the other day to ask for advice on how to be a good friend, and I ended up reading all my posts from last year. It took me back to such a bad place, and made me just think... how can I possibly still want this person? I shouldn't have read those posts, because I'm really trying to support them, and not make everything about myself. But I can't help but feel really angry in this moment. Being the only person in her entire life to love and support her and I'm still not good enough. Worst part is it wasn't even my idea to say let's try again. She got this in my head and now I can't get it out. I spent a long time to get over her, and the hurt, and I just wanted to be friends. Why did she have to say that. And why did I feel so happy that she did?",

Every time I let her back in, it’s nice for a while then reality sets back in and I realize how this just doesn’t work. it kinda does feel like she’s trying to be different but I can also tell it’s really just a big bandaid over all the mess. Not actual change. Plus, if you can switch up now after all these years, I feel like you knew what you were doing this whole time. We had another conversation not long ago and I was asking some stuff about the cheating and she ended up telling me that for the first year of her cheating, it was bc she was torn between keeping her family together or being with me. Then the rest of the years was “just bc she could get some”. Those were the words she used. It kinda felt like I was finding out she cheated on me all over again bc this whole time I thought she was just stuck on this idea of her family being together but she’s saying that was only for the first year. Idk it’s just so much damage and I just can’t do this. I can literally write a book about all the stuff that’s happened. I can’t feel good about myself staying in this relationship. I’ve been made to feel like I’m not enough in so many ways by her. \n\nSo after a long journey, I’ve decided it’s really time for me to go this time. it’s likely that she will wanna argue and fight with me when I tell her I’m leaving. I know I can get thru that part but it’s the afterwards. All the calling and texting and begging give her a chance and popping up at my house. It’s hard for me to stay strong through all of that. Who knows, maybe she won’t do any of that this time. Maybe she’ll just let me go. But in the case that she doesn’t, what’s your advise on staying strong and not letting her back in? Or just some of your own testimonials about leaving a toxic relationship that was long overdue. ",

I asked ChatGPT to summarize the timeline of my other posts so I don’t have to write it all out again and it’s pasted below.

He feels like he needs more effort from me now that he is a year sober and stable I need to refocus on our marraige. \nHe wants me to give up some of my dog sports and equipment to repair our relationship.\nI feel like I’ve finally come alive—and he wants to pull me back in.\n\nAll in all I have potentially settled on divorce. I have yet to pull the trigger. I’m scared shitless and terrified choosing to divorce him will ruin me professionally, socially, and financially. ",

      "title": "Serial online cheating, is this salvageable?",
      "selftext": "Hi, my ex fiance serially cheated on me online, verging on intention to cheat physically and slight emotional cheating. \n\nWe met and dated online for 4 years. He'd come to my city to visit me several times a year until I moved in. We lived together for a year, and he proposed to me on our 5 year anniversary. 3 months later, I woke up in bed to catch him cheating on me by sexting other women. He had an active porn addiction the entire relationship and had cheated chronically since we got together.\n\nIt gradually progressed over the years from porn to sexting people nudes on discord, paying for onlyfans, paying to use omegle sex sites, and VRChat roleplay sex with others. The worst thing he did was pay a girl on discord who lived near him with intention to meet up (he bailed last second), and sexting people from local city FWB subreddits with intention to meet up (also bailed on this), a year apart from each instance. As for VRChat, he ran a sexual discord community that hosted sex fests together for 2 months and developed friendships and a \"minor crush\" on some people. He did most cheating things with enough distance apart that he'd get guilty and delete accounts, then eventually try something similar again a few months/a year later. When I caught him recently, he had spoken to one girl for a week and was developing a crush on her, even having told her \"I love you as a friend.\" He had just finished his largest cheating spree in one run within the last month of our relationship, where he had sexted 30+ women on discord, including the girl he was becoming friends with and starting to like. At this time in life, he had lost his 3rd job in a row in a single year (not due to performance) and was regularly having panic attacks, and our relationship was rockier than usual.\n\nThis was not the first time he cheated. The first time was 6 months into our relationship, and he kept it a secret until our 2 year mark. He had sexted 1 girl. I forgave him and thought he changed, because he acted like he was extremely repulsed by porn and genuinely seemed extremely attracted to me the entire relationship. I also forgave him since we were a lot younger when we first met and I didn't take the relationship as seriously either, so it felt like fair game. He openly used porn the first year of our relationship until I argued with him to stop, so I fucked up not taking that red flag seriously due to being naive and much younger.\n\nOverall, he had major red flags the whole relationship with what seems to be a severe avoidant attachment style, where he wants closeness but gets panicky about his independence when he gets too close to me/major life stressors occur. He has severe self esteem and shame problems where he's afraid of rejection. He claims he would try to stop the porn and cheating occasionally due to guilt, usually at best stopping for a few months, only again to use it every few weeks. He says he has a sex addiction and that he never felt like he could get help and didn't know what to do. He says the moments me and him were closest, he didn't use porn or cheat, but he always was scared when I got too close that he would accidentally spill the truth. I always poured more into the relationship than him and felt unappreciated, but I never called it out firmly enough because I was scared he'd admit lack of interest in me and I was honestly a bit traumatized from the first time he cheated to heavily question him about our inconsistent sex life (when we did it, it was genuinely good, but it was weirdly infrequent for his high libido). I eventually accepted he was just \"like that.\" Now I see the hot and cold withdrawls to affection cycle lined up with his cheating and overall life stress. He says he was exposed at porn at 10 years old and never learned any other coping mechanisms for his stress. Not having any coping skills was a red flag I noticed and called out pretty frequently before we broke up.\n\nHe says he genuinely views the things he did with others as porn in the moment, fully using them as objects and ghosting people whenever he got nudes or finished. Even for the people he became friends with, he said he saw it as a game and only liked people because they boosted his egos or would charm them for nudes, he can't name a single thing he liked about their personalities. As for the meetups, he said he wanted to do it in the moment but ultimately got scared he'd get caught. He says he compartmentalized, justified, suppressed emotions, and completely split himself over this, hence why he seemed like he could manage to be romantic and close with me over the years. He also has always shown genuine attraction to me and has liked my personality, in his brain the selfish sex addiction side was different from his caring side, and he felt like it was more like self harm than genuine enjoyment. To be clear, neither me nor him are saying the sex addiction made him do it. He decided to do it, it was a choice regardless of what influenced the choice, and I'm treating it as such.\n\nIt's been 2\\~ weeks since dday. I told him that love is not just a feeling, but a selfless choice you make for another, and trust is when two people take that mutual risk. After discussing it a lot, he finally admits he likely never truly loved me in that way since he couldn't manage to have real intimacy with me or put me above his selfish desires, but that he genuinely desperately always wanted to. I do believe he wanted to in our relationship, as he always did get ALMOST to the point of full confession looking back at it. He's shown true remorse and has disclosed horribly hurtful things I never would have found out about, even though it took me initially confronting him for him to be honest. I don't think he's lying anymore, but I feel like I fell in love with his mask and don't know who he is. Once I pointed out how avoidant he's been, it seemed to wake something up inside of him and he's been acting very differently. He also has signed himself up for his own CSAT, researching things, and started attending SAA groups.\n\nI lean on just fully giving up on him, his cheating was for so egregiously long and involved so many people (even if it was all online) that I can't imagine how I could stomach trusting him again. But at the same time, I think his issues are fixable if he can accept the core concept of full remorse and empathy forever onward, including fixing all the other issues involved like sex addiction or avoidance. Obviously he hasn't been empathetic towards me, even if it's \"because of trauma,\" I don't deserve that and it makes him a super dangerous partner. But, he has started showing empathy now and I do somewhat believe he always wanted to be better the entire relationship. This isn't me just coping, I am hurt and do want us to have a relationship deep down, but it's more so me trying to logically figure out if someone like him is capable of change or being in a relationship with again someday on principle. I spent a long time with me and we were about to get married.\n\nThoughts on my situation? Maybe insight onto him or next steps in either direction? Please more nuance than \"just dump him,\" I want to hear what the other side would argue.",

      "title": "My fiancé had a 5yr affair out of the 6 1/2yrs together - long post",
      "selftext": "I’m so lost on what to do next. Everything is so overwhelming and complicated. We are in year 7 together now. 3 kids, two dogs and a cat. A whole life together. We met in middle school and shared our first kiss behind the band room. Years separated us as we got older. I married someone else but divorced and a year later we found each other online again. Instant connection. \n\nFirst few months were extraordinary. Until he OD in my kitchen floor. He went into a program and I supported him through that but it was really traumatic for me. Once he was out we decided to move out of that city and start new and fresh together. 4 months after the move, I started having some peculiar symptoms. I sought out a neurologist and they did tests and said I was fine. My behavior was inconsistent and irrational. We fought a lot because id catch him in stupid lies. Wasn’t even anything interesting to lie about. But coupling that with my irrationality, I kept breaking up with him. His ‘final straw’ led him to cheat. We were still living together. Still having sex. But this is where it all began and one of the reasons he’d eventually give me for starting the affair. \n\nA few days later we made up and that night I had 3 seizures for the first time in my life. Turns out all those emotional and irrational behaviors were symptoms of a seizure disorder and I was later diagnosed with epilepsy. From there things got harder but manageable. We even decided to start trying for another baby. So we did.. spent months trying to conceive and finally did. We were so happy. \n\nBut he had an uncomfortable relationship with a woman he worked with. I found messages on his phone where they’d talk all the time, sometimes about me and our relationship. It really hurt me. I told him this and he was more upset I invaded his privacy. Eventually their relationship made me really uncomfortable and I suggested he switch jobs, so he did. I thought things were getting better. \n\nThe pregnancy was difficult and I ended up having an emergency csection. There were many complications from the seizures and they didn’t think I would survive. But I did and we had a beautiful baby. Though we had countless sleepless nights, we supported each other and things felt better. He even proposed and we started planning our wedding. \n\nMonths after delivery, I used his phone to cashapp myself and saw where he requested money from the same woman with a caption that said “for dat booty.” I was livid. He had quit that job with her. Why were they still talking? Why was she sending him money? He made up some lame lie and I was too tired to investigate further so I tried to let it go. \n\nOver the next year I began to get wary about his phone. At this point we were on year 3. He switched jobs again and we ended up moving cities. Thought I could finally put her behind us. But my anxiety grew stronger and stronger about his phone. So one night I decided to go through it while he was sleeping. I found out that he hired her at the restaurant he was a GM for… what?? He told me he needed an assistant GM and knew she’d do a good job. Gave a speal about her being a single mother and needed a job.. but her husband, yes they’re still married, makes over 6 figures and has a couple businesses. Why on earth would she need to work a little fast food job 45 minutes away from her house when she had more than enough support from her husband and his family?? Worst part is, the same month we moved out of that town, he hired her. \n\nAmidst this new discovery, the wedding was still being planned. He picked the venue, colors, table settings.. you name it. I didn’t care about any of that. I just wanted to be married to him. But I always felt inadequate. We didn’t have sex nearly as often as we did in the beginning. He always told me I just had a much stronger sex drive and that he just didn’t want it as often. Other than the phone and lack of sexual interest, we didn’t fight about anything else. But after I found out he hired her, I couldn’t let it go. I dug deeper. \n\nBy year 4 he called off the wedding and we broke up but still lived together. Still went on trips. Still had sex. Playing house under the illusion of being broken up.. At that point, the seizure condition spiraled and the seizures became debilitating. I lost everything. My job, license, car, independence, our potential marriage.. I was crushed in every single way imaginable. The phone became the center of attention next to the seizures. I found out he hid her name as something else in his phone even though I knew she worked there. But he swore it was just a working relationship and they were friends. Outside of that I was making issues that didn’t exist. \n\nBut one day I walked in on him texting her and the message said “I wish I could take all your pain away.” I was yet again destroyed. Nothing had changed between us other than the title of relationship. We did everything together. We indulged in each others hobbies. Went on family vacations. Celebrated every holiday and birthday together. Nothing changed. Outside of the phone issue and my growing insecurity and anxiety, things were going well. After seeing that message I knew they were far from just friends or coworkers. That, that was love. \n\nI confronted him. Told him that I knew better and you don’t say that to an employee because they are in pain and recovering from surgery. He threw a huge fit and convinced me I was yet again going out of my way to look for problems. A reason for us to not be together. I told him that if he had any hopes of us working out he’d have to fire her. She’d been working with him for two years and I couldn’t bare it any longer. He refused. Then, my mom died. \n\nThe grief spread through me and took over. I’d put the other woman on the back burner and struggled to manage. The seizures became violent and relentless. I ended up qualifying for disability and got better insurance that covered different meds to help manage them. All the while, he was so supportive. \n\nMy mom struggled mentally and ended up becoming quite the hoarder. I hadn’t been to her house in years and had no idea. She used to be a jeweler and had all sorts of jewelry and equipment at her house. I did my best to collect everything but with my health and the condition of her home, being there exasperated the seizures and I struggled to get things cleaned up. After she passed, he became so wonderful. Helping me with cleaning her house, getting my mom’s crazy ex out of her house, helping with the seizures and grief. I genuinely felt like he’d changed and cared. \n\nAt this point we were on year 5 and things were just hard all around. The anxiety was crippling. Seizures were debilitating. Grief smothered me. Every day was difficult. He ended up getting a promotion and we celebrated. The next day they took that promotion away and he was more than pissed and hurt. \n\nHe got a call from an old supervisor asking if he was interested in a different job, but it was states away. We drove there the next day and he took a tour and negotiated salary, etc. despite leaving my family and support system behind, I was so excited to live in a different state and truly start over. A state where she didn’t live. A job she didn’t work at. Miles apart with no access to each other. \n\nIn ten days we were fully moved and settled into a new house in the new state. He started his new job and things were great for the most part. The day we moved I asked him to be my boyfriend again. We could work on the rest. I just wanted him and he had always taken such great care of the kids and I. What ever friendship they had would be behind us and only the future would exist. So we moved. \n\nI have two children from my previous marriage and legally I had to obtain an attorney to file all sorts of paper work to move the kids across states. A whopping $13K to move here. I spent all of my savings, cashed out my 401K from my previous career before the seizures. It all seemed worth it to get a fresh start. So I did. \n\nA month later, I felt that same anxiety feeling about his phone come bubbling up. So again I took his phone and took a pic of her contact information. Looked through the phone and nothing. So I moved on. But he became even more distant. I asked him if he was grieving the life he had in the old state and asked if he missed “his friend.” He said he hated her and all the issues they caused our relationship. Always denying anything physical even still. So I tried to fight the gut feelings.\n\nLiving in a new state meant new doctors, insurance, tests, etc. the new neurologist needed new scans and an extended EEG which they let me do at home. Withdrawing from medication, I had two seizures captured on the study and was hopeful this study helped the new neurologist gain better control of the seizures. Again, unmedicated meant I was having all those same irrational behaviors and issues. Which he was aware of would happen. \n\nA day after the study he broke up with me. One day after two unmedicated seizures, a week before my mom’s one year death anniversary and two weeks before Christmas. Saying I was devastated doesn’t even begin to cover the emotions I had. I’ll admit I had been difficult that day about making the choice to go to Walmart. But those symptoms happen and I lose control over it. It was a stupid fight about going to the store. That was it. It clearly didn’t settle well and I resorted to begging. Nothing. \n\nThe next day I happened to get a text saying our phone bill was ready to view. I have never looked at the bill fully before and didn’t realize I had access to all the numbers, dates and times of every call and text. But something told me to  open it and when I did, he had a few recurring numbers with area codes from our previous state. Instantly I looked at the photo I took of her contact info and the number didn’t match. I was relieved. But what were these new numbers? I ruled a few out after some quick searches and there was one left. So I paid to have it searched. Guess who it was?! Her. \n\nCountless messages and extended phone calls over the past month and a half. I broke that day. Called him and confronted him. He told me saved her number under a different name again and the number under he name wasn’t even hers. Told me that he loved her and always struggled to do the right thing. Again said they’d never been physical and that he tried to avoid his feelings because it felt wrong. That he loved me and knew I needed him and the seizures and the kids and the doctors and all the things. But after moving here he realized she was the love of his life and he missed her. \n\nFuck. Who was I to stand in the way of true love? Didn’t matter how much it killed me. I loved him and would have done anything to make him happy. Did everything I could over the years to make him happy. It was never enough. Facts were he didn’t want me. \n\nNext thing I knew he was planning a trip back home to spend time with her. I asked him if the kids and I could get a ride to visit family for Christmas. We would stay with my family and he could go spend time with her. She was pissed but he loved that idea and getting to spend Christmas together. \n\nA week had passed and we changed. We began having more sex than we have ever had. It was passionate and loving and well I’ll be honest. I knew he’d go to her and I’d never share this sort of passion ever again. So selfishly I endulged. \n\nThe day we were leaving he had me pack his bag and we got in the car and drove 11 hours back to our home state. We stayed in a bnb and celebrated Christmas together. Then he had me drop him off to her work and hand deliver him to another woman. I told him if he got out of the car, there would be no looking back. He said he loved her. We shared one last long passionate kiss and he was gone. The pain I felt that day. I was sick. I was broken. But I loved him and truly just wanted him happy. \n\nDays later i couldn’t handle it anymore and wanted to cut our stay a day short. He went ballistic. Told me they hadn’t even had sex yet and I was trying to sabotage things between them. I just wanted to go home. I was grieving my mother. Grieving our relationship. Dreading moving out and back home. I’d spent everything I had moving to the new state. I had nothing. No where to go. No help. No job. Epilepsy. I was anxious to get home and start figuring my next steps out. \n\nAfter a huge argument and him moving all the money out of our shared bank account so I couldn’t leave we agreed we’d leave late after noon the next day. I left my families house early that morning to take the kids to our favorite park and spend the day there. An hour into the drive it began to rain. I had no money and the only option was to sit in front of her apartment for a couple hours until he was ready to leave. \n\nAbout 30 minutes after waiting he texted and asked what time I was coming. I told him about leaving early and the park and the rain and that we were already at her house. To my surprise he seemed relieved I was already there. He said he’d be right out and did. \n\nMoments after getting in the car, he began to break. Told me how he didn’t want to be with her and made a huge mistake. They “finally” had sex and it was awkward and just wasn’t like it was with us. Told me how she didn’t share the same hobbies, music and was overall uninteresting in a relationship setting. Told me he’d not seen this side of her because they always had a work relationship and friendship. I reminded him that I was serious when I said if he got out of the car there’d be no turning back. \n\nWhat was I supposed to do? He told our kids he was moving back and loved someone else. Had us start packing so he could move in immediately. Broke me beyond repair just to go and finally have sex with her and realize it was only unfulfilling lust and not love. \n\nWell, He broke it off with her and she was livid. The first night he was there she had him meet all of her family and paraded around her new boyfriend and how they finally got to be together. Clearly she was humiliated by his rejection and wanted to hurt him. \n\nSo, she messaged me and spilled the beans. Provided years worth of messages and explained how the affair began shortly after the initial seizure symptoms began. She really thought she did something by telling me. Thought we had something in common to be angry about. What she didn’t realize is I didn’t connect with her. She didn’t understand how he could do this to her. Umm hello, you got a front row seat to him cheating, lying, spending an hour in her bed and then coming home and playing house with me. \n\nShe was there while we were trying for a baby. Becoming engaged. Overcoming financial and medical obstacles, moves, vacations.. a whole life with me while she got crumbs, broken promises and a full view of who he truly was. Did she really think he was the perfect man for her? For anyone? A man who never fully chose her and when he did, he hated it. Always going back home to the “wife and kids.” \n\nWhat kind of woman does that? She knew about the seizures. Knew we had a child together and my other two saw him as daddy.  Knew he was the financial support. And yet, she was still able to allow herself to fuck him? We had nothing in common. A taken man would never hold my interest. Why would I want someone who would never chose me? Leave my bed and go back home to the life he shared with another woman. One with disabilities. Let alone a family with three children. \n\nI was not the same. We shared nothing. I told him I knew everything and all that he’d done over the years. Things were beyond repair. I was forever changed and no longer believed in love, truth or him. The man I saw in my own mind was merely a figment of my imagination. Some deluded shell of a man I created to over look years of controlling, gaslighting, mental abuse and betrayal. Everything that once was became a lie. The more we spoke the more lies were uncovered and truth began to spread like wild fires. \n\nI tried to get past it. We went to couples therapy. Planned dates for each other. Continued to live life cohesively with the kids. I gave it all the effort I could. Until I found out the reason he’d been so willing to go to my mom’s house to clean. He used it as his own personal treasure chest. Selling any jewelry he found and taking equipment and things from her house. He stole from my dead mother. Stole from me really. All the while saw me drowning in grief while he took thousands of dollars of jewelry. \n\nAt that point, I began to truly disconnect and start grieving the relationship. There was no future. No hope. No room or belief of change. It was over. It is over. But now what? It’s been 9 months since this all unfolded and I still have nothing. \n\nMy father stopped communicating with me because of the whole ordeal. Not sure how it is that my fiancé has a 5 year affair, willing and ready to abandon the kids and I, breaking my heart.. means I lose my father as well because I couldn’t just forgive my fiancé. The fuck? So here I am now. Alone in a shared home with my abuser and our children. No savings, no friends, bo family, no job, no support system, financially dependent on him. \n\nThe isolation is unbearable at this point. But in this economy and with epilepsy, I couldn’t support 3 children on my own. My exhusband is an absent father and has struggled to pay child support consistently. When we moved I arranged a decrease in child support because my fiancé always took care of us. My exhusbands main excuse to not seeing the kids was due to the financial strain child support was puttin on him. He racked up 90K in back pay and was struggling to keep a job because of the state enforcements for child support. \n\nSo I decided to get rid of the back pay and lower the support by half in effort to facilitate some sort of relationship between him and the kids. Little did I know I’d be completely fucking myself of potential support. All for him to let me spend all of my savings, decrease support payments and move me states away from any family and potential support. \n\nThe kids and I started a new life here. New doctors that have really helped with the seizures, my children have started activities and made friends. It would be impossible for me to move back alone. Let alone the financial restraint. And with my father abandoning me, my mother dead, I wouldn’t really have the kind of support I’d need anyway. \n\nNot to mention most of my seizures are nocturnal. I typically have them within the first hour of falling asleep. I have sleep apnea as well so I wear a mask when I sleep. Countless times I’ve had seizures in my sleep and start aspirating on fluids the mask was trapping in. Had it not been for my fiancés quick action getting the mask off, clearing my air ways and rolling me on my side, I’d be dead. \n\nHow am I supposed to move into my own place knowing the risk of me dying in my sleep is inevitable and no one would be there to save me. So I ask. What now? What the fuck now? Stay in misery, agony and constant suffering just to have financial security and someone to sleep next to at night to save me when my body betrays me as well?\n\n I have nothing. Feel nothing but loss and each day is just as hard as it was 9 months ago when I found everything out. I’ve lost 70lbs. Don’t sleep. Have really violent seizures when I do sleep and while awake now from the lack of sleep, stress and fatigue. \n\nI am decaying loudly while my children are unaware, happy even. Well taken care of and without nothing. If you saw us in front of our children you’d have no idea just how broken we truly are. We are excellent coparents and the kids are the sole priority. Alone, I have nothing to offer them accept adversity, seclusion, financial strain, the burden of a disabled mother and love. \n\nI lie awake each night sick knowing what he’s done. He chose this. Every time he left our home for her bed, he knew what it would do to me. To the kids. Shit to the animals, ha. He knew and yet he still chose. So now what? Now fucking what? ",

Saved my intake form from the marriage counselor I was trying to talk to about the weird shit good on 2 days before I finally found out what I had known for months. And then I continued to write. Like a lot. And now I get to see how far I’ve come. Even in 38 days. And it brings me a lot of joy. Because I’m so much better than I was. Still lost. Still hurt. But less so.  And coming stronger than I ever would have known I could be.\n\nI met the AP. Forgave him. Talked to him a couple times after even. Trying to make sure he doesn’t hurt himself with drugs or alcohol. Because he’s fucking in it. And I feel bad for him. Forgiveness is having the grace to give those that hurt you your honest best wishes to heal, unfuck themselves and make the best of the the life that they’re still living. It’s not over. It’s just different. Do better. Be better.\n\nAnd the same for her. Find some peace through the tumult. The turmoil and the tinfoil. Be better. Get better. You’ve got a lot of life to live. Just not with me. 16 years is a lot to throw away. Ive got gratitude for what I got. Like she died that day without leaving this mortal coil.\nSo I move on. And I find peace. And happiness. And strength. And sobriety - and that’s an important one.\n\nIt’s important to process and feel this shit. Not mask it or cover it up. Your problems will still be there when you wake up no matter if you fall asleep at the bottom of the bottle or not. If you’re in the shit - feel it. Make it make you a better person. Build back stronger and with a renewed sense of purpose and love because you love yourself more than you thought you did. And someday someone really fucking lucky is going to get to experience that and your new, deeper zest and passion for life will make that so much more fulfilling than whatever it was that that unfortunate soul who left will never get to feel.\n\nAnd write about something daily. And go back and read it. Because it’s cool as fuck to see your strength in your weakest moments. If you need help, hmu. Im happy to lend an ear to anyone in this community because I have so much compassion for those of us that have been through it. Everything is right. Just hold tight.",

      "title": "What is wrong with me?",
      "selftext": "Discovered last night that my husband has been having an emotional affair for 3 years with his coworker. He insists that he would never sleep with her and isn’t attracted to her in that sense, but they have shared very explicit stories and he has turned to her for emotional support for years now. \n\nI have approached him so many times out of loving concern for his mental health and our relationship because he has been distant for years but he has assured me every time that I’m looking into it too much, and that everything is fine and he’s stressed, but happy with us and our communication. \n\nLast year he accidentally sent me a text that was meant for her and unsent it - I didn’t even know it was a thing, and if we’ve ever sent the wrong text to each other in our 15 years together we’ve laughed it off. So when he unsent it and I didn’t see what it was, I asked who it was for (I saw a love heart emoji so it definitely struck me as suss) and he said it was to his coworker who talks to him for support because she’s going through a difficult time with her husband while she was going through IVF and her then pregnancy - mind you, he had told me for years and years that he couldn’t stand her and she pissed him off. He’s never had female friends, and given his previous comments about her I was stunned. He assured me they don’t talk much and that it was just about her stuff and that we were all good. I struggled to let it go and so instead of hounding him or making unfounded accusations, I went to see my psychologist because I assumed my gut instinct was off. I spent hundreds and hundreds rewiring my thought process. \n\nWhen I first found out they were talking I wrote a poem to get it off my chest and process it. A few months later when she had been on mat leave for a while (this January) I showed it to him because I was proud of it as a work of poetry and it was a way of showing him what I had worked really hard to overcome for our relationship. He said that it was an amazing piece of writing and it crushed him and that he was so sorry that I felt that way, and that I truly had nothing to worry about - he promised me. \n\nI had some dodgy transactions on our Apple account yesterday - AI girlfriends at $23 a week… when I established that it wasn’t our teen son I asked to see his phone which I haven’t done in our 15 years. I was pissed off and feeling bitter so I went to check his and her messages while he was there next to me, watching me check. He said that he didn’t appreciate me checking his messages (boy, I wonder why) and by the time I had finished reading the texts and IG messages it was pretty clear that he had definite feelings for her and that I was not his best friend… There was a lot of flirting, him making sexual remarks and complaining that he doesn’t get laid enough, discussion about his sexual desires that I hadn’t even been told of. She’s married and has a kid and she sent a lot of suspect memes and inappropriate things but she made it clear that she loved him as a friend and nothing more and that’s the only reason I don’t think they have had sex. I couldn’t see any explicit images of each other, but he had also deleted all texts prior to when he accidentally sent me the wrong text last year - he went out of his way to hide what they had. They sent each other lots of cutesy best friend memes as well as the sexy/flirty/cheeky ones. \n\nI also need to say that I am chronically ill. I have a pain disorder and arthritic joints, I have chronic migraines and fatigue. But I know that we need sexual intimacy and that I feel bad that we don’t have sex like we used to because of my illness. I have spoken to him about how I feel sorry and I have bought lingerie and toys to spice things up, so I thought he would see that I’m putting in extra effort. I made a conscious effort to try and not stretch it further than 3 weeks between sex, with some sort of act in between too. But reading his chat with her, is the first time I’ve seen that he’s not happy. He said that with the lack of intimacy I give him and the way I’m sick and go to bed early, he doesn’t want a life of celibacy but wouldn’t push me or put pressure on, but also feels like a single dad. I’m floored. I have opened up the channels for open communication, I’ve told him that he can tell me anything without judgment for years and that we would just work through whatever might be going on because we’re a team and best friends. \n\nDespite all my pain and the stress in our lives we have always said that we have great communication and we’re both so proud of that. There’s not a lot of stuff in my life that brings joy when I am in constant pain and discomfort, but the strength of our relationship was one, and our kids are the other. Now I find out from him that he didn’t want to open up to me and instead chose to continue to have this dependency on her even though I offered to sit and listen without judgment so I could help him. But he insisted that it was ME looking into things too much and that he was absolutely fine albeit stressed, but we were solid as ever…\n\nNow to today - I was so hurt and shocked that somehow he had these kinks that he’s never told me (and I’ve asked him what his kinks are because I’m keen to explore) but he’s told her about. I wanted to know what they were. He’s telling me and it’s all stuff we’ve done before! and for some stupid reason, it has turned me on so much to know that he loves this same shit that I made clear that I loved at the time. \n\nBut he has absolutely broken my heart. I’ve never been so hurt in my life because he has lied to me and convinced me that my concerns were in my head, when my gut was correct all along. \n\nHow can I be so turned on by what he is saying after he has broken me? He has been awful and deceiving and I’m so mad and hurt and feel betrayed. But it’s such a cruel joke that if he had just told me what he wanted at the beginning years ago, that he wanted more intimacy, instead of seeking attention from the other woman, we wouldn’t be in this situation. It took me discovering years of emotional infidelity to work out what has been his problem all along and I’m turned on by what he should have told me in the first place but I also don’t even know if I can move on from what has happened? He’s had feelings for this woman which started because he couldn’t tell me what he wanted - but he could tell her and that appealed to him. \n\nI’m so thrown and confused. What’s wrong with me? Ugh.",

      "title": "Not sure how to move forward",
      "selftext": "Well where to begin.. \n\nSo I'm pretty new to Reddit, I recently discovered my partner of 6 years has never been faithful. \n\nWe have two children who are very young. I caught him in a lie a couple of weeks ago and he has drip fed me information since to come clean. \n\nBasically since we have been together he has been an active user of internet chat, Reddit (nsfw), dating profiles, escorts, only fans etc. he has been actively trying to find people to be sexual with online through posting dick pics on nsfw pages asking for takers. He has 2 women he has been in active affairs with for over a year that are also married, he found them in a seeking affairs group on KIK. He has been involved in people remotely controling sex toys and also sexting/ cyber sex for many years. \n\nTo make things more complicated, he is extremely emotionally volatile and has aggressive outbursts at our children, even as little babies. He his this behaviour from me until late in my first pregnancy when he became increasingly aggressive towards me. He perceives everything I say and do as an attack towards him, he has huge mood changes in a split second and goes between love bombing, depression and sulking every 48 hrs. \n\nI haven't left before now, but have challenged him about this behaviour and have tried to be supportive and have got him help to resolve the behaviour as I love him (or am trauma bonded). \n\nSince his recent disclosure it has also come to light he has spent all of our family income and has huge debts but he won't tell me what he has been spending on or show many any accounts. He completely controlls out finances. I know he has used hotels, escorts and porn subscription services though so I am confident he was spending lots on this. \n\nRecently he had one of the women in our house while our babies were asleep and I was away. He told me he regularly has had her in our home while I've been at work, he works from home. The 2 women he is involved with are both married and one of them was pregnant when they started seeing each other, she had a baby in feb. He didn't know their real names at the time but has since found them on social media and given me their profiles. I can see their spouses and would like to contact them to let them know once I no longer live where I am - they know my location. \n\nThroughout our relationship we have had a very active sex life and I did think he was a little conservative. I have since been told he not only has affairs, he has participated in a group sex act with the new mother he was cheating with and 2 other men. He doesn't wear protection and I have had testing to make sure I am ok. When we first met we could have slept together on our first date and he declined, saying he didn't want it to just be sex with me, he wanted more. He told me he loved me every day. He would regularly send flowers, cards and cute things for no reason.\n\nNow, he is identifing as a sex addict, but his cheating behaviour started long ago, before it became an addiction. I appreciate it may be an addiction now, but it didn't start this way. He told me he has had many ongoing online affairs with women. \n\nHe has agreed to stay away from our children till he has had a full psychiatric evaluation and completes a men's behaviour change program. He is particularly aggressive to our little boy, constantly yelling at him. His psychologist believes he may have borderline personality disorder or narcissism. \n\nI am replaying every moment. I have already found so many posts online of him actively trying to cheat that go back to before we had kids. \n\nHe tells me he is sorry, he says he has a problem and he regrets everything. I can't seem to connect the person he was to me to the facts he has admitted to and for some reason I just really miss him and I'm not sure I couldn't get through this with him, but know ultimately it would always impact us. I also know he was very abusive and I am so confused why I would have time for him still or love for him. \n\nI was so happy and committed to him despite the challenges we have had, I feel like an idiot. \n\nWe are fully broken up, but I find myself wanting to see him and being kind and understanding, not angry - but then I feel so sad about what he has done, so rejected and even victimised. \n\nWhat do I do, what do you think, what would you do? \n\nWe can never be together again because I wouldn't ever trust him again and my family have said they will never accept the relationship again. \n\nI feel like I've lost everything, but how do you loose what you know you never truly had? I feel really messed up in my head, like I'm in a cult or something and I am brainwashed. \n\nHow do I break the trauma bond? Give me all the tips.. ",

Then a few years into the relationship (I don’t even remember when it was, I just know it happened) I found out that he was still doing the same things - hiring escorts. I was heartbroken, and I felt sick to my stomach that he was hiring these women who were addicted to drugs and using them for his own benefit. I just felt so betrayed. I love this man and I’ve never been so close to anyone in my life. This is why I felt that we could reconcile and move past it. He promised me and swore that this would never happen again. Fast forward to last year - I had a gut feeling and I just knew it happened again. Once again we decided to reconcile. I’m a glutton for punishment, I know. We both got pretty heavy into THC at this time and I don’t remember much from then either. I just know that once I found out my usage increased immensely. Two days ago I decided to quit cold turkey. Now here I am - reliving every terrible feeling I’ve ever felt and feeling like I am just waiting for the other shoe to drop. I still love him. He’s my best friend. I just feel like I am doing myself such a disservice but I’m hopeful that he has changed. I don’t really need anything from anyone here I guess, I just needed to get this out as I don’t really talk about these things with anyone. I know that he is a good man, with a lot of baggage and he didn’t have a great life. Neither did I. But now I find myself with a wandering eye too. I feel like we are so far apart from one another and I just don’t know if I can ever get over this. ",

      "selftext": "I recently found out that my partner who I have been with since October 2023 cheated on me with a work colleague last November. Our relationship wasn't great at the time with lots of arguments so he & this work colleague started to flirt briefly which led to him taking her back to our house where they kissed, she got undressed from the waist up but apparently, it didn't go any further because guilt kicked in for him & he got super uncomfortable. He says this happened as he was lacking the attention at home & had a weak moment. We all work together in the same office and they sit next to each other behind me so this means, that this was happening right in front of me. \nI haven't left him because our relationship improved massively in the last few months and we were in a really good place and have bought a house together. I also haven't left him because it was just kissing and nothing else plus it happened when we weren't in a good place. \nI am now struggling to process this and move on. Working with her is a constant reminder. They obviously don't sit next to each other anymore. Any advice welcome 💛\n",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m looking for advice and perspective on forgiveness and rebuilding trust after a situation with my boyfriend.\n\nMy boyfriend and I are in a committed relationship. Recently, I found out he was entertaining another girl — not sex, but taking/saving pictures and having interactions that felt like betrayal. To me, this wasn’t “full-on cheating,” but it was still crossing a line and it hurt deeply.\n\nWe’ve talked about it, and he admitted it was wrong, apologized, and seems to understand the impact it had on me. He’s been showing remorse and trying to be more present, and I feel like we’re slowly moving forward.\n\nSince then, we’ve had some really positive moments. For example:\n\t•\tWe’ve been joking, playing Monopoly, and hanging out like normal, though we agreed to cut back on certain jokes about what happened.\n\t•\tI’ve been taking things day by day — like deciding when to be physically close again, and reminding myself that forgiveness is a process.\n\t•\tWe even had a moment recently where it felt like we were “playing house,” cooking together and being alone at his place. It felt natural and right.\n\nStill, I sometimes feel anxious, especially when I think about being around friends. I worry about what will happen if a conversation about cheating comes up or if we see something about it on social media. I don’t want to spiral or feel triggered, but I also don’t want to brush my feelings under the rug.\n\nSo I guess my questions are:\n\t1.\tHow do you forgive and move forward when the betrayal wasn’t physical, but still hurt?\n\t2.\tHow do you handle being reminded of it (through friends, media, or social situations) without it ruining the progress you’re making?\n\t3.\tFor those who’ve forgiven something like this, how did you rebuild trust and feel secure again?\n\nThanks for reading — I’m just trying to move at my own pace, be honest with myself, and not rush the process.",

      "title": "Why can I not shake the fact that I feel like my boyfriend is cheating on me ?",
      "selftext": "My boyfriend and I have been together for almost a year now, and for some reason I have a weird feeling that he’s cheating on me. I have never felt this way before about any of my other partners/ romantic interests, but for him I kinda feel it all the time. (i’m going to try and break up my points to make it less long lol)\n\nFirst of all, he has told me he cheated in the past on his old girlfriend but he would never cheat on me and that if anyone is going to cheat in the relationship its going to be me. That right there is my first red flag, because WHY would you even say that. \n\nSecond, I caught him texting one of his exs. Basically I wouldn’t have cared if he told me about it, BUT, he only told me after I asked him why someone else had passed me on his snap bsf list, and when I checked he had her notifications silenced on snap and when I asked why he said “bc she always is blowing me up”. And then on top of that we were supposed to go somewhere together, but I couldn’t go bc I had work, so he went without me, which idc about, but then he told me one night while he was somewhat tipsy that SHE was supposed to go but ended up not going bc she slept too late. We had this conversation like a week after he went, never told me this girl was supposed to go before even when I asked who he was going with.\n\nThird, he always brings up his exs/ people he has slept with and seems to sexualize other women right in front of me. He likes to bring up the fact he used to sleep around a lot all the time and likes to occasionally talk about how nice women’s body’s are to me. I understand you can learn from your past and move on, but is it moving on if you are constantly talking about it ? also i just find it disrespectful to bring up that kind of stuff to your gf. Like anytime I say anything about a male celebrity i find attractive he’s like “oh so ur going to leave me for him” or “so if you had the chance to sleep with him would you” after he literally just told me about how some random chick gave him head in the parking lot we were sitting in. He also told me he’s “what women want” and seems to think he’s peak male and every women would get with him if he wanted.\n\nLast reason, he seems to lie a lot . I have caught him in them and just never said anything. For example, when it was his exs birthday he was saying how she was like blowing him up for not coming to her party. And ik i shouldn’t have done it but i got curious and looked at his messages, HE literally texted HER happy birthday and all she said was thanks and left him on read after that. Also when it was his birthday he literally said “wow she didn’t even tell me happy birthday” and after he was like “well it doesn’t matter i didn’t want it from her anyway” well clearly you did if you felt the need to say it out-loud…. i have never told nor expected a happy birthday to any of my exs at all.\n\nI’m sorry this is so long I just rlly needed to rant and I want someone else’s opinion on what I should do. Am i overreacting and i’m just insecure or is he doing something off ??",

      "title": "How to move on from my father cheating on my mother",
      "selftext": "In April this year, I found out my father was cheating on my mother. I was the one who found it all and it was an awful time for me because I had to figure out how to confront my dad and make sure my mum found out. I made a post about it at the time here: https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/9JCBspvgi8\n\nSince then, things have come a long way. Immediately after finding out, my mum and siblings were completely devastated. We were all crying everyday and my dad kept buying flowers and roses for my mum. It was so pathetic. My mum flew out to see family for 2 weeks and this did her good. She went alone and she said she really had time to think. Me and my dad drove her to the airport and on the way back I screamed at him again and told him that he's ruined everything. While my mum was away, I cried so much about the whole situation, and argued a lot with my dad. It was a difficult time for everyone, my siblings were going through exam season and one of them had to get therapy from their university because they were really struggling and not coping well. \n\nThings slowly got better, my mum returned and she seemed more at peace with herself. She was more confident, knew her worth, I could feel that being away was really good for her. She's only got better since then. One day was really bad when I heard them arguing and my mum crying, but other than that, she seems better. \n\nShe's decided to stay with him. The most important thing for her has always been the family unit and she doesn't want to separate. She says that if she wants to get over this, she needs to try and forget about it and move on. She didn't say that to him, but to me. My siblings are doing better, one of them is very confident in her feelings and says what she thinks which is good. The other is more reserved and quiet, that worries me more. But in general, they're ok with my dad, they can act normal with him, and I think they feel more normal with him than I do. We haven't really spoken about it though. \n\nI can't get over this at all. I've tried to be nice to him, I've tried to act normal. I can't. It makes me feel sick. I hate when he hugs me and I hate seeing him mess around and be silly with my sisters. I feel like he doesn't deserve it. It just makes me so angry. I keep thinking of the messages I saw. They were disgusting. My sisters never saw them so they don't know the extent. I keep thinking about him having sex with that woman, in her house, in OUR FAMILY CAR. How the fuck can I get over that?? How is everyone acting normal? I feel like I'm the crazy one. I feel like I always bring the mood down but I just can't fake being happy with him. \n\nTo make everything worse for me, I teach in an adult educational institution and I recently saw that her name was added to the new students list. She's going to start studying. Where I work. I might see her in the corridors. I might have to fucking teach her. What then? What the hell am I supposed to do? My dad didn't think about the thousands of consequences of his actions. I just wish I could forget about this and be happy again but I can't. My family are able to move on and be happy so why can't I? I just really need some advice on what to do and how to move forward. I feel like I'm driving myself crazy thinking about this. ",

      "selftext": "I need advice because I feel like I am breaking apart. Right now in 2025 I’ve just found out again that my husband has been talking to someone on Ashley Madison. He only told me because the person or someone connected to her threatened to expose him unless he paid them money. He started the conversation by saying, *“you know how we never have sex and you ignore me.”*\n\nThe reality is that he has been unemployed since January of last year. I am the sole breadwinner, working full time, and I’m also in school full time. I am TIRED. Sex is not the most important thing on my plate right now. The last time we were intimate was maybe three or four weeks ago, not months, not years, but he still jokes constantly about how he “never gets any.” He has never once come to me to have an honest conversation about how he feels unloved or unwanted. Instead, he hides it, then goes online and seeks attention from strangers.\n\nWhen I confront him, it’s always excuses. He says he “needs attention.” He blames mental illness and says “it runs in his family.” He says I’m “difficult to talk to” and that he doesn’t know how I’ll react, so instead of trying, he looks elsewhere. It always circles back to me somehow being the problem, while I’m the one holding everything together.\n\nAnd this isn’t new. It’s the same cycle, every few years. In 2018 I found out he was talking to at least three women. He admitted to meeting one of them twice and went “riding around” with her and her aunt. Then he mailed her kid a video game “out of the goodness of his heart.” He only told me because the aunt threatened to out him to me unless he gave her money. Around that same time I saw him answering Craigslist ads, telling women he wanted “friends with benefits, maybe more,” and he had Kik and Tinder on his phone.\n\nIn 2014 it was a girl on *My Free Cams* from Knoxville. In 2011 it was dating profiles looking for “friends with benefits” while married to me. Every three to four years, like clockwork, the itch comes back, he gives in, and I’m left shattered.\n\nLast time he promised we’d go to counseling, and we never did. Each time he gives me just enough information to get me off his back and then expects me to move on, but I don’t move on. I can’t. His betrayal sits inside me every day, eating at me.\n\nNow I feel trapped. I don’t even know how to move on from this or how to walk away. And I feel guilty because he isn’t working, and part of me feels like if I leave, I’m abandoning someone who depends on me. But if I stay, I’m abandoning myself.\n\nThat’s the war inside me right now. Do I stay out of guilt and responsibility, or do I finally choose myself and walk away?\n\nHas anyone else lived this kind of cycle? How did you know when it was truly time to go? Is there even a way back from repeated betrayal, or am I clinging to something that has already burned to the ground?",

      "selftext": "I despise Overwatch. My wife and I got married less than a month ago and she met some guy on Overwatch to play with. Im not really into Overwatch anymore so she mostly played with other people which is fine. I noticed when she came to bed at like 7am (she was up all night playing with this guy) they were texting and the messages looked like sexting. I eventually went through her messages and found they were sexting and she sent him nudes.\n\nThe funny thing is she even mentioned to this guy that she loves her husband (me) so much and doesnt know what she would do if she lost him. And well I am destroyed, I removed her from my home, she went back to her home outside of the US and I will never see her again. My entire life has been upended and marriage destroyed in a flash crash. I'm in so much pain. I really wanted to take her back and forgive her but everything was horrible to read. They talked about hiding the messages from me too and keeping it a secret but I found out so fast. I dont want to live like this, I know giving a cheater a second chance is never the right choice but it hurt so horribly to get her out of my home and know im never seeing again even though the day before I was fully intending on spending the rest of my life with her.\n\nEveryone supporting me keeps telling me how lucky I was to discover infidelity this quickly into a marriage but I dont even care about that I'm in absolute agony every day. Idk if I should have given her a second chance.",

      "selftext": "I thought something like this happens in movies only. I'd been with my boyfriend for 5 years, known each other for close to 6. We were living together, planning our future alongside each other. Life was good, right?\n\nA few months ago an old friend texted me. She used to be my best friend years ago, but then she found some other friends and stopped talking to me. And she was never too good of a friend, would always get me into messy situations just for her own amusement, but to be honest I was pretty lonely so I just went along with it. I was hurt back then, but somehow I forgot, moved on and we started talking and have become somewhat close again.\n\nWhen she first met my boyfriend, she would praise how we were such a great couple. But then she started to say how I should break up with him, and even tried matching me with one of her friends!! At the same time, I noticed how her and my boyfriend become a bit too close for my liking, but everytime I would bring it up to either her or him, they'd call me crazy.\n\nA week ago, he, out of nowhere, packed his bags and said he needed some time alone to think our relationship through. It was an incredibly tough pill for me to swallow, but I had to respect his decision.\n\nYesterday I had this terrible gut feeling. I got in my car and drove to her house. And there it was. His car. I confronted him (she wouldn't even come out and talk, blocked me on all social media right away and just disappeared) and well, now I know.\n\nMy whole life, my plans, the love I thought was gonna last a lifetime, all gone. Just like that. Just because I invited this witch that had already hurt me before, back into my life.",

      "selftext": "I tried breaking up with him tonight. At first it seemed to be going well, I told him it was very difficult to come to this decision. I told him I love him, but after a lot of thought I realized I deserve better. He seemed to agree and say he does think I deserve better and said he truly believes he can and will change for the better and that he’s been looking up videos on how to be a better husband. His cheating hurt me deeply, and if he had been honest or ended it before getting caught, maybe I’d see integrity in him and be more open to working on things further. But that was the final straw for me. Which I made sure to explain to him. \n\nAt first, he seemed understanding, saying I was kind, that he learned a lot from me, and that he didn’t want things to end. I told him clearly that it needed to end. But when we got back to our cars, we hugged goodbye and we cried (he had not cried the entire conversation, until then, meanwhile, I cried multiple times) he said he wished he could take it all back, (the cheating and times he lied to me, all of it) and suggested he had a proposition for me, instead of breaking up. He proposed moving out but continuing to date to create some space between us. He said this way he could work on himself and I could have more space to work on myself while still remaining in a relationship…\n\nWhile I love him and would have loved things to work, logically I don’t see how this helps or benefits me in any meaningful way — long term or at all… If he hasn’t changed all that much in the last 7 years—and still cheated while talking to me about marriage and getting engaged this year—It’s hard to believe he’s going to change now. It’s soooo hard for me to put my foot down but I do think I need to send him a clearer message, maybe via text at this point. \n\nFor context: he lives in my home and he moved to another state to live with me. He left his hometown and his family behind, a few states away. He doesn’t love his current job (he quit his other job where he was cheating on me) and he has credit card travel points so he realistically could pack up and move back home within a matter of days if he wanted to. I am currently staying at my parents house the next few days to give him time to pack up and sort his things out. \n\nWhat should I add to the message to make things clear? How much time should I give him to move out? (He mainly will be taking clothes and things like that) should I offer to pay for any of his moving expenses?\n\nearlier post for context: https://www.reddit.com/r/survivinginfidelity/s/FHgsmH5qsl",

      "selftext": "This story is about as crazy as it sounds but stick with me here. Any advice is appreciated\n\n\nSo my girlfriend of 3 years (21M + 20F) recently slept with a guy in California, 26 hours away from me, after feeling “unwanted” and “unappreciated” in our relationship. This was 3 and a half weeks ago that she told me. \n\n4 days before she told me, (after she had already cheated and gotten back to town), she sat me down and had a conversation about how she feels that I wasn’t giving her enough attention and how I prioritized my friends time over hers. We had an amazing conversation, ranted about a lot of things we didn’t enjoy about the relationship and promised to do things to figure it out. We promised we wouldn’t breakup unless we tried everything possible to fix this. Needless to say I had my hopes up and was excited about bettering myself for her. Then she told me.\n\nShe told me she slept with someone in California and lied about it, telling me she was hanging with sorority girls the whole time. She said he “wanted” her and that he “made her feel that way,” and basically told me he made her feel something I hadn’t given her in a while. We broke off then and there, I sent my last text explaining how I was heartbroken and wanted to fix things prior to her telling me, and haven’t contacted her since.\n\nThen comes the fun part: where I am currently. For context, my best friend (20M) is dating my ex’s past best friend, (who isn’t friends with her anymore because of this whole ordeal.) Anyways, my best friend told me that his girlfriend hear from some shared friends between her and her ex that my ex is spreading rumors around her workplace that she “had to end things” because I was abusive, didn’t care about her, and that I was a horrible boyfriend. \n\nMy ex JUST went to Colorado with TWO FUCKING GUYS who she barely knows, camped with them, and just got back and is starting to spread these rumors.\n\nTo make things worse, she’s not telling anybody she’s a cheater, she’s just spreading this propaganda. She WAS an amazing girlfriend (or so I thought) and I was super happy with her, just had a rough summer and didn’t necessarily spend time with her as much as she wanted. She never communicated this, and said she felt that way for upwards of 3 months. She decided to tell me AFTER she had already cheated, but didn’t break up with me and “acted” like she wanted to fix it.\n\nI know for a fact that this is narcissistic behavior. I never would lay a finger on a woman in an abusive way (I know it’s easy for anybody to say that, but I know who I am, so bear with me here.) \n\nI feel like I poured my heart and soul out to her in this relationship, and I was planning on marrying her. But 3 weeks ago that all flipped like a switch. I know she’s being selfish, she’s hurting deep down, and she’s just avoiding taking guilt, but it still hurts like shit knowing that this is how far she’s taking this. I feel like I really tried my best to love her, and there was just miscommunication.\n\nAnyways, all that to say; I plan on never speaking to her again. I won’t play into the drama, I won’t EVER stoop as low as she is, even if she comes crawling back to me in 4 months. I’d like any other advice on how to go about this though, because it hurts like hell. I know what I am, I know I didn’t do anything to hurt her, and it feels like shit.\n\nAny practical real advice would be appreciated on how I move forward from something like this. It’s still fresh. Thank you for anybody who read this whole thing, I could use some friendly advice. :)\n\nTL:DR: My ex girlfriend cheated on me, went to Colorado with the guy and his friend after she told me, is hanging around horrible people, and is now telling people at her workplace that I was abusive and a horrible boyfriend (but won’t admit she cheated to any of them.)

      "selftext": "My (42M) now-ex fiancee (37F) and I would have been together for five years next week, and we lived together (along with her kids) for the last 3 years. She was attractive, had a wonderful personality, we complemented each other very well, had matched libidos, and generally seemed to be a good match, which had led me to date her after swearing never to date again (and consequently a five year dry spell) following a divorce 10 years ago.\n\nAbout four months ago, she became somewhat withdrawn. Got into online gaming. I didn't think too much of it, since it seemed to make her happy, and I'm not one to control her associations or how she spends her time. I did start feeling like we were communicating less, but I attributed this just to time availability rather than anything else. But about 3 months ago she accidentally sent me a message meant for someone else, with a \"you're so sweet (kiss face emoji).\" I brought it up, and it turns out it was meant for a gaming buddy, and she swore that everyone in the group joked like that--and indeed, when I looked at other messages from the (gaming) group, and there was a lot of similar banter between everybody as they goofed off, and I wasn't terribly concerned. But about a month ago, a family member came across a message thread with the buddy where the content, while not explicit, seemed inappropriate as it contained a lot of really flirty language that had been missing in our own communications. I again addressed it, was reassured that it was nothing, and I reinforced that I was really trying my best, but if there was anything else I needed to do to show my love and make her feel loved, I would do it. I doubled down on trying to reconnect, and we both agreed to try to communicate better (ie, frequent messaging and such) during the day and make time for each other, and we did! We also agreed to go to couple's counseling. And things seemed to be moving the way I wanted it to go.\n\nAnd then a week and a half ago I caught her sending explicit photos to the guy. She swears that there wasn't anything more, but the \"oh, I just decided to clean our bedsheets in the middle of the day\" a couple weeks ago would argue otherwise.\n\nI had previously decided (being aware of this possibility) that I would approach the situation with maturity and understanding, and would forgive as long as she wanted to move forward. That didn't happen--we got into it to say the least, and now we're staying in different houses (she's staying in \"our\" house (in my name) with all bills paid, driving \"our\"car (in my name)), and although she says she's sorry and made a mistake, she's apparently still talking to the guy while I'm trying to disentangle my finances, grieving the loss of not just her but of her kids and her wonderful family being lost from my life, and figuring out how to uproot my life. (and yes, I wanted to kick her out, but under state tenant law she's got 30 days before she has to vacate, so I'm trying to morally justify the fubar-ness of it all by trying to convince myself it'll make the transition easier for the kids, whom I loved like my own, and who didn't have a role in their mom's straying).\n\nThinking about the last few months, all the signs were there and although I recognized the possibility, I never thought that she was capable of it, because it seemed *so* out of character for her-- in addition to the great attributes mentioned above, she was always harping on the role of truth and honesty as being the foundation for a relationship. *In fact, as part of the \"reconnecting\" process, we had attended a session of couples therapy the very day before I caught her, and the whole session was literally her repeating her position on \"truth and honesty.\"*\n\nAnd now going on two weeks, I'm paralyzed and don't know what to do.\n\nShe was my best friend, and I shared with her things that I never told anyone else, and while the sexual component hurts, I'm finding the overt lies and gaslighting to be unbearable. I've got plenty of people--including some in her own family-- stating their support for me, but I'm finding that I can't believe *any* of them. When she looked me in the eye for months and made me feel like an idiot for suspecting something...when she was *formally with a therapist committing to truth* while she was sending nude photos to another man...nothing matters. I'm withdrawing from/not engaging with those very people who voice their support... because I'm finding that I really can't take anyone's word anymore. And I don't know if I ever can.\n\nIt's one thing to ruin romantic relationships for me, but she's pretty much ruined any and all relationships, and I feel more hurt, hopeless, and isolated than I ever have at any point in my life.",

      "title": "My girlfriend abandoned me while I was in the hospital with cancer - and started seeing my best friend.",
      "selftext": "My girlfriend abandoned me while I was in the hospital with cancer and started seeing my best friend.\n\nThis story is pretty insane, but I need to get it off my chest.\n\nI was with a woman for almost two years, and looking back, it’s clear she had a lot of traits of borderline personality disorder. I was stuck in the classic push pull cycle, she’d have meltdowns over the smallest things (something at work, or even something minor I said), spiral completely, and no amount of reasoning would calm her down. Then, after days or weeks of chaos, she’d act like nothing happened and want to pretend everything was fine. It was exhausting. It’s funny how rose coloured glasses can warp your reality, but that’s a lesson learned.\n\nAnyway, late 2023 I started having serious back pain. After a lot of tests, doctors finally found a large tumor in my spine that was crushing my spinal cord. On Christmas Eve 2023, I was rushed into emergency surgery to remove it, and I ended up in hospital for two months. The tumor had also spread to my shoulder and hip. I nearly lost my ability to walk.\n\nWhile I was in hospital, doctors told me I’d need to undergo radiation and chemotherapy once I had recovered enough from surgery. It was a lot to take in, fighting cancer, learning to walk again, and preparing for brutal treatment.\n\nAnd this is where it gets even worse. While I was in hospital, my girlfriend basically decided she “couldn’t handle it.” She stopped visiting, ghosted me, and pretty much abandoned me while I was literally fighting for my life. I’d try to reach out, but I’d only get cold, short replies until she stopped responding altogether.\n\nNot long after I was finally discharged in February 2024, right as I was about to start chemotherapy, my best friend at the time came over and confessed that he and my girlfriend had “developed feelings” for each other while I was in the hospital. While this was happening, his phone was blowing up with text messages from her freaking out and begging him not to tell me, because her parents would disown her if they found out, and rightfully so.\n\nI can’t even describe the rage I felt in that moment. I told him flat out that any ideas he had of getting together with my girlfriend were never going to happen, and when he pushed back, I grabbed a retractable baton I keep stashed by my couch and told him he had five seconds to leave my house or I was going to cave his skull in. He bolted. I’m not proud of that, but I’m not ashamed of it either. \n\nThe next day, she came over herself and confirmed it. Told me she had feelings for him, and that “he can give me everything,” like that was supposed to justify abandoning me in hospital; He is quite well off and he was obviously love bombing her with the promise of giving her everything she could ever want and a house in the country. Didnt have her pegged for a gold digger. \n\nLong story short: they did get together, but it went downhill fast. All of her volatile behavior transferred over to him, and since he’s a narcissistic, misogynistic type, it got very hostile and violent very quickly. Last I heard, she moved out of his place and back in with her parents. I haven’t spoken to either of them in over a year.\n\nShe’s sent me the occasional text since, saying she’s sorry and that she misses me, but I eventually wrote her a very long letter spelling out exactly what she did and how it made me feel. I basically held up a mirror she couldn’t escape from.\n\nToday, I’m doing better. I can walk again (mostly, but not without a cane, which is kind of cool in of itself), the cancer is currently stable, and I’m going for regular checkups and PET scans. I’m still not 100 percent, but I’m alive and I’m moving forward.\n\nI guess I just wanted to get this off my chest because sometimes it still hits me: I went from being in a two year relationship, to fighting for my life in hospital, to finding out my girlfriend and best friend betrayed me in the middle of all of it.

Nine months into our relationship my son from first marriage was with us during school holidays for the second time however ex asked to see son night before we were going to Jersey and I haven’t seen him since. The stress this has caused me and B over the last 18 months came to a head 5 weeks ago when I told B after three months of me being unemployed and feeling really bad about it that she deserves someone who can financially commit to the relationship. 2 weeks later I was offered the perfect job and I am now the person I was 2 years ago however despite me still living in house with B and us being strong friends she has moved on and been on two dates with M. We had a real heart to heart and she admits she still has feelings for me and said if I start loving myself, stopped getting grouchy over silly things and focused on the here and now not the cr*p caused by my ex during our marriage then she really feels we can restart our relationship. The real issue for me is I feel I am fighting two battles simultaneously, one to show B I have changed back into the man she fell in love with but whilst also trying to be better than M.\nHow can I do this, please any advice would be appreciated greatly.

He said he has never done anything physical and only likes to flirt with her because of the attention she gives him. Later on he admitted he has a crush on her and finds her attractive. \nHe reiterates over and over again that he still loves me snd regrets his actions. \nI don’t know how to believe him saying he still loves me but meanwhile is attracted to another person and flirts with her. \n\nThis came as we were days away from our 6th wedding anniversary. \nMy mental health counselor called it an emotional affair and I honestly was in denial about it. It’s so heartbreaking to know your significant other has eyes for another woman and continued to feed his attraction to her. \nHow do I know he truly does love me and he only did it for the attention she provided to him? \n\nI have the following feelings that I can’t fight off my mind: \n-he doesn’t love me like he said\n-he doesn’t find me attractive\n-has grown tired of me\n-I’m no longer his one and only if he’s made room in his life for another woman\n\n\nI understand we’re not blind to other people and we can find this attractive but to the extent of feeding that attraction for six months? Continuously flirting with her? \n\nI found out became randomly saw the messages on his phone with her. He didn’t delete them or try to hide them. BUT immediately called his “buddy” coworker to let him know and hours later the female coworker send two text messages and unsends them. I saw that a week later, I asked him about it and he looked at me straight in the eyes and said he had no clue about it and that it was the first time he knew about it. I then check his messages with his “buddy” and see that he texted him about those unsent messages. Meaning he did see the unsent notifications but yet he lied to me about it. The night before he lied again and promised he would change and be honest and truthful but yet lied to my face yet again.  \n\nLying so much for a simple crush is mind baffling. I don’t know how to feel or where to go with this. Everyone around me down plays it and says it was just simple text message flirting and that if nothing physical happened then I need to move on and forgive him. BUT I CAN’T. I have doubts and pain that my “perfect” marriage was everything but perfect and I had no clue about it until now. ",

      "selftext": "D-Day was in October 2023. My wife had an emotional affair with a man she met before our marriage — texts, long conversations, declarations of love in messages — though she insists it never got physical. I discovered the affair by finding deleted WhatsApp conversations where they expressed their love to each other etc.. \n\nAfter confronting her, she confessed, deleted social media accounts, and we decided to work on reconciliation for the sake of our 5-year-old son and upcoming twins...\n\nI truly believed we were making progress... until I recently (in May) discovered his contact number under an alias called B. Even though his nummer was on the blocked list. When i confronted and asked her if there is anything else i should know about, she told me that right after D-Day she secretly contacted him again, but this time through her best friend's Instagram account. She claims it was just to give him a heads-up that I might reach out to him and when i do that he should tell me the truth and be honest about their relationship (which she maintains was never physical).\n\nI'm emotionally shattered at this point. We had already gone through so much to rebuild, therapy, long conversations, vulnerability... And now I'm questioning everything again.\n\nLiving with this constant uncertainty is super exhausting. Even if that message was truly innocent as she claims, the secrecy behind it feels like another knife in my back. When she says she was \"afraid\" to tell me about contacting him, I can't help but wonder: afraid of what exactly? My reaction to her continued deception? The fact she felt she needed to hide anything at all speaks volumes.\n\nHas anyone here rebuilt successfully \\*after\\* a second breach of trust like this? Is this salvageable, or am I just prolonging the inevitable?\n\nEDIT/UPDATE:\n\nThanks to everyone who responded. Your support and honesty really helped. The repeated breach of trust makes this situation incredibly hard.\n\nRight now, I’m taking space to clear my head and focus on my kids. Divorce is very much on the table, but I’m not rushing it, just trying to process everything with a clear mind.\n\nAppreciate all the input.\n",

      "selftext": "My husband and I have been dating on and off for 5 years, steadily dating for 2 years and married for almost four months. Over the past two years I have found signs of infidelity and each time he has lied to me, gas lighted me when confronted and tends to default to the \"I don't remember\" game. We love each other very much but I believe he has a sex addiction that he has been in denial about. He's never been faithful to any woman he has been with. \n\nBefore we got married I found a lot of porn (he had told me he doesn't watch porn) and I also found that on Facebook 90% of his activity was page visits to 50% internet prostitutes and 50% real, local women, very attractive and provocative. After a huge fight and him trying for days to stick to Shaggy's good Ole \"it wasn't me\" (deny, deny), he finally admitted it but said it was only when we would fight, promised he would never do it again.\n\nThings had been going great and we seemed closer than we had been in a long time but I had this gut feeling so I looked and sure enough, he's back to hitting dozens of this same mix of women's profiles. I instantly felt sick. We got in a huge fight. He always gets upset with me for being upset, does not apologize or take responsibility for hurting me, basically punishes me for pulling away and lies to me in a way that is just so insulting to my intelligence.\n\nI take my vows very seriously. I have never cheated on anyone I've been with. I am very monogamous and I cant be in a marriage where I have to deal with this. He said \"well, its not like I f'd them!\" I have explained to him so many times before that to me, putting sexual energy and attention towards other women is not OK with me. It all leads to the same thing and creates a disconnect in our relationship.\n\nIt really feels over this time. I am not the type to cry but I have been crying my head off fir three days, walking around in a daze, feeling like I've made a huge mistake by marrying this person. He hasn't once tried to apologize or show any remorse. I told him that he broke my heart and he said, \"yeah I know I did\". I moved ecerything out of our bedroom and into the spare bedroom and I've been staying away frim him. I gave him back the ring.\n\nSo last night, after three days of him standing firm that he didn't do anything wrong or if he did, he doesn't remember, he sends me this text that doesn't feel sincere to me. It feels like a desperate attempt to use the right words and I think I'd be an idiot to believe him but I also believe in fighting for a marriage when you love each other.\n\nI don't understand sex addiction. It makes me sick that he feels he just can't help himself and I want to be the only woman or nothing. I can't see spending the rest of my life with a man I will never trust and I also don't want to spend the rest of my life without him. I don't know which would hurt more.\n\nI told him that I'm not able to give him an answer right now. I want things to be ok but the thought of being in the same bed with him or even having him touch me at all right now makes me physically ill.\n\nEdit: Here's his text apology.\n\n\n---\n\nI know you don't want to talk but I need to say this, your right I'm I hurt you badly and I'm hurting too because of my actions, I need you not to give up on me because I'm going to find outside help through wellpoint, I know now I have disrespected you as my wife and your wishes, I don't want to lose you, I am so so sorry for my infidelity and I know now I need help, please consider staying with me because I can't do this alone\n\n\n---\n",

      "selftext": "It’s been over a year since I found out about my husband’s longtime betrayal/infidelity, and almost a year since I asked him to move out. The final straw that pushed me to initiate a divorce was when I broke my foot (with him!) a month ago and he wouldn’t go to the ER with me the next day when it was clear it was broken and not sprained, because he had a date. Last Friday was our first mediation, which went well in all the substantial ways, but I’ve noticed that since early that day I’ve kind of lost my mind with fresh grief and something  like PTSD.  For instance he had a date before mediation that continued later that night and I’m pretty sure this new person is now his serious girlfriend, which has me all kinds of triggered.  And it’s really too bad because we were in a friendly, amicable place before this and my reactivity is ruining what’s left of our relationship, and more importantly, my peace of mind. My question to those of you have initiated a divorce in response to finding out that your spouse betrayed you is this: what happened to your emotional well being after the process started? I am in so much pain again (almost like right after I found out) and am wondering if this is a typical or unusual  reaction, and how long it might last before I am in a more peaceful state ",

She does not know yet. I’ve told him in the past that if we can’t work things out, I will have to tell her why we’re splitting up. She’s going to ask questions and I’m not lying to her for his benefit. He had the audacity yesterday to ask me if we split, could I please not tell her about the affair with their coworker. It honestly set me off because it seems like he’s more concerned about his reputation at work than fighting for me and our marriage. He said that I’m being unreasonable and spiteful, but I feel like his actions have consequences and it’s time for him to face some. \n\nSo, am I wrong? Should I just leave quietly and not tell anyone?",

      "selftext": "I tried posting on Asoneafterinfidelity, but don’t think they let me… so I’m trying here…\n\nBTW: The original post is from last night and the update under was just written.\n\nIt’s a bit long, so thank you if you do use your time reading this and responding ❤️\n\nDon’t know what to do….😩😩\n\nYea….🙃\n\nPeople weren’t lying when they said you’ll never really know how you’ll react when it finally happens to you 😂\n\nNot gonna tell the full story today (found out only 4 hours ago)… I’ve just been sitting inside, overthinking, drinking beer, and watching soccer since I got home from work.\n\nFor some reason, I just want to go see her tonight and be with her one last time, because I honestly don’t know if I can ever accept or forgive this. Part of me just wants to ghost her and end things when I leave.\n\nThe thing is, I’m not even sure if she realized I caught them or not. She drove past me with her ex in the car, and I didn’t notice until they were right next to me. I only saw her side profile and his stupid hat that he always wears.\n\nShe’s been acting completely normal since then—except right after driving past me. She immediately posted a Snapchat story (yes, people here still use Snapchat) and I messaged her right away to see if she’d reply with a picture or something to show me where she was. Instead, she left me on read for 40 minutes and then posted a photo with her friends that she had already told me she was going hiking with today.\n\nI slept over at her place last night, left for work at 6:30 AM, and she said she was going hiking at 3 PM. So now I’m overthinking whether she spent the whole day with her ex while I was at work. Her oldest kids are visiting their grandparents out of town, and her youngest is with her ex-husband (not the same ex in this story). And I know she doesn’t usually just sit inside on a sunny day, so yeah…\n\nI already knew she was on decent terms with this ex again, but I thought it was just texting—not hanging out in his car when she can’t be with me.\n\nThe thing is, I don’t even know if she’s actually having an emotional or physical affair with him. But if it’s innocent, why hide it? Why not just tell me if he’s “just a friend”? I’ve told her before that I don’t care if she has male friends. She’s even introduced me to all the others—except this one.\n\nYeah, my head’s all over the place right now. I honestly don’t know what to do 😂\n\nAnd just to clarify—this isn’t AI. English isn’t my first language, so I wrote everything myself and then used ChatGPT just to clean up the grammar.\n\n(I posted this yesterday but don’t think they let it go public) \n\nUPDATE: \n\nI ended up going out to the bars with friends, instead of sitting inside thinking only about the situation….\n\nMe and her texted (snapchat) some back and forth throughout the night…. I first wanted to be with her and go up to her, but she ended up going to a friend where they had a little girls night at her friend’s place… I know they didn’t go out to bars and stuff but only stayed in.\n\nI really don’t know how to feel… because ever since she drove past me… she has acted way differently then she used to before….\n\nFor example she used to answer my text almost immediately 10 minutes max, even when she was with her kids, hiking or hanging with friends… but since last day, she has spent minimum 40 to a hour to answer the most simple texts…. One text from last night she used 2 hours to respond…. Literally just now I’m waiting for her to answer from a text I sent 23 minutes ago…. \n\nI don’t know….. I know that her way of breaking things with men are to just ghost them and don’t answer their snaps or messages… and I have a small feeling that she’s almost trying to do the same with me now, the only difference is that I know she still has feelings for me, so that maybe why she hasn’t ghosted me 100% yet…. 🤷‍♂️\n\nI don’t know how she can just go from “I miss you so bad” “I miss you every time I’m not with you”  “I can’t sleep properly when I’m not with you” (she has insomnia) to not even respond for 40 minutes when I know now that she’s sitting at home with her phone laying right next to here some place… and all this just started right after she drove past me…\n\nSo yea I maybe think that this relationship is soon to be over\n\nAnd I forgot to say this because I almost had forgot it when I started writing… but I asked her yesterday right after I tried posting my story…. I asked her in a “funny” way if she drove past my job around that time…. She took some time to answer but she did after around 20 min with that she was on the hike with her friend from 2-6 pm and sent me a picture of the nature and another one of her friend (could this be her trying to show me that it wasn’t a man with her?), but the thing is…. She told me and showed me a message from her friend on Friday, where it said that the hike wasn’t before 3… so I think I caught her in a lie on that… I didn’t say that tho, and just let it be…. But from that point on it was when she began to give slow answers back…. \n\nSo yea like I said… I have a strong feeling that she has cheated on me with her ex, for how long idk…. And that this relationship is soon to end….",

      "selftext": "So I flaired this as advice, and I am looking for it, but I am also looking for clarity, fresh perspectives, ability to rant and be heard, and to fulfill the need to tell someone my story. \n\nMy boyfriend (31) and I (female, 29) have been together for 7 years and living together for 6.\n\nSo I had noticed he was texting a lot on his phone recently, so I checked his messages. I found out he was having an online emotional affair with a girl he met on discord. He told her \"I love you\", role played what was supposed to be *our* BDSM dynamics with her, etc. I confronted him the same day. \n\nThe confrontation was messy. He didn't give me many responses. Mostly shrugs. He gave me a letter he had typed up a few weeks prior explaining that our intimacy issues made him \"not see me as a sexual being anymore\" and he'd been checked out for a long while. \n\nThing is, we did have intimacy issues due to my birth control. Every single birth control causes low to no libido for me. But he only ever mentioned in passing that it was such a severe issue and mostly left the problem for just me to fix. He never told me he was starting to feel checked out. \n\nHe says this is what led to our BDSM dynamic crumbling apart. But I noticed less effort on his end unrelated to the loss of libido. And he says that it's a part of who he is and he can't be in a relationship without it. Well, neither can I. He said he just assumed I \"changed\" and stopped wanting these things. \n\nBut now, he has been in, basically, an online  relationship with this girl for 7 months and says he has feelings for her. He hasn't made any moves to move out, but he hasn't made any moves at reconciliation with me.\n\nI think he has at least somewhat cut off contact with her and we've had one session of couples therapy. But it feels like he is waiting for something to give him the magic answer to \"should I stay or should I go\"\n\nHe told so many people on his discord channel/server/whatever you call it about our intimacy struggles. Another member keeps egging him on to leave me, calling me undevoted, and \"how could he waste a chance to be with a devoted girl with big boobs for someone flat chested like me\". I feel so humiliated. Mortified. My whole life, sex struggles, even health conditions have been aired publicly to many people. They are treating this like a spectator sport that I wasn't even aware I was part of. \n\nHe told this other member that I got off the BC and that it's been helping my libido. And told her \"what am I supposed to do, just tell her it's over and split our things?\" and that he can't talk to the AP right now; implied he wanted to give us a chance. but at the same time, hasn't made any moves to try to bring thst spark back between us. \n\nThis is all killing me. He gives me scraps of affection here and there. He shows no signs of guilt for making me feel this way, but he has always been very closed off emotionally. \n\nThing is, I love him. We have *so much* in common, our relationship was phenomenal before these intimacy issues. And he seems at least partially willing to throw it all away for a girl he hasn't even met in person. It's like he's almost living in a fantasy world. \n\nWe have a home together, a cat, so many of our items are shared. We are deeply intertwined with each other's families at this point. \n\nI know what I want. But he doesn't seem to know. And he seems keen on just remaining in limbo indefinitely, hoping for an answer to just come to him. He admits that our relationship was good before, and admits he is aware that relationships do have issues, but he hasn't made any moves to even test the waters to repair any of it. Like he's scared of fully committing to making this work and losing his back up plan in the process. \n\nMy heart hurts. And I don't know where to go from here. Any advice, perspectives, or just similar stories or words of support would be greatly appreciated. I'm really spiraling out of control and barely keeping my head above water as is. \n",

      "title": "My final goodbye letter",
      "selftext": "Tomorrow is Labor Day and I’m going to send him this:\n\nHappy Anniversary my Love\n\nOne year ago today, that text exposed your secret life, the lies, the betrayals, and marked the beginning of the spiral into my own personal hell.\n\nOne month ago, you kicked me out of a place I was beginning to call home.\n\nOne week ago, I was still basking in the glow of loving you, when you turned cold and heartless.\n\nYou want to know what happened that night? I was hopeful when you said I could move back in. But Saturday showed you weren’t going to change. You were frustrated that I wouldn’t dance with other guys and complained about how our sex life changed. I brought up your cheating. That’s what triggered you to throw me out of your life, for the last time.\n\nWhen I tell people the history of the last year, they look at me in shock and can’t believe I gave you so many chances, that I stayed. They see you as a monster, destroying a beautiful woman.  I stayed because I am broken too. My brain and nervous system remember your arms wrapped around me so very tight, whispering in my ear “I’ve got you sweetheart, I’ve got you“. That is the man that I am grieving right now. I am grieving being in the back of the truck looking at the stars, freely exploring each other‘s bodies, being weird, awkwardly dancing, spontaneous trips.\n\nI understand that level of closeness causes your nervous system to retreat and you go numb to protect yourself. My brain understands that but my heart hurts. My brain can’t reconcile how awful I’ve been treated with how wonderful you are. That is the cruelty of betrayal trauma. My body and my nervous system can’t handle both truths.\n\nI’ve spent a year clinging to the version of you I couldn’t stop loving, even though it was destroying me. The version that is kind, funny, loving and charming — the version I now sadly realize you showed to all those other women too.\n\nYet I’m the only one who lived with the version of you that was shut down…  the cold, selfish, and even cruel version of you. The man who denied knowing “Deb”, leaving me sobbing on the floor as he went to bed. The man who closed a garage door on me as I knelt in the snow crying. The man who broke off the relationship on our 8th anniversary to be with his mistress.  The man who texted he was “done” and slept with Karen.\n\nI want you to feel even an ounce of the pain that’s ripped me apart for an entire year, and longer even. Every text unanswered, the growing distance, the times I knew you were lying but couldn’t prove it and all the times I begged you to be a better partner. Trying desperately to connect with you but sensing something else.\n\nBut the truth is, you probably won’t feel it, you can’t. You are too shut down. Because if you did, the weight of your shame and guilt would crush you. So you’ll distract yourself, minimize, deflect, avoid and tell yourself it was inevitable, but it wasn’t. Lying and cheating were a choice. Your choice.\n\nYou called me your girl, your love, and held me in your arms as you lied to my face, excitedly pursued other women, and gave away everything that I thought was mine. You were two different people, and that destroyed us.\n\nThe thrill of the chase mattered more to you than loyalty or knowing right from wrong or even love.\n\nWhat I gave you was true and pure. But you took the deepest love I’ve ever had and treated it like it was disposable and shattered my trust like it was inconsequential. I thought I was your everything but I wasn’t was I? How could I be if you couldn’t handle the responsibility of protecting my heart, me, and us. And that’s the biggest tragedy of all. It feels like you only really loved what I GAVE you.\n\nI hate myself for letting this happen — for ignoring all the signs and holding onto hope you’d meet me halfway, take ownership through honesty, and show the willingness to fix the broken parts of yourself that caused so much destruction. Because if you did, that would mean I was as important to you as you were to me.  You were willing to heal yourself, like I was. I hate that I would still give everything to get you back and make the pain go away.\n\nI hate that I feel so shattered, so pitiful, that our amazing adventures are tainted memories now and you made me feel like I wasn’t enough when I was more than enough.\n\nI hate that I still love you and wish you would choose us despite it all. I grieve over the future I thought I had with you. Future adventures, our own place, my wedding ring on your finger. That is the scar you’ve left me with.\n\nYou told me it was never going to work… you’re right, it wasn’t if you weren’t going to be honest with me or yourself. You have a problem which is why you couldn’t stop escaping into other women’s arms when things got tough or it was time to show up in the relationship.\n\nIt makes me sad that you’ll keep chasing the high like an addict, trying to fill the empty void inside, each encounter never being enough, craving the next hit.  All to avoid what’s true and real. You had it all but couldn’t handle it.\n\nI was willing to be by your side, for the rest of your life, if you had the courage to look in the mirror and face the man staring back. But you are too scared to even try. And that’s what hurts the most. I was willing to look into the deepest depths of myself, but you wouldn’t. You can tell yourself you tried, but we both know there are more secrets.\n\nSo I hope you enjoy living a life in the superficial, continuing to try filling the void and chasing the next high. Because you threw away the only woman who saw all the broken bits of you and loved you anyway.\n\nDon’t bother replying. I’ll block you as soon as I hit send. Leave my tequila, rum, vodka and tracker on the porch. Congratulations — you don’t have to sneak around anymore. Oh, and turn location off on your work phone, I don’t need to see when you’re at the next Bumble date’s house knowing you’re fucking her.",

Almost 2 weeks of trying to work things out after the 1st DDay I discovered he had been still talking to her and slept with her again, three times.  One time it was on the same day that I slept with him. And another was after I found out he was talking to her the second time and I was drunk texting him telling him I missed him and he was telling me he wanted to work it out while he was with her. He was adamant it was just sex until I found a screenshot he had taken where he told her that he thought he loved her and she said she loved him. She told me they would kiss and cuddle, and were definitely emotionally intimate. He has since confessed to these things after I found out from her. He swears there are no more secrets/lies but I don't know if I believe that. \n\nWe had a conversation where I told him my (now ex) best friend has a history of being disloyal to her partner when she felt like she wasn't getting enough from him (never full blown cheating, but sending nudes, flirting, etc.) Since then he's said he felt manipulated by her and that he thinks he has sex addiction. He's now blocked her on everything and we're going to couples therapy,  and he's starting individual therapy as well. He just got out of the military, and has been spiraling since he made the decision to get out. He found comfort in her because they both have avoidant attachment styles and very similar backgrounds (they share the same culture, whereas I do not, but have always made every effort to understand and empathize as best I could). They were giving eachother advice on how to better their respective marriages while actively ruining their marriages by having this affair. \n\nWe don't have any human children,  just a dog and 2 cats. I've been staying with my mom while I figure out what I want. I'm scared to go back but I'm also scared to not be there and not be able to see if he's still being untrustworthy. He swears he's going to regret this for the rest of his life and prove his love to me. He has a history of gaslighting/borderline emotional abuse and treating me poorly emotionally (not providing my love languages to me). I just turned 24 and I don't want to waste another year on a marriage that might be pointless if he doesn't change. My mom is worried I've gotten myself stuck in an abuse cycle I won't be able to get out of. \n\nHow do I learn to trust again? How will I ever know if he's telling the truth?  This was a double betrayal that I NEVER expected from either of them and I'm so so heartbroken and panicked.",

      "selftext": "Everyone knows about monkey-branching: people who never let go of one relationship until they’ve secured the next. Like monkeys in the trees, they won’t release one branch until they’ve grabbed another.\n\nBut what’s rarely discussed is why this strategy often works. The truth is, it’s usually easier to seduce someone who’s already in a relationship than someone who’s single.\n\n👉 If the person is single: you have to prove you’re better than all the other potential options. Dozens, maybe hundreds of competitors.\n\n👉 If the person is taken: you only have to seem better than their current partner. It’s a one-on-one comparison.\n\nThat’s why monkey-branchers tend to succeed — consciously or not, they aim where the competition is the weakest. Seducing someone who’s taken = 1v1. Seducing a single person = battle royale.\n\nBut here’s the catch: relationships that start this way almost never last long-term. If someone monkey-branches to you, there’s a good chance they’ll eventually monkey-branch away from you. The same dynamic that made it easy to “win” them also makes the foundation unstable. Trust issues, insecurity, and constant comparisons usually turn things toxic pretty fast.\n\nTime is another big factor. The longer someone stays in their current relationship, the more “data points” they collect to compare their partner against you.\n\nAt first, it might be easy to look better — you’re new, exciting, and different. But as time goes on, they’ll inevitably stack your flaws against their partner’s flaws, your strengths against their partner’s strengths. The comparison doesn’t freeze the moment they meet you; it keeps updating.\n\nThat’s why even if monkey-branching works in the short term, it often unravels later. Time tends to expose whether you were really “better,” or just a temporary escape.\n\nIn short: monkey-branching might be easier in the moment, but it’s rarely sustainable.\n\n(Bonus : Another angle to this: if your partner has friends they confide in about every personal problem, the risk can come from there too. That person knows exactly what’s not working in your relationship and can position themselves as the “solution.”\n\nIt’s not always intentional, but when someone has the playbook of your partner’s frustrations, it’s much easier for them to step in and look like the better option.)\n\nAt the end of the day, if someone can so easily be taken from you, they were never really yours to begin with. Many will try to take your partner, but if they succeed, you’re actually the lucky one..",

      "selftext": "This is going to be a long story, and it’s not for the faint of heart—so buckle up.\n\nI’m a 41-year-old male, and I’ve always had a hard time dating. My first girlfriend cheated on me, which hurt deeply because we were engaged and supposed to get married. After that, I didn’t date for about five years.\n\nWhen I tried putting myself out there again, it seemed like most girls weren’t interested in dating a guy who’s 5’6”. I tried everything—dating sites, coaches, speed dating—but had no real success. I kept meeting people who were emotionally unavailable, not serious, or just flaky and fake. Eventually, I decided to look elsewhere.\n\nI got my passport and started looking overseas. That’s when I met a young woman named Virma online. We chatted for a while, and eventually I flew to her country to meet in person. For the first time in a long time, it felt like I had finally found my true love. We shared the same goals, and the relationship took its natural course.\n\nAfter a year and a half, we got married. I filed the paperwork for her to come live with me in the U.S. and eventually become a citizen. But on Christmas Day of 2023, while we were still in the middle of the immigration process, I got a strange text from a man saying he had information to tell me. I asked what it was, but he never replied, so I brushed it off as some creep.\n\nIn February 2024, my wife had her visa interview scheduled. I was told I didn’t need to attend, but then she called me crying, saying I needed to be there because they had “information” to tell me. Confused, I rescheduled the interview and bought tickets to join her.\n\nA week before I left, I got another text—this time from someone named Owen. He claimed he had photos and videos of my wife with another man. At first, I thought he was just a jealous ex, but the pictures were recent. My wife had lost weight recently, and in the photos, she was clearly slimmer. That’s when it started to sink in that this wasn’t some random guy lying to me.\n\nOwen revealed himself as an investigator on our case. He claimed he had been monitoring our phones, and that’s how he found the evidence. He even said something similar had happened to him and that he was risking his job to warn me. I didn’t know how to process any of it, so I decided to confront my wife directly when I arrived.\n\nAt the Airbnb, I asked her about Owen and the pictures. She insisted they were old and that Owen was just an ex trying to break us up. I wanted to believe her—after all, why would my wife lie?\n\nAt the visa interview, they separated us and asked rapid-fire questions. We answered fine, but then an officer pulled me aside. He told me they had been monitoring her social media, and it looked like she was living two different relationships. My heart sank. I thought we’d be approved, but instead, the case was denied. My wife begged me for forgiveness, swearing it was a one-time mistake. Against my better judgment, I forgave her. I told myself the long distance might have been too much for her, and I fought to get our case reopened.\n\nThree months later, the consulate asked if I still wanted to proceed, even though they had doubts. I said yes. Looking back, I should have said no. But I was in love—or maybe just blinded by it.\n\nEventually, the case was approved. My wife flew to the U.S., and I was thrilled. I didn’t push for counseling, even though I should have. At first, things seemed fine, but after a surgery she needed, I started noticing red flags again. She was glued to her phone—taking it to the bathroom, sleeping with it under her pillow, hiding the screen.\n\nIn February of this year, I confronted her again. Things calmed down afterward, so I thought maybe it was over. But about two weeks ago, she left her phone out, which was unusual. When I glanced at it, I saw 52 notifications from Hinge—a dating app. Dozens of men messaging her. My stomach dropped.\n\nI confronted her the next day—what I call “D-Day.” I told her I was done, and she needed to move out. A week later, she packed her things and left. That was the last time I saw or spoke to her.\n\nNow, it’s been two weeks, and I feel completely empty. Some days I’m furious, other days I’m crushed. I feel like I wasted five years of my life and thousands of dollars for nothing. Like my whole life has been a lie. At 5’6”, dating has always been hard for me, and now it feels nearly impossible. I’ve always dreamed of starting a family, but at 40, I feel like that dream is slipping away.\n\nI don’t know what the future holds, but right now I’m devastated. Thanks for listening to my story.",

Not even acknowledging that cheating is inexcusable. Blaming me for not giving her this and that. But I didn't even think anything was wrong. She was so good at letting resentment and feelings fester, that I thought everytime I asked if we're fine, she said yes. When she confessed about it, because of what she'd shown (honesty, apology, remorse) I gave her a chance. But the passivity, the lack of eagerness, and accountability to what she did made me no choice to put up a boundary that if she didn't show the qualities I'm requiring, then we're done. I was still hoping that she'd change. Well, the complete opposite happened, she doubled down on what she did, still deflecting external factors and failing to see what's wrong with it. Why is a grown adult like this, any sane person would be eager and would be remorseful and bend down to the one they cheated on. Only a child blames the world for what they did, and that's exactly who she is. She made it all about her, when I was the one who was hurt. ",

Spent years trying to recover a marriage after revealed in 2023 that spouse is a SA. \nI made it very clear back in December 2024(after another dday), if there were anymore affairs we would separate immediately and divorce would be inevitable. \nThought we were good, as we had no issues in 8 months(that’s the longest we have gone), until a week ago, when I discovered another affairs.\nAfter years of therapy and so many AP that I stopped counting. I finally got the strength to leave and put him out. \nMentally I’m ok, but with all the manipulation and PTSD, I have to remind myself daily that perpetual infidelity is abuse. \nAnyway my question is, what is will this do to my kids, 6y and 4y? \nWe are never getting back together, but my oldest (she’s a big daddy’s girl), is really struggling. I hold space for her, I allow her to express her emotions however she needs, and reassure her that it’s not her fault, that we love her and support her. \nHow do I explain to her that we can’t be together? I want to be honest, but I don’t want to say anything disparaging. ",

      "selftext": "I (33m) recently found out (on our 6th anniversary) that my wife (30F) was having an intense emotional affair with a friend of mine and military comrade for a year and a half. I checked her phone because she was being extremely weird if I had her phone in my hand. I found private instagram stories between her and my friend. The messages absolutely broke my heart. They included telling each other that they loved each other, calling each other honey (which she called me) and wishing each other a happy weekend going into our anniversary weekend. That is just what hadn’t been deleted and I know the rabbit hole goes deep.. After she was exposed, she admitted that they had been talking for about a year and a half (a quarter of our marriage). He is also married to a really great woman, of whom they have 2 children. My wife and I don’t have children as we had 2 very tough pregnancy losses. As we fought and I dug for more information, I found out that they had sent each other nudes, talked on the phone for hours while I was at work and out of town for the military and (allegedly) only ever met up once and kissed.. I found this all out around July 6-7th.\n\nI have always prided myself in being a good supportive husband. I was so in love with my wife, was constantly calling her beautiful and made her feel seen and loved and respected and wanted. Our sex life was definitely above average. It slowed down a little bit after our losses but I always lusted after her. But when these friends came around, I always had a really uneasy feeling about the two of them together and so did his wife. When confronted (often) about their interactions and friendship, it was met with anger and gaslighting and I was made to feel like I was being insane and jealous.\n\nWhen these truth came out, she felt a lot of remorse and still feels it to this day and apologizes often.. Frankly, it feels like a sorry they were caught. They have since ceased all communication, and social media’s have been deleted. Initially, I threatened to leave and settled with moving into the spare bedroom for a month to gather myself and my feelings. I know it will be a long road to recovery and forgiveness. This week I have moved back into the bedroom as things have been feeling a little more normal together. I have good days and bad days..\n\nMy heart hurts so bad and I still feel so crushed but I also yearned for normalcy in my life but now that the dust has settled, I’m finding myself having very little romantic feelings for my wife. I’m trying really hard to get that feeling back in my chest but I’m feeling like my spark and fire for the love of my life has been reduced to a flicker.. I don’t know what to do. I still very much love my wife but I’m so angry and hurt and destroyed by what happened and I don’t know what to do or how to move forward. Our sex life feels so grey to me now and I can’t even finish most of the time. Not that I can’t stay excited but it’s more so, I mentally can’t get myself there.\n\nWe have gone to multiple marriage counseling sessions and I have my own therapist but I’m finding myself rapidly falling out of love with the person that used to bring me so much joy. We were always a benchmark for all our friends on how relationships should be. We never fought, we loved so hard and we were best friends. I’m at a complete loss and my life and home feels so muted and sad now. Like I said, I still very much love her and want to make this work but I can never fully trust her with my heart again. I feel so lost and could use some help and advice..",

      "selftext": "Hey guys I recently found this sub after searching for others advice. Me and my husband have been married almost 10 years. We have 3 children together and have been mostly in a good marriage. We both are recovering addicts since a year before we got married. \n\nMy husband has always had an alcohol problem. For the first 3 years of our marriage it was an alcoholic rollercoaster. Verbal and physical abuse. I called the police on him and left and he got better and was better since then. And after that it was like a fairytale marriage. Flowers, compliments the whole 360. \n\nFast forward to this year, husband drinks again. I made him leave. He try’s to buy escorts online, relapses while drunk on our DOC and I found out everything. He was sorry told me it was the alcohol and we got back. Trust was lacking on my side. But I never let it show. \n\nLast week I found drugs in his work pants again. Confronted him, he said he didn’t care it helps him work. I told him I can’t have meth around the kids or me and I was done. He stopped and said he would quit. Let me flush the rest. My trust was obviously compromised 100%. I told him he’d have to earn it back. He was using meth at work and coming home to smoke weed so I couldn’t notice the side effects. I also work so much sometimes 9 am to 11 pm. (I am the bread winner) that I blamed my work life for his mistakes. \n\nThen last night I find Snapchat and Facebook on his phone while fixing YouTube for my daughter. Mind you we both haven’t had social media for 9 years as it was a trigger for relapse. Nothing besides Reddit or quora was a mutually decided social platform allowed in the marriage. \n\nThe Snapchat and Facebook had many females on it. And no males except two. Some females from our past that I know and some random ones. He was always starting and holding intimate conversations with them. My heart is broken because for the last few days I was always being left on read. Or just straight up ignored. Responses came hours after my texts saying he’s so busy he will talk to me when he’s off work. While these others were getting instant responses. It makes me wonder if he’s still using. And I don’t know how many more chances I can give him. I feel so betrayed. And for the last 6 months I feel as if I am the only one trying to fix this marriage \n\nI am young only 28yrs old and know I would have time to heal and move on. But he’s all I’ve ever known and I don’t know what to do ",

We’ve had limited contact (only about divorce stuff) for about 3 weeks which has done wonders for my mental health. \n\nHowever the other day i heard that AP (also married, getting divorced) is going around saying that she “made the right choice just the wrong circumstances” and that my husband is the best relationship shes ever had etc etc. he sucks so that sentiment won’t last long. But it really hurt me all the same. \n\nA thought thats driven me nuts is that they could be together forever and I could be alone for the rest of my life. I know it’s not super reasonable (I’m 24) but I’ve been with my husband since i was 18 and always felt so lucky since i knew a lot of people who struggled to find a partner (serves me right lol). It just feels so incredibly unfair. This is also my first ever actual breakup and it had to be this horrible and traumatizing divorce. My goal in life has always been to be a wife and mom so it’s hard since I don’t have much of a career or ambition like that but basically my dream depends on me finding someone else. \n\nI’ve done a lot of searching on this sub and already seen tons of good success stories of people recovering and finding someone else but could use a little extra hope right now. If anyone wants to share their story or any advice I’d love to hear it. Thanks everyone :) ",

I’ve also been learning about narcissist behavior from friends who when I said this situation to, said it reminded them of their narcissistic ex. It’s scary how some of the stuff I’ve learned match with what I went through. Month 2 of me being officially done with him is coming up (Sept 17th) but what would’ve been our 4 year anniversary is also creeping up (Sept 22nd).

They’re being a genuine angel about all of this, being as helpful as possible but I know I’m being controlling. I know my ex did this exact same thing and it wore down on me big time. \n\nTo make things harder, I have a personality disorder- despite which I am usually very well adjusted, as long as I take the appropriate medication. The problem being, I lost access to my medication a month ago and I can feel the effects tangibly. Violent, self destructive and straight up controlling urges. I keep the large majority to myself but even the small percentage that affect my partner is unsustainable and unfair to them.\n\nHas anyone else found themselves being overly distrustful of your new partner after leaving your wayward? How did you reign in that behaviour? Or did it destroy the relationship?",

I don't know how to feel it's a mixture of feeling horrible for my mom and feeling like a bad son all in one. being extremely sad and being upset and angry towards my dad. realizing just in 2021 he was on another woman other than my mom makes my heart stop. but at the same time i would do anything just ask my dad why and have one more chance. i don't know what to do i'm a 28 year old male i can't afford therapy ",

      "selftext": "Three wks ago I went to a week long event with my partner. At the event my partner’s ex was there. He was there with his spouse and children. My partner and their ex have had very little contact for ~20yrs. The ex broke it off and went fairly no contact for a long time. Eventually they became connected over social media but contact was limited. My partner was very nervous to see him. They went for a few “catch up” walks and every time my ex returned to me she was considerate and checked in with me. It was only on the last day that their final walk made my stomach turn. \n\nAfter we returned home my partner started to be in more consistent communication with her ex (as well as the ex’s spouse whom she also knew from 20 yrs ago). I voiced my discomfort and my partner was very responsive about making me feel “safe” etc. (I have a terrible ex that cheated on me and played all kinds of awful mind games and my partner witnessed that hell I lived thru). Essentially my partner said all the right things but my gut is telling me something is off. \n\nThen a couple days ago my partner had a fairly intensive medical procedure and a few things cropped up that are confirming (I think) reasons for my uneasiness. If she hadn’t just had this procedure I would probably bring everything up ASAP but as is I’m holding back at the moment because she is still very much in physical recovery and healing. \n\nWhat would you do if you were in my shoes? My game plan was to try and relax and note the red flags if they surface and… discuss in ~five wks or so when her healing should be complete. But I’m afraid I’m going to catch wind of something that will be so difficult to compartmentalize. Welp.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "selftext": "My boyfriend (24M) and I (24F) have been dating for 10 months. We went long distance in July and I recently came to visit him last week. I never once thought he would ever cheat on me because of how much he loves and cares about me. We have had one big argument/discussions before regarding our incompatibilities but he was always able to make changes for me. But this time when but I came back to visit, I just had a weird gut feeling and so I went through his texts. I saw that he had texted some escorts inquiring about their services but he did not go through with scheduling it. I felt so betrayed and confronted him immediately and he confessed saying he felt really sexually frustrated while I was gone and had a lapse in judgement. He said he had never done something like this before and he never went through with seeing the escorts, and thinks he just “got a kick” from messaging them. I broke up with him on the spot and left but he has been begging me to give him a second chance and saying he will change for me. He said he’s aware he has some deep rooted issues that made him make such a destructive decision and even said he’d go to therapy lol. Obviously I’m not going to take him back but I still really cared for this man and seeing him in this state really tugs at my heartstrings. I know it’s crazy to say this after what he’s done but I do feel like he is genuine but I would never be able to forgive him for doing this. A middle ground solution I gave him was that he can go work on himself and seek therapy, but he needs to do it alone and I won’t be here for that. If later down the line he feels like he’s ready and is in a good spot, and still wants to be with me, he can reach out to me but there’s no guarantee I’ll respond. I’m just feeling very stuck and sad now because I would never give him a second chance right now, but seeing him in this state where’s he begging and so desperate makes me feel horrible. Also this was my very first relationship ha.\n\nEverything happened this past Sunday and my emotions have been up and down. We met up once to talk and called once and now I’m fighting back the urge to call him. We have been texting once a day and I’m tired of sending long blocks of text and would rather just call to get it over with. But I also miss his voice and I want to call him so bad but don’t know if I should. Any advice or words of comfort would be very appreciated as I’m navigating this. Am I prolonging my healing journey by still responding to him? Is there any hope for us in the future?",

I made guidelines for us to be able to continue our relationship including: no contact with AP, an open phone policy, counseling either couple or individual, and being honest when I BP have questions. \nWhat I'm not sure about is the fact that after I had decided to look through his phone,  I found out WP was still in contact with AP. And after he cut contact I noticed he had unblocked potential APs and was possibly looking at their profiles. I admit I may have overreacted when finding this out and I think it deterred him from wanting to share his phone because since the last time I've done it he has changed his password and hid notifications. I've tried to explain that it's unfair that he expects me to heal when it seems he's clearly hiding things, WP makes excuses like he's got embarrassing things he doesn't want me to see, or that he wants his privacy. I have brought it up that even when I ask what WP has on his phone and he answers, that because of how many times he lied that I cant trust his word without proof and he refuses. \nI just want to hear others opinions on whether its unreasonable for me to ask for his phone? Because my opinion is that its only keeping the pain alive and relevant.\nIm just tired of bringing it up and him telling me that it feels like a step backwards when we end up arguing about it over and over when it feels like he's not willing to work with me on this, I am just hoping that maybe hearing opinions from other people may help us , as I do plan on having one more conversation about it and possibly showing him this post.\nIve had lots of time to think, and this will be my last attempt at reconciliation. \n",

      "selftext": "6 years ago my grandma married this man. He has been horrible from the start. Unbelievably rude, angry, and more sexist and racist than any old person I've ever met. Only ever talks about sex and money, says the raunchiest things... Just gross overall. \nHe is 100% a complete narcissist with severe personality disorder. He truly does not have a single redeeming quality. His family won't talk to him, he has no friends, and no one ever wants to be around him. I could go on for ages but hopefully the message gets across.\n\nLong story short, we recently found out he has been with another (younger) woman. He is giving her over 30 grand a year, paying for her daughter's college, and bought her a condo in Florida. This new woman is a con artist and using him for money(she has been convicted before) but he thinks they're in love. \n\nHe claims that it is just a friendship and nothing is going on..... but has no idea we found hundreds of texts proving otherwise. -- Him confessing his love to her over and over, sending nude photos, and saying he is going to get a divorce to be with her. \n\nMeanwhile, he is telling my grandma nothing is going on, he loves her, and she's the only one.  \n\nIt is so crazy to watch him have a conversation with my grandma telling her how much he loves her, and then immediately run upstairs to text this other woman that he's going to get a divorce and that my grandma is crazy. He talks bad about my grandma with this woman and makes fun of her. They were even looking up my dead grandpas immigration papers for god knows what reason. Just a whole mess. I wish I could explain the extent of what this man has done. It's just one of the craziest cheating situations I have ever seen.  \nHe even had the audacity to ask for time to make a decision(while still denying he has ever slept with this woman). Obviously my grandma told him he doesn't not have any sort of grace to make a decision in this situation... it's baffling to me that he would even ask that. Anyways, I can go on forever because this story is crazier than I can ever explain. \nBut basically I want to get him back. So if anyone has any ideas on (legal) ways I can just psychologically mess with him that would be great. Because he deserves more than I can ever deliver. \n\n",

      "selftext": "Since I don't have anyone else to talk to because it would cause a great mess - here I am. I'm currently 9 months pregnant (little one should pop out anytime) and around 2 months ago I've discovered that my husband was sexting with people since the beginning of our relationship and during our marriage. I don't think he ever did anything physical with anyone but I'd definitely rather not to know. \n\nThe feeling when I found out just slammed me in the most brutal way. And considering we had a very active sex life and my libido is pretty high as well so the lack of sex definitely wasn't the case. I have decided to give him time to confess but he decided to lie to me and cover the lies with more lies... \n\nUntil one day he was bluffing telling me to check through his phone. Okay. I showed him what he apparently thought was hidden and he was mortified. He immediately said that these photos were meant for me and he closed the topic. After that he left for a bachelor's party for 3 days leaving me completely miserable. \n\nAfter he came back I asked him again and he confessed this time. He said it was only once bla bla. Lied again. I gave it some more time and I have shown him the videos sent to him by other women dating back from when we got engaged. Literally days apart. Then he said he apparently forgot about it? He didn't delete anything by the way. He broke down. He started to apologize and how he knew it was bad and that he'd do everything to improve himself. He also gave the explanation that he was feeling insecure and this apparently helped him to boost his ego? Like what?\n\nBut unfortunately I'm not the kind of person to believe bs like that. I mean if you ain't done with your h*e phase just don't consider starting a family and making a baby? Anyway it's on me now. I moved countries to be with him. Left my family and quit my job. Now expecting a newborn... Just AMAZING. In general he's very supportive and good but what he did is something I won't ever be able to process and be fine with it. Plus if it happened it will happen again. For me it's done. \n\nI'm so sorry for my grammar and the messy writing but I just need to vent somewhere otherwise I'll go insane. ",

      "selftext": "So I know I just posted a super long thing yesterday but I wrote it out a couple of days ago and I have some more things to add.  We talked the other day after she had her therapy appointment and she said it was a good session.  She also said her therapist said that me getting an apartment is a red flag.  She said that couples rarely reconcile if one person moves out.  Then she told me that she herself thinks its stupid that I am getting an apartment and that it is a waste of money and that I would see that too after I move in.  I told her I needed my space and a place to be where \"all of this\" isn't in my face on a daily basis.  She of course got shitty and told me to \"by all means, keep the apartment then\".  \n\nWell prior to this conversation that day, I went down a rabbit hole.  I went on a fact checking mission.  Verizon doesn't seem to keep track of texts to and from numbers anymore and she's been using Whatsapp so I googled it and it wouldn't show up on the bill anyway.  But, what I did find was call location evidence.  Which tower her phone pinged off of when I or other people called her.  I did check against the days that I knew she met up with him and where and the tower locations matched....so good, I now know I can trust the data I'm looking at.\n\nWhat I found was 4 weekends where she wasn't where she said she would be.  Two of which I inquired about after Dday and she still kept to her story that she was with x friend at x location.  The cell phone bill tells a very different story.  And these aren't just here for a little bit then home times.  These are overnights because the calls ping the towers till 8am the next day.  Another was when she was supposed to be staying overnight with a mutual friend of ours that she recently told me that knew of her infidelity.  So, now I know she has a friend that covers for her.  The town that the towers are in, are the same town that she admitted to first meeting with him and getting a hotel room.  We're all creatures of habit, so it makes sense that she went back to the same town to meet.\n\nShe doesn't know that I know yet.  But it does help me come to my final conclusion that this marriage needs to end.  Now I just need to pull my balls out of her purse and put them back on.  \n\nEarly on after Dday she told me that if I decided that I couldn't make this work then I should find other arrangements till my apartment is ready.  I checked, that was going to be terribly expensive.  So admittedly, no matter how I feel, I felt I had to fake it till I made it.  I don't feel safe calling it the end just yet.  At the moment, I have no where to go.  But when I do, I know its going to suck, I know it's going to be hard.  I know she's going to be a shithead.  What's on the other side, is hopefully better.  \n\nI keep telling myself It will be better.  Let's laugh for one second.  Because in all of this shit, I can at least make a joke.  Sorry, it's how I deal with hard situations.  One of those weekends she was on a \"rendezvous\", I went to a test ride a BMW K1600 because she said I should go do something since she will be away.  So while I was riding my next girlfriend, she was probably riding her ex-boyfriend.\n\nAdmittedly, over the last few months I have been thinking of what my life without her would be like.  What would I do, where would I go?  Our kids are grown.  I can go anywhere....on a K1600.  I've spent some evenings looking at job postings, Zillow and fantasizing about where I could go or would like to go.  I'm trying to keep my eye on the future and not get bogged down in the current crap pile. ",

Their relationship didn't survive, but they still in contact.

      "selftext": "My (31F) husband (30M) had an EA from 2022-2023. At that point, we were together for 10 years. We've been married for almost 2 years, but I only recently found out about the affair. I'm also pregnant (I discovered his EA at 7 months of pregnancy).\n\nThey met on an out-of-town work trip of his. He **swears** there was nothing physical between them. However, based on the chats I saw, I'm doubtful. They chatted online for a total of 11 months. There were extremely affectionate messages (e.g., *I miss you so much it hurts*, and *I wish I could kiss you*). He admitted to s\\*xting, and AP sending explicit videos/photos of herself. They shared daily life updates. If distance weren't an issue, I am almost 100% certain he would have gone all the way with her. \n\nOne of the most painful parts about his EA was that he sent her \"I miss you so much\" the day before he proposed to me. He then continued chatting with her right after he proposed.\n\nAt the start of DD, he was trickle truthing. Although shamefully, I fell into hysterical bonding for up to 3 weeks post-DD.\n\nAside from the affair, he admitted to following and chatting random women on social media because \"I don't know, I find them pretty\" (verbatim).\n\nHe also saved a huge number of photos of these women (regular selfies, photos in bikinis, and even in sportswear) -- one of whom was a colleague of mine.\n\nHis reason for all this was that he had *cold feet*, and wanted to know if he was missing out on things before getting married. He claims that he realized that our relationship bore more weight than these flings and fleeting moments of lust/excitement.\n\nHe swears he hasn't done anything of the sort ever since we got married, but obviously there's no way for me to know for sure. \n\nFor the past 2 months, I can say that he's been putting in more effort. He's been listening to me more, and I do feel like he values me / our relationship. But I still cry each night as my mind sends me mental images of WP's conversations with AP. If I weren't pregnant, I don't think I'd actually want to reconcile. Unfortunately, there's not much I can do right now since this hit me out of nowhere. Realistically speaking, I have nobody else I can ask support from. \n\n**TL;DR -** I recently discovered that my husband of 1.5 years (and partner for a total of 13 years) had an affair before we got married. I can't leave him because we're expecting a baby, but I haven't decided if I *really* want R, or if I'm forced to R since I feel stuck.\n\n**Bottomline is,** ***how do I know if WP's efforts are genuine?***",

      "selftext": "My (44m) gf (45f) told me tonight that 6 months ago she gave head to her ex bf in the parking lot of her work. \nWe started dating almost 10 months ago, she immigrated to the US 2 years ago and has dated 3 other men before me. When we started dating everything was good for the first 4 months then she got weird when she told me that one of her ex came to her work on his birthday. She said she talked to him in his car, he was sad and upset, showed him a gun that was in his car that he planned to use on himself because she left him. She said they talked for a while and she kissed him. \nI was a bit upset and confused, asked if she still wanted to be with him, to which she said no, then asked her to cut off contact with him because of how unstable he was. We moved on. Now six months later and we are preparing to go on vacation together for my birthday and she finally told me the truth. \nBefore she met me she was in a relationship with him, he was controlling and abusive. The only time they had sex, he dosed her with drugs mixed in their drink, and took photos and videos of the act. \nWhen she met him on his birthday it was because he was threatening to spread the photos and video online, at her work, and to find them and show them to me. She told me that she didn’t just kiss him, and that she went down on him and is now telling me 6 months after the incident. He has also been calling, and texting her harassing her every day for the last month repeating the same threats. \nThe only reason I found out about this is because I told her that due to the level of harassment I need to talk to the guy to see if I can get him to leave her alone. She has blocked him, but he just creates new accounts, and generates new numbers to call and text her from. So this is what prompted her confession. \nHe has also threatened to get her deported, which he can’t, but she didn’t understand that. \nSo yes she was coerced, and I am trying my hardest to be supportive and help her resolve the situation, but at the same time I feel like something inside of me broke when she told me. I understand her fears and that she was coerced, but she also lied and hid this from me, now I wonder if every time she worked late, every time she took a day trip when she had a day off and I was working. I’m in a tailspin and don’t know what to do. Anyone got any advise, I could really use it. ",

      "selftext": "Okay this is a continuation of last post. a lot of people are saying that my dad will be hurt by me not telling him, and i get it. to be straight, i barley see my dad. he travels for work and only comes on weekends with the exception of sometimes 1 week out of the month where he works from home, hence why it’s easy for my mum to cheat. That’s not to say my mum and him don’t have a good relationship, cause from an outsiders perspective i’d say they do. My dad works in family and divorce law. He works with these cases every damn day, yet he hates any conflicts to do with his own family. I honestly think he wouldn’t do anything if i told him. Trust me i would have told him everything the minute i was suspicious if i thought he would take any notice, but he wouldn’t. It’s a very thought out and deliberate choice i’ve made not to say anything to him. \n\nAnd now you’re probably thinking “well if telling him supposedly has no consequences, why don’t you just do it, what’s the worst that could happen” and i don’t have an answer, it’s just a gut instinct i have that it’s not worth saying anything yet. I also just want to say i am not trying to protect my mum by not telling anyone about it, i am not on her side because i have chosen to keep quiet.. i have remained silent for this time to protect myself and the rest of my family.. i know my family and i feel i know what is right for this point in time. i’m not asking for advice on who to tell and how to do it anymore, i just want to know that i’m not alone in this.. obviously this is not about me, but when you’re the only one who knows about it all, it kinda fucking feels like it is. \n\nAnd just like in any family matter the children are always the ones neglected, even though they are usually the ones impacted the most. I understand a lot of people on here are older and have had fucked up marriages or relationships and you think you know what’s best because it’s what you would have wanted if you were in my dads position, and maybe you do know what’s best.. for you. But try and put your feet in the shoes of a child who is witnessing it all from the outside. I am holding a big secret that feels too big to keep to myself but also feels too big to let out all right now. I just want to be listened to. ",

      "title": "Girlfriend of 11 years died of cancer, found out she has a new bf.",
      "selftext": "My girlfriend of 11 years just died a couple of days ago due to the complications of cancer.\n\nFor the most part, we had a very loving relationship, we grew our careers together, we had a vision of where we want to be in life and we even planned on what we want when we grow old.\n\nWe do have fights, there were suspicious parts(on her side) that shook the foundation of our relationship a few times but we went past that. One of which was when she wanted to end things because she was tired due to the pamdemic but we were able to fix it.\n\nLast 2024, because of her family issues with money, I got frustrated and said that we should probably break up, but after a few days, I talked to her because I can’t let her be alone with her family because of their issues.  We got back together, but for some reason she don’t want to update her side of the family about this.\n\nHer reasoning was that, now that I am out of the picture, her family may think that she doesn’t have too much money anymore that they won’t ask her for more money(I help her with some of her bills and give to their family too)\n\nShe loves her family still despite of these toxicity issues.\n\nWe went and travelled to a different country afterwards, I felt like we were really happy.\n\nThe start of the year 2025, she had to go to the E.R. Because of stomach pain, after a few tests, we were informed that she has cancer, we then proceeded with the treatments.\n\nTreatments were done in a different country as the cancer is rare and the medicines are not available in our country.\n\nShe had to undergo immunotherapy, while not as debilitating as chemo so there’s not much downtime, she went thru with it without me and her family’s help, she rented a place there.\n\nUnfortunately, immunotherapy didn’t do much so she was planning on moving back to the country and check what the doctor’s next plans were. During this time, whenever we video call and ask her if I can visit to help her, she was angry and didn’t want me to go there. She the told me that during those times when she was in treatment that she wasn’t happy with me and that we should probably break up.\n\nIn my mind, I thought it was just the cancer speaking since I figured she wanted to do things on her own while she can so I respected that, we still do communicate because I was helping her with some of the costs and paid for some cash loans.\n\nWe do have a property together so maybe she was thinking that I’ll just subtract everything that she owes to me but so far we still weren’t able to sell our property.\n\nLast week, I was still be able to talk to her and videochat. But at this point she was crying because she is in pain. I tried to ask her if I can visit and she just got mad so I dropped the subject as I don’t want to stress someone who is battling her mortality.\n\nThen I received the bad news, a couple of days after she passed away. I asked her mom if I can visit her. After a few days, I got into their house and saw her. I’ve been trying to keep my emotions during my flight but I broke down when I saw here in a casket. I never envision something like this in my entire life, I cried my heart out.\n\nAfter speaking with her mom, I interacted with some of the people in the house, and one lady asked me if I knew the guy sitting in the room, this is where my emotions went ape shit, turns out it was her new boyfriend that she met while having treatments in a different country.\n\nAt this point, I wasn’t angry for some reason, I just thought I will giver her a pass at this because she was dying and maybe want to experience different things.\n\nSo I talked to her mom and some of her siblings and I told them that I didn’t know and they also didn’t now that we are still together. I asked if I can just leave and go somewhere else, btw they arranger her room so I can sleep there. The new boyfriend was sleeping in a hotel near the house where the wake of my late gf is.\n\nI feel so alone because I’m stuck in the room and I don’t want to go outside for now because the new bf is there and I want to respect my gf’s decision. So I only go outside when he is already not around. He will also not attend the actual interment as he needed to flew to his country\n\nHaving mixed feelings as the family wants me to attend the interment on Saturday. I’m still here and always wondering the whys, when, where but I can’t get the answer anymore as she is already gone. What did I do wrong, why didn’t I deserve a final goodbye, while I am not perfect, I poured my heart and soul to take care of you but for some reason I am still not doing enough.\n\nSorry for the long post. Just wanted to get this off my chest.",

Proudly proclaiming his new Instagram highlights of different videos of him… meanwhile it’s to get the attention of someone else. \n\nIt’s just heartbreaking because you know you can’t do them like that in the same selfish, premeditated manner. I look back at our texts & pictures from when we first started dating and wonder what changed? How could the same sweet boy who proclaimed his love for me turn out to be such a cold hearted monster. \n\nWhile I won’t get back the time I’ve spent trying to make sense of it, I find some comfort knowing this wasn’t some callous mistake. It was a choice, he made over and over again. A choice & temptation I never gave into. Which is more than enough of an answer for me.  ",

The two knew of me and didn't care about our marriage. (I am mad at him too, I understand it was him who ultimately allowed it) but the last girl was absolutely vile with me. I had confronted her initially wondering If she'd known he was married on IG when i found out who she was. She said she knew, and after pleading with her to stop seeing him she told me she didn't care about my feelings or our marriage. She later when he refused to leave me for her sent me explicit photos of them and told me that I was a horrible person for sleeping with her bf, she told me to hurt myself cause i was worthless...  we were still married and yes I told him and he didn't care she spoke to me this way... more rage. \n\n I left him many months ago and he moved in with her, he still tries to talk to me and see me...but I have this deep rage and angry horrible thoughts towards her and him....I feel so hurt and angry at the wrong of what she did and there is nothing i can do about it. I cant make him leave her or see her for the seductress she is but i hate that she got away with it when she wronged me. I don't want to feel this way nor care at all what he or she does. They both are not worth my time but I'm so livid and never felt this mad for so long before.  \n\nI want to let it go and move on fully just feel like I am alone in these emotions. Anyone else feel this way or supportive tips? \n\nThx",

We had been together almost 4 years, 2 year married almost all long distance appart from 3 international travel (2x 6 weeks and 1x 5 month across the globe). Her EA and PA was for the 4 last month of our long distance, last meeting the very last day before getting done with the distance.No kids\n\nI've been through all the phases and différents emotions.  She was first handling very badly, trickled truth me until I could not find anymore proofs on her device. AP mocked me after I contact him to verify her last \"full truth\" and refused to tell me anything. She had not blocked or cut contact with him even if he was in another country.  She was extremely defensive and blaming me for weeks, refusing to take therapy and rug sweeping. After 2 months of me not letting her any of that she started turning around and expressing more sincere regret and culpability. She has been saying and doing all the good and right things. \nBut nothing change for me, I'm still as sad, scared, confused , angry, ashamed, insecure as the first day.  135 days of feeling that way, without any progress or end in sight. \n\nThe dissrecpect of her lies and manipulation and lack of humility and honesty just feel too big for me to pass it someday and love her the way we both deserve to experience love and mariage, without grouge and with respect and trust for each other. I go angry and insult her few times each week, I hate that version of myself.\n\nThat why I told her today that it finish, that I'm going. I'm so uncertain and sad and confuse and I might go back on my decision in the next days or weeks. But I need a real time of seperation that I don't think honnestly would make me want to come back from that. But who know I guess. Maybe it is not farewell and just the start of a no contact. But that mean long distance again and I don't trust her + her WHY is exactly because long distance was not possible for her anymore even if she alway loved me and only wanted to be done with long distance....\n\n\nI'm so fucking confuse and not myself",

      "selftext": "My husband and I have been together 7 years, married for 6, and have 3 kids. He was always emotionally closed off, more distant than me , but I thought that was just how he was raised. I brought up separation a few times over the years because I felt disconnected, but he always convinced me I was the only one he wanted and he would do anything to keep me happy.\n\nTwo months ago, I found out he had been regularly cheating. It started with an ex that I was convinced he would never go near again (she's a mess, they made a lot of bad choices together, and their relationship in general was something he always claimed he regretted).  However, he’d secretly stayed in contact sporadically throughout our entire marrige as they worked in a kind of close proximity and would meet for breaks. They had mutual friends and ran into each other while at someone's birthday party, which led to the first physical interaction and another followed shortly after. The physical relationship stopped as he moved somewhere else for work but they stayed in contact through snapchat. Finding his secret snapchat account is what led to me finding out about the physical cheating. Once I discovered that, he admitted to other physical affairs, a porn addiction, and hiding sexual preferences he was too ashamed to share. All of this information was exposed to me in about a 20 minute period when it was something I never even thought he was capable of. It was the first relationship where I fully trusted my partner and never questioned what they were telling me since they hadn't given me a reason before to not believe them. So it felt like my whole existence was ripped out from under me and I couldn't tell what was true. \n\nSince everything came out, he’s completely changed. Therapy has helped him realize where his shame came from and how to deal with it in a healthier way. He has a better understanding of his reliance on porn and how that became a link for fantasies leading to his shitty behaviors.. He’s more emotionally open than I’ve ever seen him. I realized there's so much about himself that he's never told me or anyone else,  either because of shame or never wanting to burden someone with his trauma and feelings. He's always been the funny and helpful guy that never says no.\n\nAnd that’s where I’m stuck.\n\nI feel closer to him now than ever before, but also more triggered, angry, and heartbroken. Sometimes I want to leave for good and that thought brings me peace. But sometimes I feel like if he was my best friend before and we made it through slumps, then how great could the marriage be now that I actually know him and have a genuine connection? But the thought always comes back that he couldn't have loved me if all of this was happening. That he wanted to make sure I didn't leave because he was scared he would never find another relationship or didn't want to be alone. That I was just what made him feel safe and normal. \n\nIf you’ve been in this situation, as the betrayed or the betrayer, I’d love to hear:\n\nWhat helped you rebuild trust (or decide not to)?\nHow did you separate who they were from who they are now?\nDid anyone regret staying? Or regret leaving too soon?\n\nFor those who stayed: how did you stop seeing them as the liar? Did the tained memories that you once smiled about, ever feel that way again?\nFor those who betrayed: did you lie out of shame? Did it ever really change? And why hold on so tightly to a person that you knew you would eventually hurt with your lies instead of just letting them go before the pain?\n\nAny insight helps. I feel like I’m drowning between who he was, who he is now… and trying to move past the previously good memories that my head just views as lies now.",

I was with her when she was sick and we were going from hospital to hospital for scans and check ups. I did the same for her sister. I helped her sister by taking everyone to the airport when they were moving back to their country. Every decision I ever made I first thought about her. I turned down job opportunities better than I have now because I thought spending more time with her was worth more than any money I could ever earn. I spent every free moment I could just wanting to be close to her. And I believed her when she told me that all the rumours were fake. I didn't even need her to love me back, she sometimes treated me like shit or straight up told me that she's not capable of loving anymore. And I didn't care - I just wanted to be around her and love her with all my strength. And then, once I had some strong suspicions I checked her phone and found videos of her having sex with a coworker she swore on God she had no relationship with. Now I still have to work with both of them and I can't think about anything else. A bunch of other coworkers know and everyone has supported me but it still hurts like hell. Even now I know everything I would give anything in this world to be able to go back and have her never do this so that we could be together. I don't hate her - I just can't ever look past what happened.\n\nDo you ever stop loving a person even if they hurt you?",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nYou guys have been incredibly helpful, my gf of 6 years cheated on me, we have been NC/Broken up for about a month. I’m still in pain but moving forward. Out of the blue I ran into a girl in my local town and we got to chatting a bit, she is in an open relationship, looking for a FWB, and me and her casually talked for a bit. I am conflicted, on one hand, I’m still so upset over being cheated on. On the other hand, I feel like I MYSELF am “cheating” even though I broke up with my cheating ex. I know that I might be looking for an unhealthy outlet, but is a casual FWB really that unhealthy? \n\nEdit: the night went great, I spoke to her BF and confirmed, he’s 100% cool. She was a great time. She knows my situation and is totally cool with it.",

      "title": "Bipolar girlfriend emotionally cheated",
      "selftext": "Well this is a rather long and sad story but I will try to keep it short. My girlfriend and I are together for 6 years+. I felt in love with her pretty soon after meeting her and started dreaming about forming a family with her. During the first year I started noticing her having mood swings and after struggling with this she agreed to go to a psychiatrist. She was diagnosed with bipolar 2 with mixed affective disorder. Back then she was upset she found some messages I sent to my ex, though it was nothing romantic. Long story short, she accepted it was nothing romantic there and started going to therapy where she figured out she wanted to continue with me. She also started the treatment for bipolar so things got to be more calm, our intimacy improved and her moods were much more manageable. After starting to have side effects from the medication, she stopped the treatment even though I told her I was scared her moods will come back. Stupid and less mature, I did not look into what bipolar means. Turns out it gets worse if untreated and most people who manage it well take medication all their life.\n\nThe years that followed turned from bad to worse. My life turned into a constant effort to navigate her moods and not trigger her. Every time I would bring up her moods she would say she is much better. Our intimacy started to suffer and it was a constant subject of debate. For me it was the most obvious thing pointing that there was an issue so I always pushed to fix that. That put more pressure on her while dealing with her untreated bipolar and she grew to resent me. Sometimes we had sex when she would be mostly absent and even if I was not feeling well I went on with it. I tried bringing it up after but she would find excuses.\n\nThroughout the relationship, I behaved like a gentleman and gave her full trust. Trying to plan for our future, cooking fancy meals, breakfast in bed, flowers and pretty much anything she would ask for. Unknowingly I ended up having more of a caretaker role and not getting much in return. Depression took over me more and more and she actead mean when I tried to tell her I am being hurt about her actions and that it feels she is pushing me away. Though even under these conditions, we managed to laugh well together and be good friends, in a way. \n\nFast forward to this year, her condition got so worse that she had episodes of depression lasting up to 2 months. A month after she agreed she is basically fucked up and needs treatment, I found her messages with an online 'friend' from another country (first time in 7 years looking in her phone). Mostly small talk but I saw one sexual message from her and one from the guy. It was on Snapchat that deletes some of the messages so I didn't see the full conversation. She says he reached out and started making more explicit complaints. She said she enjoyed the attention from someone who doesn't know she is sick. She also said she used the guy 'like speaking with chatgpt' and she was exploring why she doesn't feel sexual lately. \n\nTo make things worse, my mother was present when I found the messages and she found all details as I had a full blown meltdown...\n\nNow we are sort of on a break, still exclusive to eachother but not together, kind of a limbo situation. She did admit all her emotional abuse she did  over the years and she justified it with her bipolar, childhood trauma and not being open in communication because she was not good with herself. Remember me seeking closeness and intimacy? She said, and this was a huge shock, that now she started going to therapy and she realised she felt as if she was raped. She said she did give consent and she knows I didn't do anything malicious but that's how it felt. Using that word crushed me even with the mentions after... I found it to be abusive in a way though I did say I am sorry she felt this way. I also asked not to use the word rape as it literally gives me a panic attack. \n\nNow she says she wants to work things out and to show me she can be different. She started going to therapy and is on the path to get medicated. \n\nI am 30. I feel I am still young and I might regret not breaking up. I have a good job, confident in my looks and honest so I don't think I would do bad in the dating world. \n\nHowever, I was not able to say done, I am ending it. I started taking antidepressants which took some pain away but I am very confused. Do I run? Do I give her another chance? Does staying means I will be insecure and jealous? Idk what to do... I would appreciate some advice on how to reach a decision that I am happy with.",

      "selftext": "I’m in my early 40s and my husband is too. Married 12 years, with an 11 and 8 year old. We’ve been together 24 years. Early days the relationship was heaven. My first real relationship and first love. he had just come out of a 2 year relationship with his HS sweetheart. \nHe has cheated on me more than once with his HS ex (early years in our relationship), cheated on me with a pregnant colleague of his (with twins and married), had a secret tinder account from 2016 to at least 2022 (out of curiosity to see what it’s like out there he says), has kept in contact with his HS ex, I found nudes if his HS ex in our house, and in Feb 2025 reached out to the ex-colleague after an argument we had stating we were headed for a split, reminiscing about how irresistible she was, how he’d love to do yoga with her, was disappointed she didn’t live in town still so they could hang out, and how crazy his wife(me) is. Oh I also found a hidden camera in our room in April…it had been there for weeks. He tried saying the hidden camera was to see if masturbated because I wouldn’t tell him if I did. Forget about paying ppl online for porn, that was in the mix too. \n\nWhen confronted, he displayed no remorse other than “sarry” with a shoulder shrug and that I was over reacting. I’m so hurt and angry…when I express it he minimizes all the things he’s done and has basically told me I need to process and deal with things on my own. Whenever I try to talk to him about it he says things like “I can’t handle your crazy today”. I get so frustrated trying to convince him why his actions hurt me, he minimizes which literally makes my blood boil. I can’t even be around him….his presence makes me ill….and we just had relations over the weekend, before I read these message exchanges with his ex-preggo coworker from Feb and feel so dirty and disgusted with myself for even letting him touch me. \n\nIn addition, there has been physical abuse…that resulted in CPS being called. He bullies our kids, especially our son. His anger over stupid little things with the kids and having such high expectations of them is over the top. Our littlest said they have a hard time keeping up with what’s going on with us (parents) and that they think maybe we should divorce - again at 8 yrs old not a full understanding of all implications. The kicker is that he just became a full fledged lawyer so he likes to pepper some threats in there for good measure. You’d expect a certain level of emotional control and decency from someone in that career. To the outside world he presents as a loving involved father…inside our house it’s very different. If he wants to be good he can be great it’s just that I don’t even see any glimmers of that anymore…all just nastiness…and if he’s not nasty he’s on his phone, constantly, playing some game and god knows what else. I haven’t had access to his phone since January. I thought he couldn’t access mine but he must’ve gotten my passcode bc I saw an email about our kids activity sent to him at 5am one morning when I was asleep. So months of him having access and finding nothing bc I’m not that person, and his phone has been on lockdown. When I snag it he panics, runs to grab my wrists forcefully to let it go so he can get it back. \n\nI’m truly at a loss. Helpless. Hopeless. Like I wish I wouldn’t wake up tomorrow. Feeling so many emotions and not sure I can keep fighting for something that he disregards and abuses. I feel like I’m the one he’s punishing for the shitty choices he’s made…as if the trauma hasnt been enough. I have been the primary income earner since 2019 and supported him through law school in a different city - so single mom for 3 years basically. I feel like there’s been no appreciation other than actual words of “I appreciate that” but actions all show otherwise. \n\nWhy is he doing these things? Will he ever mature and change for the better? The emotional trauma and pain I’ve experienced and continue to experience with this person is unreal. And now at the point where it’s truly unbearable. \n\nI fantasize about what life would be like with a partner who’s never cheated on me, betrayed me or violated me.  I crave that safety and security in a relationship. ",

Bugged my truck with a GPS and has lingered around my house while having her own space (apartment) because shes mad i filed for sole occupancy.\n\nI came out of Menards with the kids last night and a cop was there waiting. She called thinking im unsafely transporting the kids. Im not sure what angle she is trying to take to get dirt on me. Including threatening drug tests on me and my brother, any where i take the kids. which isnt a problem. Its just all craziness all the while wanting me back.  \n\nThe AP has not reached out to me, probably since I put the fear of God in him. But has threatened to not pick his kids up and quit his job so she cant collect her child support she is getting to be able to refinance the house under her name. \n\nMy STBXW is still expecting me to give her another chance and texts me endlessly and honestly gives me an added amount of anxiety, playing on family any of my faults etc.\n\nAs far as me and the AP's wife we have still been having a good time talking.  Vibes are good and the only red flags are who our STBX's are. There is another part of me that doesnt want a long term relationship with someone with kids. It might sound selfish sense i have kids but I never asked for this to happen and taking on another persons kids seems like so much, maybe for the right person plus im still so early on with all this maybe I havent fully processed all.

      "selftext": "My boyfriend made himself out to be the most loyal, kind, caring, and adoring boyfriend in the world. After the cheating and abuse I dealt with in my last relationship, when I met him I felt like I was so lucky. He was even a huge support system for me healing from the trauma my previous relationship created for me, ironically. But like most things, it was too good to be true. We've been dating for a little over a year now and I found out he's had a secret reddit where he would lust after other women, exchange nudes, request their snapchats, and even try to meet up with people (he swears he never did anything physical or ever met anyone in person, but boy oh boy did he try to based on the messages I've seen). This went on for months. The subreddits he was on and the names of them are disgusting, and he was even messaging significantly younger women that some of these subreddits seem to target. He also had Onlyfans, and was tipping and subscribing to models (one of which he knew from college, YAY!), even though he's owed me money for the past few months on top of that. He also was calling around looking for escorts and weird exchanges at massage parlors while I was away on my last work trip. But how this all was even possible is so confusing, because I sleep at his house every single night and we do everything together. It looks like most of this stuff would happen in the middle of the day, on his off days while I was working or even during his work days. \n\n  \nIt's been baffling to find this all out, because all the while this has been going on he was being the most affectionate partner who always reassured me, always told me how beautiful I was, and we had no issues at all with intimacy or closeness or excitement in that regard at all. He would talk negatively about my friend's partner's who had cheated or who he felt were being bad partners. He would laugh with me and say he hates men for how stereotypically creepy and scummy they often are. He was also always super protective of me and insecure about other people looking at me and he always needed a lot of reassurance too. He's always asked \"are you sure you want just me forever, you promise?\" And he's told all my friends that he's going to marry me one day. His ex apparently cheated on him, and for a long time I thought we were bonded over helping each other heal from similar struggles. Even my friends are absolutely shocked about his secret behavior. I'm at a loss for words most days.\n\n  \nHe tells me he's mentally ill and thinks he's bipolar. He said he'll start therapy and get on medications. He says he feels like two different people and whenever I try to confront him about specific things he's done, he says he doesn't know why he did it and he wishes he had an answer for me because \"that isn't who he is.\" I know most people on reddit tend to just yell 'break up' and in this case, that makes total sense. But I'm trying really hard to work through this with him somehow. \n\nI need resources on coping and moving forward if anyone has any suggestions. Thanks :(",

      "selftext": "TLDR\n\n3 weeks ago, wife admitted to an affair.  Said it happened twice then two weeks later said it didn’t but she counted it because she went with the intention and couldn’t go through with it.\n\nStarted last october i noticed one weekend after vising family she was different when i returned home.  Said my lack of sex drive was driving a wedge between us.  News to me, I thought things were good.  Later gave another reasoning that she feels she carries the mental load like when we should start a project and what project is next…..there’s always a project.  \n\nThe 9 months following that time in oct have been filled with arguing.  Sleeping in separate rooms.  Her constantly texting her ex BF from highschool (#3).  She has said “how can we keep living like this and do you want to keep living like this” but never came out and outright asked me to move out.  She wants me to say it.  I saw a message between her and #3 that said “ I would start by cuddling” and her response was “that would be a good start” with a hearty face and kissy face after.  I admitted to checking her text messages 15 years ago and seeing a message from one of her old “friend” (#2) that said “you were pretty good last night”.  She constantly said she can’t get past the fact that i checked her phone, never mind the message I saw.  Claims she can’t remember what that was about.  Says I never trusted her but for several years of our relationship/marriage we lived separately because I had to move for work (not a lot of jobs where we live) and the next job I traveled a lot and I never worried about what she was doing.\n\nThen I hear the first negative thing about #3 saying “and you think there’s something going on with my friend who is…..emotionally unavailable.  \n\nThen 3 weeks later she admitted to the affair.  Since then she won’t let me sleep when she can’t sleep.  I have applied for an apartment and it won’t be ready for another month.  She has said things like “if we split it will destroy our family”.  “This is going to devastate the kids”.  The kids are all over 25. “ If we can’t figure this out then I guess we’re not as strong as I thought we were.”  “I wish I never fucking told you.”\n\nI have started therapy.  She has started therapy with the intention of us doing couples therapy later.  I don’t know where I want to go from here.  I have no sanctuary.  Work and home are both stressful.  I want my own place so I can clear my head, think, reflect and decide what is next.\n\nHistory:  Been with this person for 20 years, married for 10.\n\nOk, let’s start at the end and then we’ll go back to the beginning where I saw a change.  A few weeks ago my wife confessed to me that she had an affair.  She said she slept with this person 2 times.  Actually she didn’t say the words.  I was away with her son (my step son) on a weekend trip with his family when she sent me a text message on the last day telling me to come home as soon as I can, “we need to talk”.  Immediately I had a feeling I knew what the “talk” was going to be about.  On the way home we chatted small talk on the phone and decided to go to an annual event in a nearby town because it would be fun and I’m all about avoiding these kinds of things so…let’s do that instead.  While there she let out a big sigh and I asked if she was ok.  She said no, she said she “fucked up”.  I asked how.  She said “by being human”.  I made some funnyish comment about how none of us are perfect because we are human, ignored the situation and went on to enjoy the event.  We got home and she asked if we were going to discuss it or were we just going to pretend nothing is wrong.  So I asked how she “fucked up”, she gave me a “look”.  I said with who?  She gave me another “look”.  The look was because she knew I knew who she was talking about.  I had been suspecting things for months.\n\nSo, now let's go back in time and talk about the events that have happened.  First off, my wife is very private about her phone.  Snooping is huuuuuge no-no for her.  I now know why.  So let’s get into it.  Last Oct my wife said I should go see my family in another state because my Dad isn’t getting younger.  I jumped at the chance because it’s been so long since I got to visit them alone.  I got to day drink with my cousin.  It was fun!  Haven’t done that in a while.  \n\nThe day before I head home:  I am on the way to visiting a mutual friend and we (wife and I) chatted on the phone for a few minutes and then she said “ IIII gottaaaa goooo  I’ll talk to you later”  in an ornery voice.  I could tell she had a shit eating grin on her face when she said it.  Ok, no big deal.  That night I’m with my cousin watching tv and I call.  No answer so I send a text saying hey, if you’re up, give me a call.  I noticed later past 1am she hadn’t looked at the message.  Odd, considering that she can never sleep for shit.  Usually she would see it and text asking if I am still awake.  The next morning we talk on my way back and she was very different in how she talked about our future.  She was planning on talking to her financial advisor and it’s usually “we, us” type of stuff.  So that was how I was talking and she said “well…. You never know what the future holds”.   Ok, weird.  I mentioned that I didn’t hear from her and she said she went to bed early and slept all night.  I get home around 2pm and she sleeps all day.  More weird.  A day later she tries to initiate some play time and I have a failure to launch which is upsetting but does happen from time to time.  I make sure she gets hers and we go to sleep.  Bothered by my situation I made an appt with my Dr. the next day and told my wife about it after I get home.  Her response was “you know that has been driving a wedge between us”.  No, I had no clue.  This was out of nowhere to me.  In the days that followed she said she “feels numb”, “she can’t put a finger on it”, “she can’t seem to put words to how she feels”.  I did feel all of this was weird so I checked the garage door because it has a history and we use the garage door like anyone else would use their front door.  I noticed that night I didn’t hear from her, the garage door only cycled once (open and close) in the early afternoon and it didn’t cycle again till the next morning, right before she texted me to see if I was awake.\n\nI notice over the days that she’s texting a lot so I happen to peek over her shoulder and see that she’s texting an ex from her high school days.  Let’s call him #3  No biggie, I knew they kept in touch.  It never bothered me before.  Then I notice she’s texting with that ornery look on her face, every day, multiple times a day.  So I questioned it, I asked if anything was going on and she said “when do I have time for an affair?”.  I said, well, I was gone the other weekend.  She snapped.  In my opinion she over reacted to that comment.  \n\nA month later she was shopping for a dress for an event we planned to attend.  She said she had the perfect one that she ordered but still wanted to look around so she chose to go to a store that was not nearby.  She decided to get a hotel room and stay there overnight.  Turns out, it was midway between where we live and where #3 lived.  I still haven’t gotten confirmation that they met at that time.  She hasn’t admitted to that yet.  But it seemed odd and she was adamant on going alone.  When I suggested driving her there she made a big deal asking if I didn’t trust her, etc….  After she returned she seemed distant.  She insisted on sleeping on the couch.\n\nEventually after a couple weeks she gave me reasoning for her questioning of our marriage.  She says she carries the mental load, she decides when we start projects and when things get done.  Which is true.  Things I cover with autonomy are laundry, cutting the grass and working on the cars.  I do all of our own maintenance.  The 2nd reason is the one mentioned above.  My drive doesn’t match hers.  She could do it once a day or multiple times a day.  We do it once a week and I thought that was normal.  We’re always in the middle of projects or cleaning the house and it’s nothing for her to start reorganizing a closet at 11pm.  I want to go to bed and by the time she wants to be intimate, it’s late and I really just want to sleep.  Probably 2 or 3 times a year I will have a failure to launch, I’m not young so I thought it was normal.  Also I’m not getting as hard as I used to, again, thought it was my age and weight.  She said I should be able to go multiple times in a night, multiple nights a week….etc…\n\nOver the next few months there are a lot of sleeping in separate rooms, or when she did sleep next to me she would sleep on the other side of the bed.  Before, she always slept right up against me.  The texting with #3 continued and of course I was curious so I would try to peek over her shoulder when I could.  I once caught a glimpse of her sending a kissy face and hearty face and it made me wonder.  The next time I noticed it she left her phone open face up on the chair so I got up to get her dinner dishes and have a peek and #3 said “I would first start with cuddling”, then she replied with “that would be a good start” with a kissy and hearty face after.  I tried to let it go but she could tell I was bothered so I confronted her and asked what that was all about.  She said “ I hope he was talking about his wife”.  Then she continued to make a big deal about it saying how if I don’t trust her, then we have nothing, etc…  It was an argument that lasted hours.  Weeks later she brought up my jealous streak and how I don’t trust her and mentioned the text message.  I told her that wasn’t just normal conversation.  She said he was having a bad day and needed a hug………ok…..  A couple more weeks go by and she brings it up AGAIN and I again, questioned, how does that conversation start.  You’re not talking about gardening here, why the hearty and kissy faces after his comment???  So she finally admitted that she was ashamed and that it was an inappropriate text message and that she stopped it right there and she said it never should have got to that point…..ok finally we got somewhere.  \n\nAt a later time, she brings up another “jealous streak” of mine.  We’ve had a few weird times in our relationship.  She brought up one of them from over 16 years ago where we were on a “break”.  I was planning to move in with her at the same time my housing situation was going to dissolve.  She felt she didn’t trust that I was moving in for the right reasons so we took a break.  She started hanging out with a guy that she met in the mornings to get her tea that showed her attention.  We will call him #2.  She would go to #2’s house till 1am and she swears nothing was going on.  So she used this time to point out my jealous streak.  So I fessed up to the last time I checked her phone, it was after her communication with him ended….or so I thought.  We were living together and I had to go out of state for a funeral.  When I returned she was acting weird so I was young and insecure so I checked her phone and saw a text message from #2 that said “you were pretty good last night” and her response was “we probably shouldn’t do that anymore”.  Then a day or less after she was frustrated with me about something, maybe she was hangry, I don’t know but she was doing something on her phone and I asked what she was doing and she said “deleting text messages”.  This was 15 years ago.  I was young and insecure and figured if I had confronted her about it she would just say that she set that up to see if I was looking at her phone.  So I buried that deep down and carried on.  So this was the next thing for her to make a big deal about now.  Over the weeks that followed she said, “I can’t believe you checked my phone”.  I told her it was a long time ago and whatever it was, it was in the past.  I only brought it up because she was bringing up #2.   She said, “I can’t get past the fact that you looked at my phone”.  She said “I don’t know what that was even about”.  I said well I highly doubt you were playing Crazy 8’s and he thought you did well.  She got defensive and said “what are you accusing me of???”  So my natural response is to back down.  She would use that as an example of why she thought I never trusted her.  I reminded her that we spent a few years living apart because of work, and I never worried.  I would come home every other weekend and visit her and the kids (we don’t have kids together, we each brought a kid into the relationship and they are both older than 25 now.)  Over the last several years I had a job where I traveled very frequently.  I was never worried and I always trusted her.  If I didn't, those situations would have been impossible.\n\nOver these recent months while we would argue she would say “do you want to keep living like this?”  “how can we keep going on like this?” but she would never say the actual words “please move out or please get an apartment”.  I looked, I had one that I was going to apply to and I lollygagged and missed it.  All the while deep down, fearing change, wanting to work things out because I didn’t get married to then run when things got hard.  One night we argued and she said she was trying to make things work and get feelings back and I said that I was too.  She threw it in my face that I was looking at apartments and said “yea, you’re looking for apartments, you’re trying real hard”.  \n\nThis has been going on for 9 months till she admitted what was going on.  The last few months I started pulling away and started thinking about my life without her.  I had to, I wasn’t seeing progress.  She always just found something “she couldn’t get past”.  What did it for me was the text message I saw 15 years ago and her response to me admitting that I checked her phone.  She was mad that I looked, nevermind the message that I saw.  And to this day she still denys any wrong doing, she claims she doesn’t remember what that was about.  I felt I was being played with.  I am her emotional yo-yo and the string had started to break.  The texting with #3 continued, I just let it be, didn’t say anything.  Every day was a new “my friend #3” story.  Telling me about his life and his marital problems.  I remember one time I made a smart remark about #3 and she said “excuse me” as if to defend him.  \n\nThen, a few weeks before she admitted what was going on, I heard her say her first negative thing about #3.  It was something like “and you think there’s something going on between him and I…..my friend who is emotionally unavailable.”  As soon as I heard that, knew that some point in the near future she was going to suddenly want to work things out.  Because I am reminded of her time running around with #2.  At one point she eventually wanted us to work things out and and I asked what about #2?  She said he wasn’t looking for the same thing.  This was also around the same time that I started pulling away.  So, now to me it looks eerily similar.  Maybe she thought she had a future with #3 and started to see differently so…..well, still have my obedient husband waiting in the wings….\n\nOne other thing she said recently was she mentioned that he would never leave the area he was living in.  She said she bets that he has a side piece up there that is keeping him there and the tone she used was somewhat bitter.\n\nSo after she admitted it, I applied and got the apartment but it won’t be ready till mid Sept. \n\nThe 2nd night I went to bed without saying goodnight.  She came to bed being loud to wake me out of a sound sleep and said “I see you went to be without telling me……I never should have fucking told you.  I never should have fucking told you.”  I tried to ignore her and go to sleep.  She wouldn’t leave me alone.  She kept pawing at me, pulling me close to her.  Eventually I gave in and kissed her and we had some sad playtime.  The next time I told her I wasn’t in the mood.  She said she understood and SIGHED and rolled over.  The sigh gets me, when she does that I know she isn’t happy.  Early on, I learned to respond to it by giving her what she expects.  Then she’d roll over toward me and try again.  She won’t leave me alone so I give in.\n\nPSA, for those who aren’t “as good as they used to be”, some viagra and a cock ring can get you having sex with the woman who cheated on you and you can see it in your head during sex and still perform.  Just an FYI.  Give that shit a shot.  \n\nI feel like I have been dragged through shit for 9 months and then to find out my suspicions were correct.  Now I feel like she basically rubbed her friendship with #3 in my face for the last 9 months.  Now she suddenly wants to work it out.  I am the man of her dreams, etc….She once asked if I was sure I needed to go to an apartment to get space and I said yes.  Later she thanked me for holding my ground.  But, she still continues to question it, saying I am running away from our problems and that we can build back our relationship stronger than before.  She also claims she’s been asking me to move out for months…..no she hasn’t.  She just said things like “how can we keep living like this”.  She won’t say the words like she’s playing some legal game.  She talks about how guilty she has felt but she continued to text with #3 and still with that ornery look on her face, telling me stories about #3’s life.\n\nSince Dday she’s said the following things:\n\n* If we cannot work this out then I guess we weren't as strong as I thought we were.\n* She said that I am running away from our problems\n* She said that if I don’t want to work it out then I need to find another living situation till my apartment is ready\n* She said we need to work on this for our family\n* She keeps asking what are we going to tell the kids\n* She said that she’s been telling me for years about our intimacy problems.  That is false.  I always apologized when I didn’t last as long or for not being as hard as I used to be, she would always say “you’re perfect”, “do you hear me complaining” and one time she grabbed my face and said with conviction “did you hear me complain???”  So I honestly thought it was fine.\n* She’s talked to friends and their husbands always initiate projects so she’s compared me to others.\n* She said part of my charm is my free spirit but it’s a double edge sword because it’s also what irritates her about me.\n* This week she admitted or said the 2nd time never happened with #3.  She said she counted it because she went with the intention.  Not sure if I should believe that.\n\nShe's concerned about her son’s reaction to our separation because he and I are very close.  I am too.  I love that kid.  He’s as much my son as my son that has my dna.  We really aren’t planning on telling them the details.  I think irreconcilable differences will be the story for now.\n\nSince Dday, I have started seeing a therapist.  I don’t know how I feel besides being angry and betrayed.  If I had to make a decision now with a gun to my head, we’re done.  But, I still love her and want to give it a shot for some reason.  I’m stupid.  I know.  Maybe I’m scared of change.  Maybe I am scared to be without her….even though she has been manipulative.  Then there’s the history.  You’ll notice there’s #2 and #3.  I haven’t mentioned #1.  Early on in our relationship she started talking to another Ex bf from highschool.  We will call him #1.  One night I couldn’t sleep and came downstairs and found her on the phone with him.  Then she came to bed super horny and initiated play time.  Then later in another conversation she mentioned us having a 4-some with him and his wife.  I said I wasn’t interested.  There was some weird behavior and I saw that her email was open so I looked and saw an email from her to him saying how it felt good to be in his arms again.  I confronted her about it and she said nothing happened and that they met up and talked about old times.  Maybe I am naive but I don’t believe anything happened that time but still….looking at our history.  I feel like she’s always looking for something better and I’m just the old comfy slippers.  It’s pattern…..and I’m getting too old for this shit.  I want someone who loves me for me.\n\nOne other detail about #3.  While I was away the weekend of Dday, she had gone to meet with #3, she said there was talk about getting a hotel, then she said she couldn’t do it.  She shared the text conversation with me and I don’t remember the details but he seemed upset at her saying he knew what he was doing and he wouldn’t call what they did an “affair.  Then a couple days after Dday she told me #3 had texted her and she told him that she told me everything.  She has told me that was their last contact.\n\nI’m sure there’s more details of things said but, looking at what I have typed….it’s a lot.  I feel like shit and do not know what to do.  I haven’t sorted through that yet.  I feel like canceling the apartment would be a mistake.  I think I need my space to think and reflect.  I can’t do that with her in my face everyday.  I have no sanctuary.  That was lost over the last 9 months.  Work is stressful.  Home is stressful.  I need peace and a place I can actually get some sleep.  When she can’t sleep, she makes sure I can’t either by pawing at me or pushing up against me…etc….  If I were to decide that I am done and I have cancelled the apartment then I have to start all over again.  And as mentioned above, she would expect me to find a place till my place is ready.  Right now, I’m not feeling optimistic.\n\nShe was a little upset that I started seeing a therapist without the intention of US seeing them.  So now she’s seeing one with the intention of me joining at some point.  She was sure to tell me that her therapist raised an eyebrow to me getting an apartment and thought that was weird.  But before WE see a therapist together, I think I need to continue my counseling to sort through my shit.\n\nThings she’s done right:  She told me I could talk to my cousin about our shit.  I didn’t tell her how much I told her but I told her all my suspicions and what I saw.  Since then, she came out and told my cousin of her affair.  She said she did it because she wanted me to be able to talk to someone.  I think she’s trying to be accountable but given all the above, I have concerns she’s not as genuine as she is playing it off to be.  She says she had nothing to gain by telling me and also nothing to gain by telling my cousin.  Not sure how to read that either.\n\nI have no clue what to do.  What is right, wrong or where to go.  I spend my days fantasizing about moving away.  That is where I am right now.  I constantly feel like there is a blender in my lower chest, angry, lost and I just want to disappear.\n\n\n\n",

I crashed out for a second and then I told him I will not leave him and I will stay. I am lying it’s only because being apart from him is very painful and I don’t think I can handle two pains at the same time. I know I am not going to marry him or be with him in the long term because he cheated 2 years ago and I forgave him. This time I can’t but how do I deal with not having him in my life. He was a walking green flag I swear he treated me like a queen always listening to me and validating me he really was my comfort person whenever something happens or when I think about something bad happening I will remind myself at least I have him by my side and now I don’t have that person. How am I going to date after this? I will be comparing every thing with him because he was so perfect for me like I felt seen every time. Sorry for the rant but anyone could tell me some advice I am not ready to confide in my friends because they told me not to get back with him. Thanks ",

      "selftext": "Since I broke up with my partner after discovering his infidelity, I can't stop hating being single.  I feel it the most at night,  in bed.  I have no one to give me the physical and seemingly emotional comfort at the very end of my day,  to drift off to sleep with.  I miss it so much. My sleep has been terrible for the last 4 months. I hate that by choosing myself over his abuse and selfishness, I've isolated myself from my favorite form of intimacy, and I don't know how to begin to replace it. I was very happy in this relationship (or so I thought at the time)  and did not want to be single.  But I couldn't accept the reality they were hiding from me.  I couldn't tolerate forgiving them again,  not once it was clear they were broken themselves,  and couldn't care for me the way one deserves when they are actually loved.  I spent three years \"taking it slow\" with this guy, and I thought I was being smart and building something solid and dependable but the whole time I was making it all up.  He didn't do the things a man does when he loves you.  He didn't try to build anything that I wasn't already creating,  and he didn't want to care for me the way I cared for him.  So why do I hate that I'm free of that?  Why can't I be happy to be alone for a while?  Why is it so unfulfilling trying to be enough for myself?  I feel disconnected from others now.  I feel like I'm not interesting to anyone and why should I be?  I'm sad and lonely under all the jokes and outdoor adventures and social activities. I feel like I'm out of sync to find love.  I'm 43 now,  and the dating world is not as kind to me anymore.  I'm being shown that my value has gone down.  I'm having to compete for attention from men before they make an effort to know me. I don't know how I did this before and I don't feel like trying very hard anymore. \n\nYes,  I am depressed. No,  I can't get therapy.  I just want to stop being angry that I'm alone,  and I don't deserve it. I want to be able to sleep at night.  I want all the security I thought I had with them.  I just don't want them. It's not fair. ",

      "selftext": "I (22M) have been with my girlfriend (22F) for almost 2 years now, but it’s super rocky and unhealthy, and I’m not sure what to do… it’s a long story but I will try to make it short, we met February 2024, she was talking to others as was I at the time, but about a few weeks after she sat me down and asked if we could be exclusive, meaning talking to no one seriously and focus on each other. I set my boundaries, she set hers, we agreed on what cheating was and we both agreed on everything 100%, especially her. Things were awesome, we were like best friends and did everything together, 2 months later I wanted to make things official and she was on board in April! I had been going through something with my old best friend that I knew for about 16 years and stabbed me in the back for almost 2 years at that point and knew I could’ve landed in jail for a little bit. She knew about everything I was very open to her about it, and she was open to me about everything in her past as well. She comes from an abusive father growing up and I came from a mother who had BPD and always told me to never trust anyone, and I’ve also had a bunch of instances where trust was broken between friends and partners. \n\nFrom being with my girlfriend I had always told her I was scared of getting cheated on and that was my biggest worry because I was head over heels for her, she would always tell me she’s not that type of person and that she would never do that to me. (She had physically cheated on her first relationship boyfriend because he did and he was abusive, and then emotionally cheated on her second relationship) I had always taken her on dates, opened doors, gave her flowers every few weeks to replace the old ones, and just thought I was doing the best I could, she has told me that I’m have a very hard time being sweet and showing an emotional side (empathetic to her) and that she needs a sweet side. So I agree to try and work on that. \n\n\nWell fast forward to October of 2024 I find out that I’m going to get sentenced to jail for 45 days, I tell her and we are both super upset and sad, I made a promise to her if she would remain loyal and show support I would make her the happiest alive, the day of my sentencing I ask her if she wanted to break things off so that we wouldn’t have to deal with this in our relationship and she absolutely said no and was firm. The day of my sentencing I go in, I call her everyday to check up on her, more than my supportive family.. and then 10 days of me being there, she isn’t answering the phone, which is weird because she would always update me if she would be busy or not. I try calling at least 20 times because I’m worried, and she finally answered a couple of hours after the first, I have my suspicions and the rest of the week I keep pushing about why she didn’t answer. \n\nShe finally had confessed to going over to a guys house she used to talk to before me and that nothing happened… my heart sunk to my stomach and I felt sick. I tried to take time to think and tried to tell her that nothing will work until she tells me everything. She says that she told me everything and that nothing happened (I thought was bs)  and that she accepts the fact that I would leave her because she knew how much she has messed up and destroyed me. fast forward when I get released I find out on a location app that she went over there twice, 2 days before she didn’t answer all of my phone calls,  (she had to work almost all day that day) I confront her about it and she said that it was true, and that she was going to tell me everything when she got off of work! She denies that she slept with him, even after I confronted the dude on social media and he admitted they did, I’m not sure but I wanted to believe her, our relationship was super unstable and rocky where there was no trust. But she says that she’s telling the truth and that everything is out.. fast forward 7 months after the incident we start going to therapy and comes to me one day after a huge argument and says that she told her therapist something that I should know, she says the day I called so much she had seen my calls just watched them ring, I asked why and how many times she’s gonna bread crumb.  \n\nShe breaks down crying and reveals all of it saying that they did sleep together 3 times over the 2 days and so many other details, she said she doesn’t know why she did it, and that she was lonely and needed someone because she knew she couldn’t have me because I was locked up, said she also wanted someone who was sweet and emotional with her (feed her stupid delusions) and she needed somewhat closure because they ended things too fast, she’s all over the place when she tries to explain why she did it. I was just dead inside.. I didn’t know what to do so I left, she didn’t ask for me back, she didn’t beg, she didn’t ask for forgiveness. A week later I tell her how I felt and what she needs to do to gain my trust back and how we can move forward. She has a very hard time staying on top of things and hard time putting any effort into fixing what she did. I’ve been stuck on what to do and hate her for what she did, but also get pulled back in on our good days and love her so much, but everyday I bring it up, and I call her names and the fact that she cheated, she says she doesn’t want to be with me anymore because I treat her like shit because of what she did. \n\nWhich hurts me because at the beginning of all this she said she would do whatever it takes to keep me and work on her problems, but she’s done very minimal work and effort to repair anything, I keep having to remind her. When we break up I’m so hateful towards her and want nothing to do with her, then about a week later I want no one but her, I just don’t know what to do and want some help or better insight from others. I just don’t get why she said she would never do that and agreeing to each others boundaries to me then end up doing that to me a little bit after 5 months of being together… ",

Over the years there's been a couple instances of confirmed EAs, but there's one that haunts me from within the last two years. She has to work with alot of guys at auctions to bring in what produce they don't grow to sell locally at their market. There's been some conversations I've saved (yes from snooping) and yet to show her because I do not have solid proof of a physical affair. I've confronted her numerous times that I think something is going on, but it's always denied/downplayed. The main thing I've confronted her on was her snapchatting with another farmer (who was recently divorced). She claimed it was just business talk, to which I responded that you don't do business on a chat that deletes! She since deleted SC. I have seen some concerning texts from one of her friends that illuded to there being some sort of relationship going on between my WW and the protentional AP. Things have died down with this AP, or they're using some other means of conversation. \n\nI love her a lot and I put in a lot of effort at home, watching the kids while she works long days/weekends. My effort is noticed by many (her family) but not her. I suggest counseling but that causes a fight. My concern is that deep down she has a cheating tendency, and that scares the hell out of me since we have three young kids. ",

      "selftext": "Rewind back to 2019 when I (34m) came back from my deployment from Iraq to my (34f) now ex-wife, things were really weird. People talk about losing the connection,)  talk about how hard homecomings are are, but this was just different.  We talked almost daily, kept active with my kids, and there was never anything that was a red flag while I was gone. \n\nWe didn’t have sex for days after I came home and that was just the start.\n\nAt the time I had an app on my phone that was a vault for secret photos. I had had this app for years as most immature young men probably did and stored photos of naked chicks that I had spoken to, or connected with prior to our relationship. She found this prior to the ceremony and still moved forward on, marrying me anyways which I’m about to mention. We’ll come back to this. \n\nA few months after I came home, our wedding ceremony was planned (we married before I left), and then two weeks after the wedding ceremony I caught her kissing another man in our basement at a party surrounded by ‘her friends.’ \n\nEveryone said I was seeing things, and it didn’t happen. Oh it happened. \n\nThrough this, I was able to find out through a close girl friend of hers who had unfriended her shortly prior due to a ‘fight,’ that she had been cheating on me the entire deployment. This girl dumped everything on me. This man who was in the basement had actually gotten her pregnant and they decided to have an abortion and had I’m sure this is because it would’ve been proof of her cheating. (We’re Caucasian, the other guy was African American.) but anyways the secret relationship was completely undetected by anybody except for myself and her two close friends.\n\nShe had a falling out with that friend, and she felt bad for everything that I had been put through that I didn’t even know about and decided to tell me everything. Not only had the cheating occurred during the deployment, but it also went back years to past bachelorette parties and vacations she had taken with a girlfriends. The news just devastated me.\n\nOne weekend she went away with a friend to the ocean, and when she had returned, she confronted me about having a women be in the home. This was after the wedding, after I caught her kissing that guy, but before we officially separated, this was the straw that broke the camels back. Since she had found that photo of all on my phone, she had been acting like I was the one who was cheating on her. She was always questioning why the bed looked funny why a window drape would be open and it drove me insane. When she came back from this weekend trip, she said that she had placed a camera in the home and that she had caught me on video with another woman. \n\nShe needed something to pin me as the bad guy in all of this so she could get away with her double life and cheating. The problem was had she actually had a camera up, she wouldn’t have seen anyone in the house because I went to a friends to watch movies. Knowing she was lying and trying to get me to admit to something that didn’t actually happen, I played along to see what her reaction would be, and to see what her intentions were as far as divorce or taking my kid that we had together, anything. \n\nSo I lied and said she was correct that I did have a woman over and she lost her mind. She talked about how faithful she had been. She talked about how good of a mom and how she took care of everything while I was gone on deployment and how I was never gonna see my son again.\n\nOnce she was done telling me all of the things, she asked me if I had anything to say, and I said “ are you done yet?” she went quiet. I then went on to tell her that she was actually lying in all of this and that she didn’t have a camera. \n\nNeedless to say she took what I “admitted “ and ran with it. She made up an entire narrative of me being gay, me sleeping with guys overseas, all sorts of things. \n\nWe separated, and during the separation, she placed hidden cameras in my private living space and recorded me being with other people, including a guy, and then proceeded to go to all of my friends and family, and tell them that I had been cheating on her with a man. She used any video she captured or any audio or things that I said, and showed them to everyone and said I was a cheater. Keep in mind no one knows that we’re not even together at this point, and she had even moved out.\n\nWe went to divorce court and the court ruled that what she had done was considered “revenge porn.” Since this was family court and no criminal court I would’ve had to go to the police station and file for criminal charges, but we had a four-year-old, and I didn’t want my child being raised with his mother being a “registered sex offender “or spending time in prison. So I didn’t press charges.\n\nLooking at her, disgusts me because I know that she lives a double life. I know the new boyfriend that she has she’s doing the same thing. Living the single bachelorette life with a kid. (I won 50% custody and she pays me child support by the way.)\n\nAt the end of the day, I should feel good that I got out of this rather unscathed. Where it’s taken a hit mostly is with my friends and family. A lot of people aren’t sure what to believe and I’ve lost a lot of family friends. She is still friends with all of my old friends from high school because their wives decided to side with her. No one even turned around to ask me my side of the story. Nobody realizes that they’re surrounding themselves with a fake person living with double life.\n\nI always thought that I would grow up with my childhood best friends sharing memories of our kids playing together. I may have won in court. I may have won child support. I may have exonerated myself to the legal system and to my close family, but she’s taken a huge part of my life and it’s just vile. And I know those people probably aren’t really my friends to begin with if this is the true nature of them not even giving me a minute of their time.\n\nAs we grow, relationships change and friends come and go. I just didn’t realize or understand or even think that this would be the reason why and it’s just hard to wrap my head around sometimes. My child comes back from her house and is always telling me who he was with, and always mentions seeing my old friends and at this point it’s almost numb.\n\nI often think about sabotaging her life and sending out new wedding invitations with her photo shopped with the guy she cheated on me with to both families or writing some incriminating social media post or doing something to get vengeance, but I just can’t bring myself to do it. I can’t even bring myself to write a text to my friends and ask them why. Why didn’t you ask me about any of this? Why did you straight up abandon me without any thought?\n\nAnd there is so much more to the story it would really make a crazy Netflix series if you ask me.\n\nSitting on this sucks and I just wanna stop thinking about it forever. But I can’t. What should I do to ease my pain on this? ",

Recently things have been better, but she found out that I paid for content on OF. Not much, only 25£ but, still. \n\nI owned it, apologised and have been trying to put as much effort into the marriage since as possible. I also lost my job but that's all sorted now. In short, stressful 6 weeks!\n\nShe said she accepted it was a mistake and is processing it. Things have been OK since. Then, 2 weeks ago, she spoke really badly to me over some housework. I communicated how it made me feel, calmly using what we have learnt in therapy. She told me to get out so I left for the evening. \n\nShe apologized over text that evening, but in the morning, I explained that I needed more than a txt message (she has a history of struggling to genuinely apologise). Ever since then shes given devoted no time to resolve it, brining up the cheating regularly, insulting me and saying outright lies. I've really struggled with this and she has basically made no time or effort to resolve this fall out. \n\nIn that time, I've had to think about the marriage and whether I am happy. At the start of counseling I said I needed three things: reasonable discussions, increased intamacy (it has been a problem for years and it is not new) and to try and patch up her relationship with my three kids (who do not live with me and the separate relationships I have been having over the past few years are making me very unhappy).\n\nWith exam results, arguing and going on OF, this has brought my issues into focus. I am not happy here, but love her very much. She is my soul mate and best friend, but I don't feel it from her anymore. \n\nI feel that I'm being accountable for my mistake, but I see it very much as a symptom of our marriage - not the main problem. It's not her fault that I did it, all mine, but all I want is her affection and intamacy. I even forgot I had the account/images! I want her, not some shitty porn, but keep getting rejected. \n\nAny advice as I'm getting nowhere and feel that I may have to leave? I don't want to (and not sure what she wants either), but I'm just getting stonewalled.",

My mom and I had to compromise a lot on our dreams and desires because of his bad financial decisions; we still do it to this date, and it seems like he never learns from his mistakes. I used to argue on his behalf with my mom, but now I feel guilty, in fact, sad for doing so. I want to confront him, and I don't know how he will take it, but I can say that our relationship will never be the same again. Any daughters or sons who have faced it or are facing it, would you like to share your experience on how you managed to handle this? ",

      "selftext": "It's Saturday night, two years ago. In a few hours, your world will never be the same again. \n\nIt's going to be OK.\n\nThe dog has been acting funny around the kids' sports coach. He's lodging over the road, and has been coming over for dinner more frequently, recently. Your wife changed her phone passcode a few weeks ago, and you just realised what the code might be. \n\nYou'll head back from a family birthday dinner. Everyone will head to bed. Your wife of 17 years will pop downstairs. You'll look through her phone, through the force-archived WhatsApp chats. There it will be. Reams of emoji-soaked, kiss-sodden messages between your wife and this imposter. You'll place the phone down, mind racing. For months that follow, you'll wish you could have had a poker face when she enters the room. But you're human, and you'll go slate grey. You'll ask calmly whether there is anything going on; she'll deny it, aggressively. You'll ask her to pass you her phone; she'll nuke the chat on the way. And then she'll go on the front foot, ploughing into you, denying everything, and expressing outrage that you could even begin to doubt her. She'll take the phone and go to sleep in your youngest's room. It's going to be OK.\n\nThe onslaught, the gaslighting, will continue the next morning. How dare you accuse her? And then, with misplaced cockiness, she'll defy you to find anything on her phone or her computer. In the few days that follow, you'll go on a scavenger hunt that makes every five minutes its own D-day. Scoping hotels, secret meetings, long chains of messages, erotic lyrics, revealing photos, a confession of love on your own wedding anniversary. Death by a thousand stabs to the heart. Nothing will be denied, but nothing will be volunteered. And everything will be put back at your feet as a consequence of your being too busy with your job, the kids, the dog. You'll file for divorce within a week. It's going to be OK.\n\nA week later still, the AP will head back to his home country. You'll crumble and agree to give it one more go. The hysterical bonding will last all of two nights, the insomnia 18 months. You'll drop 12 pounds in two weeks. But it'll be OK.\n\nIn the months that follow, you'll do individual counseling. Your counselor will listen, and press the bruises, gradually testing where you are in the process. You'll begin to realize that far from giving your wayward another chance, you'd been given another shot at making her happy enough not to stray again. In your shellshock, you won't be able to respond as she connives at rehoming the dog - ironically, with one of the unwitting friends she'd used as an alibi. But it'll be OK.\n\nYou'll learn so much about yourself, about healthy relationships, realizing that even if the affair drove you to counseling, then what you learned there was ultimately going to lead to the divorce. In couples counseling you'll learn more about what a healthy relationship should look like. A fresh start is coming, with your wife or otherwise. But it'll all be too much for her. She will dive back into to drinking, confecting her own version of things and confiding it even to your own mother. \n\nIn the end, one summer's night, nearly a year on, she'll stay up late again, drinking alone, phone in hand. You'll come downstairs and see this, and the last year of triggers will collapse into an infinitely painful pinpoint.  A fresh scan of her phone will reveal something new - all the ways that she has attempted to diagnose you with every mental malady, any time you've tried to assert a boundary. And then a tsunami of disgust will hit you; you'll know you're done, and that it's time to wrap up the divorce. She'll assume that it's because you've found someone else. In a way, you have - you. It'll be OK.\n\nWhat will follow will be a relief. You'll cohabit, you'll break the news to the kids. You'll want to leave the trigger-tainted village, so you'll find a new house nearer the kids' schools. You'll divide by two, and the courts will rubber stamp everything with nothing more than a typo check. That will go OK.\n\nIt'll be midwinter when you move in to your new home, and the dog will get waylaid at the Rainbow Bridge on her way to reuniting with you. You will assure the kids that the house will get good, and that the weather will get better. And it will. You'll remember how to cook the food you love, and learn that the kids love it too. The insomnia that blighted you for the last decade will evaporate when you turn the key to your new home. You will dance in your kitchen and laugh, and the kids will laugh. They will play with the new little dog in the house, who gets you out, about, and meeting people in your new town.\n\nLong before you finally commit to writing this down, you'll have forgiven your ex-wife for what she did, but have moved on; wishing her well, but wanting no more of it. There will be hope. There will be sad days. \n\nAnd whilst I often don't think about it at all these days, even as these second anniversaries of multiple D-days whistle past, I hope that some part of this message reaches you, to let you know that it's better on the other side. And if anyone else hears that along the way, then all to the better - maybe my story can be added to the annals of this great subreddit, which did so much to get me here.\n\nThanks for everything, guys. You made it OK.",

It is weird to have my complex feelings about my divorce and my ex his infidelity come back now that I feel so comfortable and happy.

We are still living together until next month when I will be moving out. In the meantime we keep conversations at the minimum. I am so pissed at her and she seems to not want to start any fight (also believes she was justified still so not so much remorse). In any case... today is my sons birthday. She has requested we do staff as family like going out to celebrate with a dinner etc. I know this is what my son (10 yo) wants to. but... I cannot pretend\n\nShe broke me. I am not feeling well when around her. She is still with the AP and I hate everything about it. One day I miss her, one day I hate her, one day I am depressed etc. It's still early. What do I do in such cases? I don't want to upset my son, it is super difficult for him as well but she did not treat me like family after almost 20 years together. Why should I go on pretend we are still family? If I go, how can I pretend I am having fun or I socialize with her for the sake of my son? How do I stop myself to not say anything about the whole affair in front of my son when I see her and rage/desire mix together? I am lost :S\n\nEdit: Update - Please check my comment also. I told her that I am not willing for all 3 to go out explaining that in her face I see him and I dont want to pretend to act as a family from the moment she did not treat me as one. Not to my surprise she told me I need to see a doctor and that I will cause trauma to my son etc. She claims I do things in a rush and enforce upon my son things too quick for him to bare. All these communication took place through texting. I am fine with myself and I dont feel the need to explain to her any more. I just need to speak with my son. He is a kid and it is not fair for him. \n\nI also \"warned\" her to not have my son anywhere near the excuse of a person the AP is. I don't care for other future partners she may have, this guy was shaking my hand a few months back before I found out while behind my back... Mr nice guy is over and I feel better already with this new version of him (me)\n\n",

      "title": "Infidelity 15 year old relationship",
      "selftext": "I’ve been with the same woman for 15 years. We never married, but she’s been a huge part of my life. My childhood shaped a lot of who I am today. My mom left when I was three, and my dad remarried four times trying to give me a mother figure. When I was 15, he became a truck driver and was gone most of the time. By 16, I was living on my own with my best friend—who ended up sleeping with the girl I thought was “the one.” In return, I dated his girlfriend for a year. Eventually, they got back together and had kids. At 18, my dad kicked me out, and I had to figure out life on my own, during the 2008 economic crash no less.\n\nJust as I was starting to get on my feet and working toward buying my first home, my now-girlfriend reached out on Facebook. She was young, going through a divorce, and we reconnected fast. Before I knew it, she had moved in. Honestly, part of me felt like I had finally won over my high school crush, the “one that got away.” But over the years, I wasn’t faithful. I made mistakes, and that damaged us.\n\nAlmost three years ago, things hit rock bottom. She grew distant, and after pressing her for answers, she admitted she had been talking to a guy from our high school for months and even sent nudes to another man online. On my birthday, she spent three hours on the phone with that high school guy, then came home and asked me where I wanted to go for dinner. That moment still stings. When she finally left, she called me a narcissist and other painful things. I told her no contact unless it was about our son.\n\nThat period nearly broke me, but it also changed me. I experienced anxiety for the first time, lost 75 pounds, and poured myself into the gym six days a week. I got into the best shape of my life, but inside I was still hurting.\n\nAbout two and a half months later, she called saying she had made a mistake. Against my better judgment, I gave her another chance. We tried to move slowly, but within two weeks she had moved back in. The first year was rough—I traveled constantly just to distract myself, spending money I’m still paying off. We did therapy, both together and individually, but the memories won’t leave me. Every year around my birthday, I’m reminded of what happened.\n\nTo be honest, I haven’t been perfect since then either. For a while, I slipped back into old habits of being unfaithful. It’s been many months since I’ve done anything, but the temptation lingers. Meanwhile, she’s gained some weight, and my desire for intimacy with her has faded.\n\nNow I’m stuck in this place where I don’t know if I should keep fighting for us or let it all go. Part of me wants to heal and make it work, but another part feels weighed down by the past and unsure if there’s truly hope.\n\nSo here’s my question: is there a real path forward for us, or should I accept that it’s time to move on?",

      "title": "My GF of almost three years cheated on me and I don't know how to move on properly",
      "selftext": "For some context : My (F20) almost 3 year relationship abruptly ended due to cheating, and I need some advice in dealing with life and emotions.\n\nI had a GF (F25) who for privacy reasons I will call Lena. Lena and I had a pretty okay relationship - we did not argue, we had fun and were enamoured with each other. The only problem we really faced was the fact that I am likely asexual and simply I just did not like engaging in sexual activities. Lena and I discussed the issue and decided to open our relationship, I agreed because I did not want to lose her and wanted her to be happy. \n\nThis is where the horror happened. I had to work a lot at my part time job as a cashier to support me and Lena (since she didn't work or got fired after three months) all while studying at Uni. I wanted to support us, pay the bills and all so I did not complain, now I realize she was using me. \n\nLooking back at this about 6 month long period, I realized how much she used me. I paid for everything, food, clothes, phone bills, ect. Our parents did support us a little, but they do not have the means to pay for everything. \nAll this while she was at her side-piece's place doing god knows what because if her dad knew she wasn't working he'd kick her out. \n\nI had expressed my disdain for an open-relationship multiple times, she always promised that when we move in together we would close our relationship. \n\nWell, we did move in together, and I yet again paid for everything. Remodeling, rent, ect. In short - I spent my savings on this place. A lot of money. \n\nI started noticing Lena's behaviour only when we moved in together (I was working all the time before, so I honestly am not surprised I did not motice before). She and Mary (her side piece) were calling multiple times a day, she was almost always over at Mary's place, making romantic gifts for each other and sleeping while on call with eachother. I had expressed my emotions again and again to Lena. She always chose Mary. When I was sick and asked her to be with me because I needed her - she went to Mary because she had a cold. Just horrible behaviour. I did not have a problem with the open relationship, but we laid some ground rules, including that our relationship is primary and that sny feelings other than physical are considered cheating. \n\nLong story short, after I wrote Lena a letter that expressed all my frustrations - Lena threw me out. Told me to pack my shit and leave. So I did. In the span of a month she asked me for money, talked with me about reconciliation, didn't want to return my stuff, victimized herself and tried to manipulate me into paying for more stuff. Thankfully I did make a contract with her that said she has to return me (sadly only half) my money. \n\nI had recently found out that she had gotten together with Mary like three days after we broke up - while we were still talking about reconciliation. \nIt effed me up bad. \n\nI honestly don't know how to get through this period in my life. I try to stay active and am exploring myself. My life was always so centered around Lena, I wanted her and I to be happy and content. I think I never learned how to be myself in the process. Looking back I see how she manipulated me all the time, undermined me and made me feel like I never did anything right and like I was the villain in every way and every situation. \n\nI just, can't get her out of my head. I loved her with every ounce of my being and I feel like she is still in my head. Every time I see her I ask myself how long was she cheating on me.  I try not to think back to happy moments we had in the past period and how she was probably cheating on me then too. I just cannot get the emotions I still hold onto out of my head. I feel like I do not know myself, do not know how to be myself anymore. Every time I see her I unwillingly hope it's all just a dream. The betrayal destroyed me. \n\nI would like some advice on how to deal with this, betrayal. Because every time I look at her I feel like I am inferior. How she got all and I don't even know how to be myself.\nThank you for any replies. \n",

      "title": "Pregnant, about to give birth anytime soon and found out my husband is cheating",
      "selftext": "I (30F) and Husband (32M) been married for almost 5yrs. I’ve always been vocal to him how uncomfortable I am with him “looking” on almost naked bikini girls on IG. He “tried” searching baby or cats stuff on IG to cover it up but of course it wont fully remove on your feed if you still look it up. Anyways, he’s been resourceful and uses VPN and private browser. At that point, I just tell him “had fun with your marathon”. I’m tired, pregnant with anxiety so just to regulate my emotions for the baby and I try not to react much. But last night, as I use his phone about to search my old FB account (inactive) I found out that he’s using his FB to look up lots of girls. Literally all girls name on his FB search bar. I haven’t seen any dating apps on his phone coz i’ve been checking his phone but he looked up “asian dating site” and “asian girls looking for dating” on FB. Like come on, looking to date like a fcking single man?! He has a Google Voice app which is similar to a burner app. I tried not to make it obvious that I’m furious because my parents are staying with us to help during my pregnancy. I felt so sick, disgusted, and betrayed. I couldn’t stand sleeping next to him and had to sleep in the other room. He doesn’t know that I know. All he knows is that I’m mad out of nowhere because he woke up in the middle of the night alone in the room. I’m getting a headache from thinking about this. Also, I’m 37 weeks pregnant. If something goes wrong when I give birth, I don’t think I want to entrust my baby with him. What do I do? \n\nUpdate for context:\nWhen I say cheating, means looking/scrolling or actively checking the profile of those girls. To me it’s projecting his desire and that’s like small steps towards disaster. He thinks that’s not cheating coz his definition of cheating is having physical relationship/sex. \n\nMy parents are here to help during pregnancy. I don’t want to involve them with this yet to protect my parent’s health. They’re seniors already and still heartbroken/angry from similar situation on my sister’s marriage. Also, we’re Asians (different ethnicity) don’t believe in divorce and would rather work out the problem. So I’m still unsure and don’t want to rush my decision. \n\nCurrently, I’m not working due to my high risk pregnancy. I’ve had 2 miscarriages prior to this pregnancy. So all the financial burden is on my husband. I dont think he has intimate relationship unless he’s doing it at work which i doubt. His everyday route work, his parents during lunch, home. He calls me when his on break or off of work. I get it that he’s stressed/miserable with work but had to stay because of our current situation plus we haven’t been intimate to make sure baby isn’t harmed. But i dont think it’s acceptable to look at girl’s profile on IG & FB and porn knowing I’m uncomfortable with that. \n\nThis morning before he went to work, he was groveling and apologetic. He initially thought I was mad because his Insta feed is a bunch of girls again. I asked him how his search for dating Asian girls is going. He was clueless till the end about his search logs on FB until I pointed it out. He said that it just pops up, so he clicks on it. Yeah, like all those girls just suddenly come up and FB showing you dating pages. He insisted that he loves me and our baby. And just stupidly bored/miserable at work, that’s why he’s scrolling/clicking what pops up. He also said that I don’t talk to him much even when I’m at home, but it isn’t my fault he’s looking. Like, damn right, not my fault. His actions, his responsibility. I couldn’t sleep and was crying last night , so I just told him to go because I need my sleep. He said he’ll do better. I told him I don’t know; he needs to work on earning my trust because his actions and words aren’t consistent. ",

A few weeks later I did a bit of stalking and found out he was with a new girl and then I realized why I was ghosted. I remember her, I now know he was talking to this girl while we were together. I just remember that she flirted with him and he told me right away and told me he shut it down which he didn’t. \n\nIt’s been 3 years now, and they are still together. He’s converted to her religion, made an effort to learn her culture, the music, how to cook, etc. And I always wonder what is it about her that made him change? That made him want to be loyal? That made him stick with her ? Is it genuine ? \n\nWhen we began talking a girl had texted me to let me know they were talking and he kinda distanced himself. I didn’t really care at the time because I had just met him and didn’t have any intention of dating him. Down the line she said they stopped talking and I dated him months after that. He probably ghosted her too now that I think of it. So he has this pattern of ghosting and disloyalty, but it stopped with this girl. Why?",

Regrets? No regrets? Wait a year and see how I’m feeling because I’m fresh off the divorce train? Thanks for the advice!",

I don’t know if maybe he is gay? Though he adamantly says he isn’t and that he does not want to be with a man. I’ve tried to ask him about everything I could and tried to be at least a little sensitive to what his responses were. \nI can’t sleep at night because I worry he’s looking at it next to me and I am constantly stressed during the day. I have called off the engagement until he gets therapy and shows he has some form of self control or honesty but I don’t know what to do in the mean time. Any one else go through this or have any advice? ",

The short version is that both were only emotional and nothing physical aside from “just kissing once” (yeah I know, I know. Not likely) However I have no way to ever know the full truth and extent.\n\nWe stayed together and one positive I can derive from the situation is it has led me back to a relationship with Christ. Or at least a semblance of  relationship where before there was nothing.\n\nThe rage and anger has mostly subsided but what remains is starting to trouble me. I can no longer find joy in hardly anything. It’s like a slow and immense fog of melancholy has engulfed me.  We did therapy both together and separate—and I feel like all that did for me was unlock painful childhood memories. \nThe therapy was a positive for her and her mental health, she has mostly done all she can to prove her devotion since. \n\nShe has a 13 year old that I have raised since he was 4 and am in the process of finally adopting. That’s the reason I stayed, because I couldn’t live with the thought of losing my only kid basically.\n\nI think I do a pretty good job at hiding it from those around me. I haven’t told anybody but one close friend.—mainly because of my pride but also because I didn’t want our friends and family to look down on her. \nWill it ever get better?

From calling me her daughter, she went on to say “you are not blood family, I have to choose my son ”.\n\nMy therapist still asks “where is your anger ? Let’s explore why you feel resentment for the other woman instead of your own ex-husband?”\n\nIf you read my previous posts, I had moved out within weeks of discovering the affair. A local resource for women had found me an apartment and I moved into this beautiful place. I have grown an indoor garden in all these months. I have received many compliments for my professional work. I even went on a couple dates but haven’t found a connection deep enough for physical intimacy yet. Bought a new car. Rediscovered my own identity. I even go for a massage or pedicure sometimes— which I previously could never afford. Only I paid rent, his baby’s preschool fee, all utilities, groceries, and payments for his vehicle. Still can’t believe he betrayed me. There are moments when I feel guilty, sad, upset — I miss him.\n\nMost days now, I am just grateful for my life. There is a lot of peace knowing that I was dumped — she was chosen — and that is the truth of this moment. Accepting this truth brings me closure. \n\nI don’t remember how many weeks have gone by since I last cried for him :) I even celebrated my 39th birthday and didn’t ache for him. \nIt’s so peaceful being in my own apartment.. with my fairy lights and my plants. \n\nLife is better downstream.

      "selftext": "Let’s set this story up. Met my ex at work, she worked for the same employer but at a location pretty far away. She had just gotten out of several very abusive relationships. We have an intense fling that lasts maybe a month with a few months on and off of talking. Flash forward 6 months I’m about to leave my job. Found out she was moving to my location and honestly said fuck it and stayed just to see what would happen. We immediately get very close. Stayed up talking until 2 every night. I find out she got back with her ex. She had been with him for 8 abusive years, but he said he changed. He didn’t and things were worse off for the both of them. She emotionally starts cheating on him with me for months. We eventually end up cheating. She immediately breaks up with him. We fall in love for real. We get engaged (privately at least). We had confided in each other that we both felt like we were the ones that we wanted, and that eventually we’d be married. She ends up on a work assignment.  We don’t see each other for a month. The day before we’re set to finally get to see each other she misses our nightly phone call. Tells me she’s going drinking with co workers. Which I pushed back on (I didn’t like the idea of her being wasted with them) She made it clear it wasn’t up for discussion and I wavered because I didn’t want to be controlling. She ends up making out with my co worker. She waits a day and then tells me. \n\nSo here it is. She cheated on her ex twice. Both times it ended their relationship. Here’s the difference. When she cheated on him, there wasn’t really love. Neither of them loved each other and they knew it. There wasn’t compatibility between them. In all the occasions she immediately came forward with it. Then after wards immediately cut him off. With me she’s sorry and knows she fucked up. She keeps telling me that she was always honest about how much she loved me, which I don’t really buy. I broke up with her. Not really sure what else if anything I can do. So yea just venting I guess. Would appreciate any thoughts.",

      "selftext": "Hey friends, I’m back. I (28F) have been with my wife “Sally” (29F) for 10 years. A few months ago, I found out she was cheating on me with “Jack” (30M). For more background feel free to check my post history.\n\nOld post’s TLDR: Sally and I had agreed to open our relationship under very specific conditions. The rule was that all three of us would be involved together at all times. We even had a group chat for transparency. What actually happened was that Sally and Jack broke those agreements: they slept together without me, exchanged nudes, and trashed me in private texts. I found out by checking her phone after weeks of feeling like something was off and being told I was crazy.\n\nFor complicated reasons, Jack will likely remain in our social sphere. Our couples therapist who we have been seeing since before the affair feels that this genuinely will not happen again, and I should not take away one of my wife’s friends as she is autistic and has a hard time making new . After months of him avoiding me, (I asked to talk in late April) I finally got him to agree to meet tomorrow.\n\nWhat I want from this meeting is accountability. I want to know why he did it, why I wasn’t worth respect, why he kept having sex with me while clearly not liking me and only caring for Sally, why he avoided me for four months instead of just having a conversation with me, and what he thinks “caring about Sally” means when it came at my expense.\n\nI don’t expect Jack and I to be friends again. But if we’re in the same space, I expect him to treat me with basic decency — cordial, respectful, and adult. That’s one of the boundaries I plan to set.\n\nWhat I’m looking for from you all is: •\tHas anyone here ever kept the affair partner around, and if so, how did that work for you? •\tIf you’ve had a face-to-face with the AP, what questions helped you find clarity? •\tIs there anything you wish you had asked but didn’t in the moment?\n\nI really appreciated this community feedback last time, and it helped lead to some pretty incredible breakthroughs in mending my marriage. I’m open to everything.",

She denied it anyway.\n\nThey had been communicating off and on for several years via Facebook unbeknownst to me.  \n\nI first discovered this when wife mentioned her guy friend would be in town on vacation with his family and could we invite them over for a bbq. \n\nI was fine with it.  However, he declined.  Awhile later him and his family were going to be in town and again my wife invited them over for a bbq.  Again he declined.\n\nMove forward to a few years ago, he messaged my wife he would be in town on business and that he would be traveling to our area regularly on business.\n\nThey messaged back and forth about trying to meet for lunch one of these times.\n\nEventually they did.  I sort of mentioned joining, but my wife felt he might take it wrong.  Like i was a jealous type husband.  So i didn’t push it.  \n\nI was however interested in now seeing the messages.  My wife shared them with me, but stated their might be some things in them that i might be a little uncomfortable with.\n\nThe DM’s were pretty infrequent.  Couple times a year.  Mainly catch up and stuff about their families.\nCertainly, some of his could be interpreted as fishing, flirting.  My wife’s however we’re not.  I did ask if my wife she wanted to keep me on the loop on future messages.  She said she did and has since.\n\nAfter they met for a brief lunch, the correspondence mostly halted. Wife said they had a good meet up and that there was nothing uncomfortable.\n\nSince this has all been brought to light, i have never felt completely comfortable. Mainly because of the fact that my wife didn’t share their correspondence from the beginning, his denying our invites, my wife’s hesitancy with bringing me to lunch and the sudden contact disconnect after their lunch.\n\nHe texted her recently being in town again and fishing for trying to meet up.  Wife didn’t entertain it by politely letting him down.\n\nI don’t know if i should be out should have ever been concerned about this situation.  Appreciate others experiences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "selftext": "I've been completely blindsided after 14 years (2 married) with someone I thought I loved. She has had at least an 8 month emotional affair and at least a 6 month physical/dating affair. \n\nShe basically explained it as her having a mental breakdown to avoid dealing with responsibility and pressure of having kids. She said it had nothing to do with me and I'd be an amazing husband/dad in the future. I knew this couldn't work and  told her I wanted a divorce, made her go to her parents with me and tell them herself what she did. I told my friends what had happened. \n\nShe's lost everything, her parents are so ashamed, her friends are on my side and have cut ties with her. She's basically just left with this loser (she said she ended it, but I doubt it as she has no one now) and a couple immature friends she's not too tight with. She's willing to take less money in the settlement as she feels so guilty. \n\nBut yet I feel so bad for her, I get angry as fuck too, but overall I can't stop feeling sorry for her as she has no one and I'm honestly scared she'll do something stupid. \n\nAnyone in similar situation? When did you stop caring for them? When will I wake up without thinking of this situation and being overwhelmed with anxiety? Anybody able to get their life back on track and find someone they love in their mid-thirties? \n\nI think I made the right choice to leave, but I'm so damn overwhelmed and so much of my body wants to go back to her and protect her from the hate she's getting even though it's totally deserved. I'm so lost, can't wait until this shit has passed and my thoughts aren't completely consumed by this. \n\n-Lost",

They were texting almost daily and messaging on instagram/tiktok daily as well. 3 weeks ago I saw an instagram message from her and asked him about it he said she was just a girl from work sending memes and they have a group message. Something felt off so I inquired further and asked to see instagram messages only to find that they were one on one and daily. He deleted all of their texts that day before I could see them and they cannot be retrieved. He gave her a pretty significant birthday gift and says it’s just what they do for people in the office. When I asked about it he lied and told me it was only $15 but it was way more money. She would confide in him her sex and dating life. My name was never mentioned once in any of the messages. “My wife” was never mentioned. \n\nHe denies any romantic or sexual feelings towards this person. He says it was just platonic but if it were platonic wouldn’t I know who this person is and wouldn’t he mention his wife in the messages? She obviously knows he’s married with kids as he has a few photos on his instagram.\n\nHe says it was not to “keep the door open” but maybe just for his ego and since she’s younger and single maybe a sense of nostalgia hearing about her sex/dating life? \n\nI have chosen to forgive for the sake of my family. I love him with all my heart but I also was completely blindsided. I trusted him 100% with my whole heart and thought he was all in with me and our family too. He tells me he is and he regrets it and is doing all the right things but I can’t help the intrusive thoughts…\n\nWas he interested in her?\n\nWas I not enough?\n\nWere WE not enough?\n\nHow are we to move on? I’m looking for a sense of closure that I don’t think I will ever have and that is the hardest part. I want to see those texts so badly but I think it will only hurt more and also I can’t retrieve them. \n\nWill he hurt me again? I don’t think my heart can take it. I get glimpses of the man I loved but if he loved me why did he sacrifice it all for his ego? \n\nWould also love advice from anyone who has tried EMDR because the PTSD symptoms are real. \n\n-heartbroken wife who feels like a fool and just needs to vent",

      "selftext": "My wife went on a girls trip last weekend. We had gone to Mexico prior and had a huge fight where I made her feel bad about herself. This type of fight has happened before and Im an asshole for doing these things. Well on the trip she met a guy at a pool party and they talked and then she left and called me on the way back I think feeling some guilt. Well the next day they happened to run into each other again at another pool party(I doubt it happened like that. \n\nI believe her friends asked him and his friends to come) and they continued to connect. She told me at that point nothing physical happened. Way later that night she was at a bar with friends(3am) and this guy and his friends showed up again. She then said they talked and she went to the bathroom and when she came out he was waiting and then they kissed outside the bar before saying goodbye. \n\nShe said she went back with her friends and the night ended. The next day she flew back home and I picked her up from the airport. The next morning we had sex, was pretty good but later in the day I was using her phone and saw a screenshot of a guy's number with a name. I questioned her kinda of asking if she knew a guy from work. She pretended like she didnt know what I was talking about. \n\nThe next day I confronted her and she said some crazy story that her friend didnt have her phone so she took the number and sent the screenshot but since deleted the message. The next morning she goes on a weird walk in the morning and I watch her from the windows. She's calling someone. The next morning I finally breakdown and asked to see her phone. She was texting the guy and hiding it in the recently deleted texts. She freaks out I break down. She lies at first saying nothing physical but then I eventually get her to admit she kissed him. \n\nWhile this is happening I read through all the texts and nothing crazy or inappropriate it there until right when im at the end he texts at that moment \"Miss you\" I tell her to text him to end it and I watch her do it. I then text him and ask what happened. He finally replies and says it was just a kiss outside the bar. We go to an emergency couples therapy session that day and she breaks down in front of me and the therapist and seems genuinely upset, guilty and remorseful. \n\nShe explains that I shifted on her so much that when this guy made her feel special she liked it. That's why she kept texting him. She has since apologized profusely and hugged me and snuggled with me every night. I have checked her phone a few times since delving even deeper into social media and haven't see anything in a few days. I hope she just kissed and it's over. I want people's opinions here, with what I've said, is it safe to say that things with her and that guy are over? \n\nI have admitted to being a bad partner and am committed to making her feel special again and she has vowed that this was a stupid mistake that got carried away and that she will never do it again. She's been super affectionate and holds me every night. Its been 4 days since I found out.",

      "title": "I’ve been tempted to break no contact… but he cheated throughout the relationship.",
      "selftext": "Hello… I will attempt to explain the back story the best way I can. \n\nMy ex (24m) and I (25f) had been together for just about 5 years… living together for 3 of those years. He was my first boyfriend. On a random day in 2022 I had found out he had been cheating on me since the first week of our relationship with multiple women including his ex girlfriend. It broke me completely being as though he was a completely different person to my face. I also have severe anxiety and ptsd from a few situations in my early stages of life, I am a hypersensitive person. \n\nIt had felt like my world came crashing down and although I knew I wanted to leave I loved him very deeply and couldn’t find the courage to end things. I confronted him and his apology was full of excuses. He said things such as, “my friends would bring up the fact that you were in college and may have been cheating” which was very disheartening. I went against my mind and tried to move on, but I simply couldn’t. For the next 2 years things were very heated and filled with a bunch of screaming matches. On top of him cheating, he began to become finically unreliable. \n\nHe’d know our bills were due and would sit inside gaming for hours of the day leaving me to handle 70-80% of our finances. We discussed me attempting to move on from the infidelity but sadly I kept uncovering more and more of his scandals or lies he’d told me and I finally uncovered. It made it almost impossible to go a full day without us arguing but after each argument he’d come and try to be friendly and shrug things off. He’d never apologize just pretend it didn’t happen and I’d just prepare to go through it all again the next day. \n\nHe would send and receive money from his ex girlfriend… and she’d even send him very endearing text messages about missing him and wanting to rekindle their relationship. The day I confronted him about his infidelities, she prank called his phone urging him to come home to her. It was no way it was coincidental at all. The more I uncovered the more he’d get even more defensive and angrier when confronted. He began threatening that if I wouldn’t move on from the cheating, he’d leave. \n\nI’d be in so deep with bills and literally begging him to go work to contribute, he simply didn’t care. Rent would be due, I’d be short and he’d be very nonchalant and continue on with his routine of playing his game… brushing it off and saying “I’ll go work.” I’d know it wasn’t true. He began to get angry when I would ask him to work some days and say I was nagging him. But it never changed. Until 2025. \n\nEarlier this year we had been clashing really badly. I’d never open up and tell anyone about the things he’d done.. everyone around me thought he was innocent and sweet. He’d always tell me that if I told anyone about the infidelity, he wouldn’t see a reason in staying with me which also factored into my initial decision. I decided to open up to my close relative about how I felt and that same night he snooped through my phone and read everything. I woke up to him moving out. I cried because I was startled but deep down inside I knew what it was about. He wouldn’t talk to me at all. As a person with anxiety I always need to know peoples reasoning behind things… or at least a form of closure so I don’t overthink myself to death. I’ve had a few very jarring dreams about him and I meeting to have a conversation, they confuse me a bit. \n\nHe wouldn’t even look at me or speak to me. He left with no words. It ate at me that he didn’t feel like after 5 years he didn’t at least owe me a conversation. At this point I was ok with him leaving as the relationship had gotten so toxic. He’d spend hours on his game not even acknowledging my presence. I just wanted him to at least explain why he was upset or giving me some sort of closure. He blocked me on everything. It’s been about 7 months and I’ve felt very tempted to reach out.\n\nNot because I want him back but because I still need closure to move on. I do also understand that sometimes no closure is closure. \n\nI need help… as I’ve constantly been in a battle with myself about it. I’m torn, I feel like he didn’t value me then so I don’t want to break no contact just because I feel I need closure. The other part of me wants to know why? Why after he cheated on me and tore me apart, he was the one hurting?\n\nI’ve been torn because I also don’t see the good in a conversation transpiring but I felt it may make it easier to move on. ",

Last year, my husband had been acting strangely…angry, distant, staying out on the porch late at night, not initiating sex, etc.  \n  One night I decided to go through his phone(we have each others passcodes) and boy did I find something shocking. There were Snapchat pictures and videos of him jerking off, showing off a butt plug, f*cking himself in the butt with a massive dildo and more all sent to one guy. Mind you; this man never once gave any indication that he wanted butt play or anything. I ended up confronting him later once both our kids were asleep. That is when he admitted that he was “bi” and had been wanting butt play. Not sure if he is actually “bi” since he’s never kissed a guy and said he doesn’t ever want to…he has gone down on many men as well as been butt f*cked before(not while we have been together) He said he’d been craving butt action for 6 months or more and he ended up finding the guy from snap on some website/forum. He said it meant nothing to him, but it devastated me. I’m extremely glad he wasn’t physical with this person IRL but the videos were graphic and replay themselves in my head often.  We ended up going to therapy for some time and seemed to have been working toward a healthier relationship. \n  Jump to now; once again my husband has been staying on the porch late at night and quick to anger. He keeps saying it’s that he is stressed with working full time, going to school, and the kids. I went through his phone again this morning and found a video in his deleted pictures where he was pleasuring himself…so of course I had to ask him about it. He said he made it just for himself because he was horny…I said I believed him but I’m not sure I buy that.  Then he turned it around on me and asked how often I go through his phone and if I was having doubts/mistrust then I should talk to him. (He told me I could go through his phone anytime I wanted after last years debacle). \n  Sorry for the long post, but does anyone have any thoughts or advice?\n\n",

I separated from him, and about a month later confessed to receiving a nude from his client, and responding back with a nude of his own.\n\nIts not the worst thing ever, but i have always thought we had a wholesome love, and it was so important to me. And he has been as great as he can be in this process - is in intensive therapy twice a week, uncovering his own trauma and self worth issues, letting me lash out as it comes in waves and takes responsibility and shows big time emotional regret and remorse. \n\nWe built such a beautiful life together, have the same plans for the future, and want the same things. Last October, his business we built the last 5 years was doing so well that I was able to quit working mine. Financially, it has been so incredible to start my little side gig passion project and have the time to clean the house and focus on supporting him.

Last week, I found the messages between them from that date (1 month into our relationship) and it confirmed what I feared - they slept together. It was planned (although spur of the moment, but still planned) for her to go over specifically for sex. \n\nI read ALL their other convos and I'm certain there's no other instance of cheating. We were definitely 100% official at the time he slept with her. \n\nI confronted him. I spoke to her. I got the truth in the end form both of them. He and I have had many heart to hearts in the week since my discovery and want to work on staying together. I understand his reasons for cheating, although part of me also thinks it's a shit reason - he didn't feel like he was worthy of me and didn't think I'd stick around long term so he went back to her. (Her being a friend who he had sex with on and off for years). \n\nHe's cut contact with her completely. Swears he would never do it again, not with her or anyone else. But my problems now are: \n1) how do I put the words I read out of my mind?\n2) how do I learn to trust him fully again without asking if he's spoken to her or checking his phone every day?\n3) despite his reasoning being nothing negative about me or our relationship, how do I stop feeling like I wasn't (and maybe still am not) enough? \n\nI know people are going to tell me it's early in a relationship and I should just cut and run now to save myself heartache and sometimes I still think that myself but the last 2 months have been so amazing and fulfilling for both of us. I want to believe that people can and do change. \n\nSo, any advice Reddit?\n\n",

      "selftext": "Recently moved back in with my family because of a stupid mistake I did. Dad got laid off so I guess moving back in kinda worked out since they were financially struggling. However, not even a week after being back my dad catches my mom cheating on him with a coworker.\n\nI don’t know the finer details or how long it was going on, but she also admitted to it shorty after being caught and initially trying to deny it. My dad was unfaithful in the past, he admitted to her back then, shitty thing is that I was there when he would hang out or hit on other women. I was really small then and I didn’t really know any better or had to react to that. As I got older I realized though. I thought less of him for that even if he was upfront about it. Granted my mom probably figured he was being unfaithful.\n\nThey reconciled and stayed together, but I knew it was genuine. The relationship was always rocky for as long as I can remember, it really fucked with my head. My dad basically dated my mom when she was underage and they were both very emotionally/mentally unwell. I’m surprised they stayed together as long as they did. I was an accident so it kinda forced them to be together for my sake. But now I’m 27, 3 younger siblings, 2 of them being 8 and 11, the other 22. And now this shit happens.\n\nI’m actually not surprised but also am? I didn’t think my mom would do something like that, but I also wasn’t shocked when I found out, it’s weird, but I also think less of her for that even if my dad was the one who cheated first. When it comes down to it, they’re both at fault, I’m not gonna take sides, but I’m also trying to be understanding. I already have my own shit going on that I’m trying to get taken care of and now this happens. Infidelity is rampant in my family, it affected me in a way that it disgusts me, even if someone did it way in the past, I will always think less of them.\n\nI guess I just needed to vent and hear others opinion on it. Perhaps how to deal with it? ",

      "selftext": "I recently found out my (F29) ex (M28) of 3 years had been cheating on me with over 6 women, during different points in our relationship. When I found out, there was a LOT of gaslighting and manipulation from his end (there was that even during the relationship tbh). He's a pathological liar and made me question my sense of reality. His behavior went from being a seemingly perfect, loving and patient bf to a cold, cruel stranger the last time we spoke. He just discarded me like he wasn't my best friend just two months ago.\n\nHe's already talking to other people now, while I still get nightmares and anxiety. I actually did talk to one of his close female friends. She was very understanding of my need to out him in front of his rest of his friends. She also told me that she'd told this to 2/3 friends of theirs, and they were pretty upset about his behavior as well and how he hid me from them all these years. They didn't even know he had a gf all this time.\n\nHonestly, I wan't to tell everyone who'd listen to me. It's been a tough burden to carry. I think I still am trauma-bonded and think about going to him all the time, just to keep asking questions I know he'll never have the answers to. If I do this, there won't be any going back. This is the very last thing I want do regarding this situation before I try to move on with my life.\n\n",

      "selftext": "D Day +31. One month since I found the smoking gun. I caught them April 1.  Accusation without evidence. But I caught them.  They had been having an emotional affair for months. I called them both the day of their physical manifestation because I was out of town and suspected something.  That’s inconsequential. \nOur 14 year marriage had been suffering from neglect. It worsened after the accusation.  They gaslit the fuck out of me. I wasn’t letting her have any friends outside of our marriage… yada yada. Jokes on me. They were sexting and has a fantasy relationship that was hidden online. Again inconsequential. Just setting up the question. \nSo a week back I made an online dating profile. Had a couple coffee dates. Nothing serious - not intended to be. Have a couple more with other people this week. I want to find myself. I want to have some companionship, even if it’s superficial, that isn’t one of the every one of my friends that won’t touch me with a ten foot pole or ask “how are you holding up” every time I see them. \nWell, stbx and I were eating dinner last night (still have to live together for 2.5 weeks and divorce is filed but cooling period until mid October - also we have a kid who happened to be at a sleepover, but I digress) and she made a statement. Regarding Christmas. “I still want Christmas to be a time we can come together. You have her this year Christmas Eve and I get Christmas Day, but I’d still like to be able to get together even if you were dating someone else and brought them with Christmas Day”\nSo my question to her, knowing I have said profile, “would you be ok with me dating anyone else by then”?\nShe got upset. Cried and ran off. Came back and said she was just shocked to hear it. I told her that I hope when she’s ready she can find whatever happiness she can in life on the other side of this and I’d hope she’d feel the same to me. Cake eating, right? I’m just supposed to be a lonely, joyless, sexless old hag waiting to “get better” or for her to be comfortable with she fucking left me and I want to be appreciated more than I have been since god knows when? Yea. Sex is a thing I want as well. I’m 42. I’m not a fucking priest. \nI’m not in a hurry to “replace” her, but is there a too soon to just get out and enjoy meeting people? I’m not trying to lead anyone on. I’m trying to unspool a 16 bind. My known intention is no expectations. How long did you all wait before even talking to anyone again.  I’m lonely AF and just want something to bring me some joy. I can only meditate, read, work out, go to work, eat and sleep so much. I have hobbies. I just want to be able to share some of my day with someone. ",

In April, I found out my fiancée cheated on me, and just two weeks later, I was diagnosed with a deep vein thrombosis. It felt like life had dealt me a double-whammy, and the support I got from this community was incredible.\n\n​I'm happy to report that I've made a lot of progress. I got my bachelor's degree, landed a great new job, and have really leaned into my hobbies. I've been boxing again, started jiu-jitsu, and recently got off blood thinners, so I can even go skateboarding again. I've lost 25 pounds and, both physically and mentally, I feel like I'm in a good place.\n\n​The one exception is dating. I've met two really wonderful people, but I've prematurely cut things off with both of them. The truth is, I'm terrified of being hurt again. I find myself actively looking for potential red flags—even when they aren't really there—just so I have a reason to bail.\n​So, I'm hoping to get some perspective from others who have been through this.\n\n​Is this a normal feeling?\n\n​Am I damaged goods, or is this just part of the process?\n\n​Do I simply need more time before I can truly put myself out there again?\n\n​Any and all advice is greatly appreciated.

      "selftext": "So, I (27F) recently found out that my husband(28M) of almost 1 year(together 8 years) has been getting happy ending massages for the last year and a half. I had suspected something was off earlier this year and decided to go through his phone. I found a couple of odd messages, but nothing too crazy. I let it go, but looked again a few weeks ago. This time I found messages from several months earlier of him scheduling a message. It was odd because of how unprofessional it was. I also had no idea he was getting a message. I did think he lied to me about somewhere he went around the same time and I correlated these two events. I confronted him and he told me yes he did get a massage but it was just a regular massage and he didn’t step out on our relationship… I gave him the benefit of the doubt because this has never been a problem in our relationship. We are both very responsible people and he is honestly known as being the good guy. In fact, my friends even made jokes that he would be the least likely to cheat out of anyone we knew.\n\nSo, from this conversation we talked about some things we need to work on and I told him some boundaries I had. This included him being less involved in his online gaming group because I know they are bad influences. The next few weeks were great. We were spending more quality time together and I had practically already forgiven him for lying. Then comes to last night. We went out with friends and my husband got drunk. I was up and decided to go through his phone to dig a little deeper. Welp, let’s just say I found some stuff I didnt want to. I went through his cash app and found some payments to girls I didn’t know. I also saw porn in his recent search history. I knew he watched from time to time and was okay with it for certain circumstances, but was definitely hurt because of what we were going through. I thought he was trying to be better.  \n\nAnyways, I confronted him not knowing the severity of the situation. He immediately comes clean and tells me he’s been getting massages for the last year and a half or so. Yes, this means right in the middle of our engagement and new marriage lolz. He explained to me that it started because he was lonely living in his new house by himself and just struggling with all of the weight of life (he does a lot for other people and works a lot). He said it was just a way to distract himself. He originally got the idea from his gaming friends and decided to try it out one day. Apparently, he finds them on Craigslist or Reddit and will just call or text them to schedule. He says some were just regular massages and some were happy endings. And it probably added up to around 20 or so in total. He agreed it was insane and that he has an issue. He said he tried to stop several times and would do good for a while until he just gave in. \n\nHe is very open to whatever we need to do to fix it. He also told me if I don’t think I will be able to get over it he understands. He understands and agrees that porn is a real issue and I told him from here on out I will consider that cheating as well. He said it has nothing to do with me or our sex life just his own issues. He is planning to go to therapy and then we will consider marriage counseling as well. I told him how I felt about the whole thing. I think I’m actually more upset about him lying to me than anything else. I understand (but do not condone) giving into impulses. I just would never do it to him. \n\nThe reality is this is our FIRST year of marriage and I don’t know what to do. He is a great man and does everything right for everyone as much as possible. I think he has real issues he needs to work on as do I. Neither of us have good examples of relationships in our lives and we struggle a lot with communication. This sometimes leads to us not meeting each others emotional needs. I absolutely hate that he made my life so much harder than it has to be. I think it’s definitely possible to forgive and move on eventually, but at mostly concerned with the future of our marriage. If he is willing to do this now how do I know he wouldn’t do it again? Especially dealing with hard times etc… anyways, all advice is appreciated! What are some things I should consider before moving forward? How do I approach our relationship right now? Help:))\n\n",

      "selftext": "This is all still very fresh and this first time anything like this has happened to me. My (f30) husband (m27) has been causing a lot of fights recently over nothing. We recently got married in June of this year after being together for 10 years. We had a huge fight night before last due to his drinking. The next morning he apologized and admitted he didn’t even remember why he started the fight and regretted speaking down to me. \n\nThis is something that has been happening more frequently recently, since before the wedding. I blamed it on a lot of life changes he was going through but last night I couldn’t shake the feeling that he was hiding something. I went through his phone while he was sleeping. Something I never do. \n\nI went to his hidden folder on his iPhone and found 3 videos. My heart absolutely dropped as I was faced with the previews of the videos. One of them with a girl completely naked, her hand in between her legs and his smaller photo in the corner. I knew they were all video chats. I went to a separate room to watch them. There was no sound since he was wearing headphones when he screen recorded the call but it was absolute undeniable proof that he paid for these women to get off with him over video call. \n\nI couldn’t hear him but I could see him talking, foreplay, smiling and exposing himself to the camera as he got off. The first video was from 2022. The second was from Aug 2024. The third video was just of a girl but not a video call and was from Oct 2024. I woke him up and told him that I felt like something was off and I couldn’t stop thinking. I asked him if there was anything he wanted to tell me and that he should put it into the open so we could move past it. He said there was nothing. Then I showed him the saved videos. \n\nI haven’t slept since then and he’s only just now left the house. I told him he needs to move out today but we are the current guardians to his teenage sister so I’m giving him time to set up before she moves as well. \n\nIt’s important to note that divorce does NOT exist in my country. I don’t know what I’m suppose to do. He’s done a lot of problematic things in the past but I never thought he would cheat. It was the one thing I was confident in and this has completely thrown me through a loop. He said he hasn’t ever done something with another woman physically but what he did was still cheating. I can’t forget the look on his face while talking to those girls. And it’s even worse for me to process because all of the girls were a completely different body type to me. They were all extremely small and it hurts to know that that’s the type that he seeks out \n\nI guess I’m just posting here to beg for advice. \n\nEDIT: I am the sole provider financially for us. I’m asking for advice because I don’t know if this is something I should end a relationship over or if I should try to work through it with him. ",

      "selftext": "Hello my dears! How are you?\n\nRemember me? \nIt’s been such a long time, since getting cheated on, finding out my husband was not only cheating with a friend of mine, but he was also becoming a dad.\n\nI have so many things that I can share.\n\nFirst things first, it all feels so distant, almost as if it’s not my story. \nI remember spending all my time in  indulging greatly in my sorrow, pondering on a reality where this would not matter and believing that this would be a forever reality for me. \nThat I would forever be the person that got cheated on and that the people that hurt me would become the only happy individuals out of this mess.\n\nI’m enlightened to share that it is completely out of my reality now. I rarely think about it and I rarely feel like I’m a survivor. Isn’t that just so sweet? Not being a forever victim and joy letting someone else’s laps of judgment be my definition of happiness, that is who I am. \nAnd that’s who you can be!\n\nI dated around, had some intense connections and relationships. It was all so new, as I’ve always been just with my ex, loving someone else felt so different. But right.\n\nCurrently I’m single, and I feel very happy.\nBack in my home country, but I will soon move out again.\n\nI have a feeling that I will find a new version of  happiness, and that is something we all deserve.\nIt’s not always linear of course. \nSometimes dating and trust feels two opposites and other times I remember that I can’t be the only person that doesn’t cheat in this world. \nI have to trust that there is something good out there. I also have to trust that if I fall I will survive. That’s who I am, a strong person.\n\nAs for my ex. Last time I saw him, it was during a common friend’s bday party. We had a weird moment.\nHe spent some time talking to my friends and for the first time in a long time approached me. Looked me in the eyes. It felt sincere. Finally.\nWe had a normal conversation, updated eachother on silly things. Cathartic.\nAt times it felt weird that we were not friends at least anymore, other moments it felt weird that he betrayed me. Other times it was clear he is a slave to his desires. A man that lacks vision.\n\nHe is still with her. Not out of love, out of duty. \nThey are not happy, she is jealous and still worries about me. He feels trapped but wants to be a present dad. \nHe believes that if he leaves her she will rase issues with custody.\nGod, a moment of “ listening to your desire” ended up being a life sentence.\n\nYet, it didn’t feel good. I didn’t think “ oh yeah, look at karma”. It didn’t feed my well being or my personal journey. It feels all so useless. \nNonetheless I also feel owner of my journey.\nI think I’m not a follower of who hurt me. I’m not waiting for someone’s downfall to feel worthy of love and serenity.\n\nHow are you guys doing? I’ve been trying to update for a while, yet I kept forgetting, if you have questions share. And if you are having an experience please share!\nI wish you all a day where you’ll forever know you are worthy and not defined by your pain!!!\n",

I ended up bringing too much attention to this and it became a bit of a local scandal. \n\nWe’re both in our 20s and hetro. We’ve had a great relationship and I had no reason to suspect anything.

The week before I found out, she even brought up having another kid, so I know she wasn’t planning to leave me. \n\nI’m also Catholic and divorce is not an option, particularly since she’s very remorseful and wants to save the marriage. \n\nWhole situation is humiliating for both of us. \n\nHas anyone successfully and happily made it past a situation like this? \n\nEdit: not looking for commentary about my faith.

I've read the conversations. I would say 99% of what they talked about was just friendly chats as she told me. A couple messages from my wife seemed close to crossing a boundary. \n\nI made it through the summer, kids at home, 2 weekend trips, 1 long vacation, so many events and nights spent together. For the past few weeks, she's been very affectionate, loving, caring, and intimate with me all the time. \n\nYet....they are still talking.  \n\nMy therapist told me a communication technique called the Gentle Startup. I tell her how I feel and then what I need. I want to say as little as possible so she can't divert the conversation. \n\nMy plan is to simply tell her that I'm still feeling confused because she hasn't told me what's going on with the guy. I'm just going to ask her to tell me what's going on with him. \n\nIf she lies, then I have to call her out on it and tell her I looked at her phone I guess. I feel like she'll just go crazy saying I invaded her privacy and it will ruin what I want to accomplish. \n\nIf she says she doesn't plan to stop talking to him entirely, I am going to tell her that we can't stay married. I think I have been doing the \"pick me\" game hard with her and I have to stop myself. I really think she just wants to keep talking to this guy, stay married until either the guy wants something more or he moves on. \n\nI'm not sure exactly what advice I'm asking for here but if anyone has gone through something similar I would love to hear any guidance. I love her immensely and this has been a very hard summer on me. I want our marriage to remain and for her to end this ridiculous shit she's put me through. \n\n",

We reconnected, we found a couples therapist and we agreed that we would be a couple again.\n\nLast week was Mexico. I had a few triggers, but overall it reminded me of how much I loved him. He was so warm, loving, and it was everything that I loved about him and us, once again, I realized I wanted a life with him.\n\nBut this week he turned cold, distant. Being such a dismissive avoidant, I attributed that to him having an emotional rebound from being so close. We talked, even hung out, went golfing. But I noticed his tone had shifted away from reconciliation and warmth, to listing his own grievances and what he needs out of the relationship. It felt selfish but we talked.\n\nHe even told me that I could move back in, and I made it clear that if I did, it meant we needed to both put mutual effort into healing\n\nThat was last night. We were laughing, connecting, and unfortunately drinking.\n\nThen it happened again.\n\nWithin one night I went from feeling like we were on the same page to being told to get the hell out of his life. Acting like he was the victim and I was the problem.\n\nIt’s almost one year to the day when I found the first text, giving me a clue something was going on. It’s been one year of learning about all of the lies, and the other women and the betrayal.\n\nWe’ve been together nine years and in the last 2 1/2 he had:\n\n* a consistent friend with benefits\n* bumble dates\n* another woman that wanted a relationship with him that he ghosted\n* at least one, one night stand\n* hook up with an old flame, just because she texted\n* A mistress of seven months that only broke off when I caught him\n* he cheated on the mistress with a another one for 3 months\n\nIt’s easy from the outside looking in that I should focus on myself, that he’s not worth the tears, the pain and the heartbreak.\n\nIt’s not easy. I know he loves me, but he is broken, and unfortunately, his brokenness, broke me.\n\nI tried. I gave my everything. I endured month after month of trickle truth. I saw his hurting inner child and would’ve stood next to him if he chose to heal.\n\nBut it has reached the point where the pain of staying is greater than the pain of leaving.",

My father had a serious stroke recently he is in rehab so she must postponed her plans with her new lover. \n\nA year now i knew that something was off and i knew that i failed her in many ways and she wanted to take distance from me but I thought she just had friends and wanted solitude. My mom present herself as a moral, religious person and even though my mind had thoughts that she speak to someone i could never imagine that she has an actual affair.

We agreed thatvwe wouldnt talk to this person until we were able to work on us and see if we were going to work out or not, and until we can rebuild trust. So we are still together working on things and we've both seen improvements as us individually and as a couple. Although my insecurities keep trying to tell me shes still texting and talking to him. I would never go through her phone due to personal values and when I ask she says hasn't been communicating with him. My gut is telling me that she is though.

I'm not sure how common it is for members to seek advice that fall on the OTHER side of the coin of infidelity. I will try to keep my message short, but no promises. \n\n\nI'm 26M with a wife and have been married for about three years. I have been fighting myself for the past couple years and I believe this is my attempt at taking a step forward towards recovery. What I mean by that, is I accept the fact I hold zero remorse/regret or sadness when I have lustful feelings and thoughts towards other women in my life. \n\n\nI want to make it clear that I'm not lustful towards random women I see day to day. Not that it makes this any better, but to clarify I only feel these lustful emotions towards friends who are close to me. I'm aware professional help may need to be used. I've read into affair fog and limerence when I'm confident relates to my situation. \n\n\nI want to move past this and fix myself. I am tired of thinking I have a \"shot\" or a chance to achieve these lustful feelings with other women besides my wife. This may be TMI but I masterbate regularly everyday. This may play a role due to the high levels of dopamine, but I'm no expert. \n\n\nI appreciate it if you read this far. Again, I apologize if this post is inappropriate for the sub. \n\n\nMay anyone who's faced something similar provide advice and possibly a way forward to recovery?",

Almost all the friends he introduced me to are senior in age (we are in our 30s). \n\nI do not know the extent of his \"addiction\" (his term) but it since bothered me if he is a risk to his clients.

I also do not have evidence that he commits assault to others.\n\nIf you were in my shoes, would you report or better live life minding your own peace now?",

But I am physically disgusted every time they try to be intimate with me. \n\nThe weird thing is, I’m not actively thinking about the cheating. It just feels like I’m more aware/sensitive to other things. Like I notice their breath more, their kiss is too spitty, the way that they talk to me is corny, etc.\n\nI know this has to be a result of the infidelity, but it just doesn’t feel super cut-and-dry because it’s not the cheating that feels like the issue in the moment. Has anyone else had it happen/feel like this? Have you been able to get over it?\n\nI’m wondering if talking to them about the specific issues will help— like they use too much spit when kissing me or that it makes me cringe when they say “hey you” before pulling me closer to them in our bed —or if that’s just something that will wear away at their confidence with no positive results.\n\nEdit: for context, this is an 8 year relationship and they started cheating in the second year. It has always been different levels of cheating with different people. ",

      "selftext": "I’ve never shared this before, but it’s been eating me alive and I don’t know what to do anymore.\n\nWhen I was 9 or 10, I discovered my mom was cheating on my dad. I saw a sexually explicit text from her phone to a number that wasn’t his. After that, I noticed she would be on the phone all the time while my dad was working, and when I asked who she was talking to, she always lied. She would “go get groceries” every single day and take forever to come back. She even made me talk to this person once through texts and told me that they were her best friend. \n\nI come from an orthodox Muslim family where gossip, shame, and ostracism can destroy someone’s life. We also don’t talk about feelings in our household. So I kept it all inside. I remember praying every night that this man would die so I could have my mom back. Sometimes I acted out and was disrespectful to her because I didn’t know how else to handle it but relatives would scold me and she would just act forgiving, like she was the kind one.\n\nThe hardest part is that no one in the family talks about this. Everyone seems to know something is off, but it’s all silence. My dad has anger issues and is addicted to alcohol. When I was a child, I saw him break my sick grandmother’s arm during an argument. He told me he’d do the same if I didn’t keep my mouth shut. He was gone all the time and when he was home he was drunk, angry and abusive. I never shared a bond with him. I’ve been terrified of him my whole life. He’s also uneducated and doesn’t know how to use a phone, so he may not know about the affair. Or maybe he does and chooses to ignore it. \n\nBecause of all this, my brother and I completely stopped talking to each other. It’s been 10 years now. I sometimes think maybe he resents that I was able to leave. I came to the US at 14 for school, while he’s still stuck living with them. But instead of bringing us closer, these issues only pushed us further apart.\n\nNow I’m 25, and I’m realizing the truth: my mom has probably been cheating on my dad their whole marriage. My childhood and family life were deeply messed up, and it physically hurts me. I feel extremely guilty about keeping this from my dad and so I’ve also stopped talking to him all together. I used to talk to my mom all the time, but in the last couple of months I’ve stopped talking much. Our calls are very superficial and short, and I know she senses it. I hate pretending that there isn’t this unspoken truth that is slowly gnawing at me. \n\nI left my country, my people, my culture and everything that was familiar so I can be away from my dysfunctional family and it’s caused its own mental health issues. I feel alone in all of this. I feel so fucking isolated all the time. I am questioning my whole life. I don’t practise Islam anymore because my parents weren’t the perfect examples to look up to. I married the man I love and everyone was against it. I married him anyway and because of this all my extended family back home have all stopped talking to me. In there eyes I’m the one who is lost from the “holy path.” This is another reason my brother and I have become estranged because he took the religious path to find peace and I did the opposite because it was deeply confusing to watch my own parents do everything that I was deeply indoctrinated to not do. That’s why silencing runs so deep in honor cultures and communities like these.  \n\nShe’s taken everything away from me but I’m scared to confront my mom or tell my dad and what does that make me ? What kind of person have I become? I don’t recognize myself anymore. I worry she would hurt herself, or my dad would hurt her if he found out. I worry the family would completely exclude her, and she has no education or independence to survive on her own. And yet… I can’t keep protecting her like this anymore.\n\nWhat I don’t understand is why am I still protecting her? Why is it so fucking impossible to bring this up? Why do I still carry her secret when it’s killing me inside? How do I even start healing from something I’ve held alone for 15 years?\n",

      "selftext": "It’s been a hot minute since I’ve been in this group, and thank you for the support back when I was going through the dark times. \nI thought I’d share some thoughts on the mutual journey many of us are on, and how I’ve managed to navigate it.\n\nI was 38, with my partner for 21 years, and married for 6. She had multiple affairs from early on, and during Covid, and each time I made excuse after excuse on why I should give her another chance. Looking back at it now, that wasn’t her fault I kept giving her chances, that was on me. I think what held me back was fear. How would I start over? How would I date when I never once dated anyone new as an adult? How would I live without the one constant that was in my life at the time? I came up with every excuse as to why I would not be dateable, and why I’d likely end up alone. \n\nThere’s a fun acronym I like which is F.E.A.R False Evidence Appearing Real. Every BS reason I gave myself were just false insecurities. \n\nI finally made the decision after seeing the confirmation that she had pregnancy tests done, and decided it was better to learn how to live without her than to learn to live with her disrespect. \n\nSo began the journey of finding me. Online dating seemed fun, let’s try it. I went in with the attitude that I’m going to have experiences, and learn rather than try to find the one person. This prevented me having defeatist attitudes whenever dates didn’t work out. It’s all part of the process. My friends and I joked about “Project 40 before 40” It was simply an attitude of going on 40 first dates before I turned 40. The number didn’t matter, but the attitude of getting out there and trying did. \n\nI learned how to date, how to make profiles, and just treated it like a hobby. \nI also had to work on other areas of my life like my weight. I got back into marital arts which I hadn’t done in 20 years. I learned to drive (I live in a metro city, so it was never really a necessity). I travelled a lot. It felt like I was on a plane every other month. I spent more time with friends and family, and even had a divorce party just to have some closure. \n\nThe cherry on top is I met someone a year ago, and she’s simply amazing. It’s the type of woman I never would’ve believed I’d ever have a chance with. Again that’s a confidence issue, and even my ex wife was extremely supportive of me when I first started dating in general saying I’d have no problem finding someone, I still thought there was just a hard line separating women who’d like me, and those who’d run. Again, F.E.A.R.\n\nI think we get too caught up in the negatives that we don’t even allow our brains to exercise the potential positives of our situations. Sure it sucks, but infidelity ins’t just a one time mess up, it’s a systemic issue in a relationship. Sure you can take a glue gun to a broken mug, but it really is just easier to buy a new one. \n\nIf we actually took the time to write out our fears, and read them out loud, we’d probably realize how ridiculous they are. There are just too many people out there that won’t abuse your relationship, or treat you poorly to try and work on someone who is beyond work. Even being alone is preferable to that.\n\nAnyway, just wanted to share some perspective, and how I survived infidelity. \nLast thing, I saw a therapist, I’d suggest the same for you.\n",

      "selftext": "Grief, in reality, is a form of death with all the pain and trauma it brings.\n\nI’ve been divorced for a few months from my ex-wife who cheated. In her last attempt to make me feel like shit, she told me she “wanted to work it out.” Of course I called her out on her bullshit because she was cheating and lying all the way up to the very end.\n\nBut do you know how badly it hurts to know she is now with her AP instead? That she will build a new life with him now in my place? That I was never going to be good enough?\n\nOf course you know.\n\nJust like I know the advice.\n\nIt’s a “trauma bond”; I have to “stop thinking of her in terms of cheating”; focus on the kids; move on; get under someone new; gym and therapy; there’s someone for everyone……more kind and well-meaning words, ad infinitum.\n\nI get it. In theory, I really do. And on my best days, getting the theory from head to heart or even just being at a base line of regulated and calm are ideal. \n\nBut what about the worst days? The days I don’t want to wake up, let alone shower? The days I remember the woman I loved and poured my life and heart out for and who I thought *actually* loved me in return? The woman I believed (and believed in) for so many years.\n\nI mean, I often wonder now, do people even have good marriages after a decade together? Or is it all just a façade? Apparently I didn’t. So is this just my grief inflating my supposed love for her all those years? After all, I can clearly recall and dwell on all the awful things she said and did and became over the years now.\n\nOr is this just…the nature of grief? The overwhelming sensation that no matter how long it has been, no matter how many steps I have taken toward healing, no matter how many beautiful women I encounter, no matter how many friendships I invest it, no matter how much work I put in, no matter how much I learn to live and thrive alone, no matter rational any of it may be, I feel like death has already had the final word even though I’m very much still alive.\n\nJust know, if you’re here, and this resonates, I see you. My heart skips literal beats when I read your stories, when I hear your pain. I recognize your tears because in so many ways, they are mine. And I’m sorry you are here, too.",

      "selftext": "\nCan we save this?\n\n\nBackstory: I have 2 kids with 2 different woman and 1 failed marriage in my history.\n\nWhen my wife and I met, I shared custody of both my children with their mothers, things very quickly blew up and 4 years later I have sole custody of both kids. My wife's been there through it all, she has no kids. I cannot put a price on the value of what she has given up in her life to change it to become a step mom. It's a big deal to do that for someone.\n\nNow the dirty, Me: several months after we married. She was on my computer while typing a search was suggested some porn links from my history, recalling it. It was from me just on Reddit on my phone one night and I ended up redditing a bit too much and ended up viewing smut about Elden Ring lol, I didn't jerk it or anything it was more of an obscene curiosity.\n\nShe was betrayed, she doesn't like porn and had vocalized her views well in the past. I ended up coming clean that I had in fact used porn while we were together for masterbation. And that, I hate to admit. Not always really straight.. it changed her view of me, she felt that I didn't want her in her body and it took a lot of work to help her believe that, no. I married her because I do absolutely love her, I do. And I wouldn't pick anyone over her. I stopped, for her and for myself honestly because it made me see that I had a problem with controlling myself. That was almost 2 years ago.\n\nHer: 2 months ago, I wanted to listen to music while doing dishes in the morning. But the speaker kept auto connecting to her phone. She was sleeping in so I grabbed her phone to shut BT off and a text came across that moment that said \"good morning boo\". She woke up, took her phone quickly and I actually just went on with my day with some sort of belief that maybe it was explainable.\n\nWhen she got ready to leave to her grandmas to study that day, I asked her. And things clearly didn't add up, she left without allowing me to see the conversation, and came back an hour later and came clean, it was a man from work she had developed a relationship with, they were hanging out sometimes instead of her actually going to her grandmas. It killed me, and I haven't been right since. \n\nA day later I let her know I was getting the phone records to see how deep it went, and she came clean (again) that actually they had made out last time they hung out. Wrecked me again, way worse. I guess the thing that still plagues me about this is that, I'm not sure that it is even still the full truth, and that I do believe if it hadn't, it was certainly going further than that if I hadn't found out.\n\n2 days ago, we were in our umpteenth fight and she was having another almost manic break down, it has been a theme our entire relationship, and exhausts me. I couldn't even feel empathy for her, despite her having an actual reason this time to be in that state. I just can't. So I kind of called it, said I just can't be who she needs and that I don't believe things are going to get better\n\nShe still wants a relationship, and this is messing me up pretty bad too, I do love her, I do miss her. The kids do too. But I am so, so tired, I have not been a good man since and I just see fire whenever she gets overly emotional anymore. I wish it were different and am so torn, it feels like my entire life is just ruined. \n\nIdk what I'm even asking for honestly, has anyone been in a similar situation at all?\n**Edit**\nClarifying, after Dday she did end the affair. She had left again and done it... When I asked to see those messages they were deleted as well, though the phone records showed it was quite the conversation again with how many messages were sent. Then nothing, the next day she received a text from him saying \"I hate this\" and she showed me and blocked the number, and deleted that message too. I really can't emphasize how much I hate the deleting stuff. But that's where it's all at anyway",

      "title": "A Reminder for Anyone Who Still Loves a Cheating Partner",
      "selftext": "This story is a reminder for those who still love their cheating partner. It's graphic. But I hope it helps.\n\n​After my ex-fiancée cheated on me multiple times, something I never did to her, I became angry and my empathy went numb. Even though it's been eight months since we separated, I still don't have closure and feel like I need her.\n\n​Then, three days ago at the gym, I helped a random girl with her form on the pec fly machine, and we started talking. Because of my experience as a \"therapist\" to my exes, I have a knack for getting people to open up quickly. Right there in the gym, she started trauma-dumping on me about her marriage.\n​She told me she felt empty in her marriage, that her husband didn't want her, was physically violent when drunk, was jealous, etc. I could tell some of it was a lie.\n\n​The next day we met at the gym, she didn't talk much, but when I asked for her name, she suddenly gave me her number too.\n\n​She's not my type, but we share a hobby: swimming. She's a competitive swimmer, and she asked me to go swimming with her. I agreed.\n\n​Later that day, we swam together. She talked a lot about herself but wasn't particularly interested in what I had to say. She told me her version of her 1 and half years old marriage, including that she couldn't conceive a child because her husband smoked and drank too much. She also had surgery for an ectopic pregnancy, but her husband didn't go with her. She made it sound like she was completely alone in her marriage, even though I knew her husband still cared for her and she was just exaggerating their problems.\n\n​I tried to keep my distance and just give her my best advice, but that changed. She started flirting with me, telling me I was the hottest guy she'd ever met and that she felt lucky to have met me. She said she wanted my body. That's when I knew this was starting to feel very wrong.\n\n​That night, she told me she was \"in heat\" and her husband didn't want her. So she asked me to sleep with her.\n\n​That's when I lost all my boundaries. I booked a room and asked her to come over. We started making out, and she wanted me to \"help her conceive\" a child. So I did.\n\n​That's wild.\n\n​I should probably hide the details. Overall, our conversations felt clumsy and one-sided. She disrespected her husband a lot in front of me and said she was getting revenge by cheating. I don't know for sure, and I didn't ask for details. It all happened so fast. But she wants us to never stop what we did.\n\n​Now, I think I understand what happened between my ex-fiancée and the person she cheated with. I feel like I've become a morally corrupt person. On one hand, I feel guilty, but on the other, I feel relieved because I got a real-life example of my fiancée's behavior.",

He was (is) a fuck boy and I have only had serious relationships.\n\nSince 2019 he showed me that he struggled with monogamy, I decided to stay because all aside from his constant cheating he is a good man that makes me feel love.\n\nMoving forward to 2024, we get married and even though there has been multiple sexting, photos (with both women that he has history with and random sluts online) and hidden accounts that I had been finding throughout the whole relationship. We married because I thought he had gotten over his porn/masturbation/sex addiction, that he had been a good honest man.\n\nToday, 2025, I found out this man has continued to cheat on me “in waves” as he calls it. Sexting, buying nudes, etc. Keep in mind we do not have sex at all, with all the cheating I became extremely insecure about myself to start sex, and he would never start it either. He can be sweet, kind, but never shows desire or lust towards me.\n\nHe says this time it’s different because he is now getting help with an addiction therapist and an accountability partner. We also had honest conversations where he told me all his fantasies and desires, which he said he felt scared of opening up with me about that before because we had completely banned porn out of our relationship because of the previous incidents.\n\nHe loves me and I love him very much as well. But this is becoming more than I can handle, I trusted he had changed and that’s why I agreed to marry him. I definitely have some sort of PTSD.\nLeaving him is scary, very much. But I think I have at some point to start respecting myself since no one else will…\n\nIf you have had someone that you love with porn addiction? Do you think that person can change with love and help? I feel so angry, lost and lonely.\n\nHe swears he has never met physically with anyone since 2021 that we moved in together.\n\nI also found that he paid for pics from a woman only 3 days after our wedding… that one hurt a lot",

We got engaged \n and shit. went. downhill. he started following tons of women online, commenting on their pictures??? (like r u crazy??), paying for onlyfans, etc. now this is why I say it’s unique. He would subscribe to onlyfans links of my clients (I’m a hairstylist) & it would create a really odd feeling for me when working.  I would be taunted by my man’s attraction to this woman and my client(S) would have had no idea. Very shitty feeling. I deserve to have normal work days without secret triggers. (Not mad at the clients btw. Mad at him for putting me in that position) \n\nI have found endless screenshots in his phone of random women but also women I have introduced him to (family friends, best friends, coworkers, etc.) here is where it gets really sick. I have found hundreds and hundreds of these hand written lists around the house and these lists have women he fantasizes about fucking. This list would include IG models, pornstars, his exes, my friends, family, etc. let’s say my name is Ava, he would even label the list “Ava’s following” “Ava’s friend’s” and then it would be a list of all my friend’s names or @‘s of all the mutual girls I had on social media. He would even follow them. He would follow women I worked with that I never introduced him to or mentioned. Is this not harassment??? Emotional abuse?? I know this is for sure not normal but has anyone else went thru this or is it just me and I’m like somewhat desensitized to this behavior bc it’s been going on for so long? Like this is insane to me. It really scares me. It feels like having a secret enemy who is deliberately trying to humiliate me or something and I’m not sure what for? It’s almost like a fetish or excitement for betrayal at the expense of my emotions :/  \n\nit’s also even more sick and confusing bc outside of this….he is a present and loving father to our daughter (he does not play about her lol) …he is a gentleman to me in our day to day….he supports my businesses and everything that i do. He is literally my #1 supporter. He’s a good time to be around. He reads a lot of self help books so he tends to have a pretty positive outlook on life and has really positive energy. We have really good chemistry and can yap for hoursss. We will literally have the best day ever then boom. He’s in the bathroom taking screenshots of the coworker I introduced him to earlier. so I definitely feel like I am dealing with 2 split ppl. Idk. I left him tho 3 months ago & we’ve been working on having a healthy coparenting relationship for our kid. (Per his request) It’s been going AMAZING. Such a healthy dynamic & then two days ago he goes and follows thousands of women and includes some of my friends. (Which crosses my boundaries that I’ve spoke about a million times) After we’ve had such a successful time coparenting he’s so weird. I just had to block him and give it god. Im thru 😂",

I’m 18 m found out my mom was cheating on my dad with someone 25 fucking years old when I was 15. Do I have to go into detail on how much this affected me and still has. She definitely had a mid life crisis after recovering from cancer.. leading her to shit like that. Everyone in my family seems to be over it even my dad. While I can’t fucking sleep at night. How am I supposed to feel like a fucking man when my mom is sleeping around with people like 8 years fucking older me or whatever. It’s literally all I can think about when im not thinking of something else. If my minds not busy I get tortured cause of what my mom chose to done. I can go into detail and what I would do to that guy if I saw him today being older but I would probably get put on a list. Recently a few months ago my mom had passed. Now I have to remember all the memories before her crisis of her being loving and then her just ruining our family. It’s like to I love and reminisce ? Cause when I reminisce I think of what she fucking did. \n\nWill I ever get over this? When I ever be able to sleep at night comfortably ? How the fuck do I feel like a man after this.\n\nShort terms: mom cheated on dad with person was younger , recently passed still can’t accept or deal with this mentallly, feel like im going insane",

      "selftext": "This sucks so much.  I had a previous girlfriend cheat on me. That wrecked me, took me years to recover from depression, and I liked myself again. That was just a situationship.\n\nNow, my girlfriend (33F) of 6 years, someone who I shared my deepest trauma with, someone who I literally took out of her deepest lowest point in her life, met someone, spent 2 weeks with him, and cheated on me in third week multiple times. She was going to break up with me this weekend so that she could move on, but I ended up finding out and confronted her this Monday. This sucks so so much. \n\nShe knew how this was such a major trigger for me, she knew this was the one line I asked her not to cross. She knew this was my deepest trauma. Yet she followed the same playbook, and is defending it because it's \"love\". In fact trying to tell me why it was okay and it wasn't just a physical thing. This just makes it so so much worse.\n\nShe apparently has deep conversations with him that last hours, and they are aligned on life goals. Wow. Oh he's also super wealthy. And he can take care of her when they have kids while I would have wanted her to work(in this economy who wouldn't). [Edit] the AP was married, in a relationship for 10 years.\n\nI feel so broken. She's living the time of her life in her new environment making so many friends in grad school. I'm here, alone in SF in a new environment with none of my friends since I just moved here. \n\nI just feel so fucking used. I feel so fucking humiliated. Nobody wanted her (she isn't conventionally attractive) but I thought she was kind and that's all I cared about, and now turns out that wasn't true either. Unlike my previous ex, who was a stunner - I chose a good heart with my current ex, who I thought would never do this to me. Turns out, evil can come in many forms.\n\nIs there anyone in SF who was cheated on who just wants to grab a bite to eat, maybe even just sit and watch TV and movies at night to make it less lonely. I don't know what to do. I have no social support here like I do from the city I moved from, and my family is all across the world. ",

I only found this out a couple of days ago from my sister and tried to confront her today by asking her who this guy was and why she was “talking” to him. She lied to my face and said “he’s just a friend” “your dad’s fine with it”??? And that its just flirty banter between them? My dad let out an ironic laugh after I asked her about this guy, he obviously cares doesn’t he? I can’t imagine he’d be fine with being CHEATED on? I can’t look at her the same way, I don’t understand why she’s doing this or if she is still doing this. We went out as a family just a few days ago and they were all lovey dovey? Your wife just got bent over by another man… I am sickened. It looks like it isn’t affecting my dad and it’s not my business but it’s affecting me.",

We also had 2 trips already booked and paid for in the same year. I decided to stay. I was lonely, younger, dumb, and regret it. \n\nHe never seemed like he would do it again, just he never told me a single detail more that what i’ve shared here. i don’t even know her name. she was never a saved contact and he won’t tell me who she is. I have no idea what they spoke about at all. \nI actually contacted her when i found out initially and she said they hadn’t seen each other in years. so why send a nude out of nowhere? 💀 ON TEXT TOO not even an app..\n\nbut he just found his apple watch this week and it all came flooding back. i just cannot stop thinking about it. I’m so mad at him i haven’t spoken to him in a full sentence in 2 days. i just can’t.\n\nidk who i expect to save me or tell me what to do or what i expect from this. i just know i’ve had enough of being jealous. i was jealous before i met him, but NOT like this. I can’t even walk into a public place without accusing him of checking out a girl. i just feel AND SEE with my own eyes that he is doing it. He says he didn’t cheat 🙄and that he only tried to because he was going through a lot in that time of life. So the next time life gets hard you won’t do it again? \n\nI wish so badly to not have this fear of being alone. i love being physically alone. but the thought of having no one scares me. I’m already starting to push away from him and i feel better already. \n\nThat’s all .. thanks :/ ",

      "selftext": "I don't even know how to start this post off. I've been a long time lurker on this sub ever since I found out about my mother's infidelity, going back and forth about making a post like this. This is probably gonna come off as disconnected rambling about different things but I feel like I have to do it.\n\nMy mother's affair shook me. It's made me question everything I knew about her. It has made me feel so much shame especially because she was publicly posting on Facebook about it. I don't use Facebook and neither does my brother or my father. He is old fashioned and doesn't even have a smart phone. None of us would have gotten a headsup if my sister didn't go snooping on my mom's facebook page with my old account (since my mom had blocked her account because she legit hates her for some reason)\n\nMy mother blamed me for her infidelity, citing a conversation we had about her possibly divorcing my dad because at the time she seemed really unhappy. I told her to \"do what you gotta do\" and when this all came out she told me I can't be mad that she hurt my father because I told her that. She said I can't judge her because I'm not married and I would never understand. \n\nIt REALLY hurt to also see my mother lie and gaslight my grandmother and tell her the affair was only going on for a few months when we HAVE PROOF it's been going on for at least 2-3 years. Watching my grandmother run defense for my mother really hurt and watching her shit talk my father didn't help.\n\nThis has completely ruined the family. Holidays will never be the same because everyone except my grandmother wants nothing to do with her. I already didn't talk to half of my family due to my mother refusing to attend any functions with them present over an argument that happened years ago and now I have another entire side of the family I barely ever see.\n\nEver since I cannot even look at her the same. I don't get that like...motherly feeling from her you know? Like when you look at your mom and think \"This is my mom\"? I don't get that anymore. When I look at her I just see a woman who's like...related to me I guess. I don't feel at ease when I'm with her. I'm constantly on edge and it feels like everything she says has a hidden jab in there directed at me or my father or my sister or whoever. \n\nWe haven't talked in a few weeks because she got mad at me for not wanting to watch her dogs and cat even though I watched my dad's dog recently. Not realizing that my dad didn't have a bunch of stipulations like she did like wanting me to stay at her house, having 2 more animals to care for, and her dogs being very poorly trained (seriously one of them is like 90 pounds and acts like a lap dog, constantly jumping and needy for attention)\n\nI'm not even sure if I want to reach out and speak to her. Ever since the divorce my mother has gotten more bitter and miserable. At the very least my dad is far happier now. He is always smiling and lively. Him and his new girlfriend go out and do new things all the time. I'm genuinely happy for him.\n\nDon't really know how to end this but I think my mom really really fucked me up and I'm very upset at her for this and I can't look at her the same ever again.\n\n",

Sometimes, I feel like I'm right back where I was when I first discovered her infidelity. We were together for almost 3 years, living together, future plans and taking care of a dog together to 4 months later, being engaged to another man. I know this is insanity and it doesn't make any sense, but this news still rocked me to my core.\n\nI felt like I was getting better - talking with another girl, engaged in new hobbies, reconnecting with friends & in the best shape I've ever been in. Now, even though nothing changes in hearing this news for myself, I'm back to square one and don't know really know to navigate this shit. \n\nAdvice and thoughts would be appreciated - stay strong",

      "selftext": "Guys, I’m struggling. I need help. I’m worried about myself. I feel so alone. I’m not in immediate danger. I’m not suicidal. But I’m scared. There were moments this week where I felt completely overwhelmed and thought, “How the hell am I going to survive this?” I feel like I need your help!\n\nI made a post here a couple weeks ago about how utterly lost and disconnected I felt after my wife left me. She had an affair and ended our marriage. At the time, I was around 4 weeks into it. I’m doing everything I can: therapy, medication, routines, social contact, gym. It still feels like this massive hole is swallowing me whole. The loneliness is crushing. The grief won’t let up. I feel untethered, exhausted, and more emotionally broken than I’ve ever felt in my life.\n\nNow I’m at the 6-week mark. And if I’m being honest, things feel even worse. I received a painful, final message from my ex reaffirming that she’s 100% done and not looking back. Even though I *knew* that already, something about hearing it again, so bluntly, crushed whatever scraps of hope I’d been clinging to. My intellect knows it’s over. But my emotional body is still catching up. My heart is just now starting to grieve for real. The hardest part is the hopelessness.\n\n* I keep thinking: What if this is who I’ll be now?\n* What if I never find love again?\n* What if I never feel safe, chosen, “okay” again?\n\nI know I’m doing the work. I know this takes time. But it still feels unbearable, like I’m living with a 90% emotional shortage that no amount of self-help or social contact can really fix.\n\n# What I need:\n\nHonestly, I don’t know exactly. Reassurance? Perspective? Just to not feel so invisible in this pain?\n\nIf any of you have been through this....the kind of post-divorce trauma where it’s not just about missing someone, but missing yourself, your map, your sense of being wanted...I’d love to hear how you got through it.\n\nWhat helped?  \nWhat didn’t?  \nHow do you survive when you're doing everything “right” and it’s still not enough?\n\nThank you for reading.  \nTruly. Just writing this out is helping me survive today.",

I found proof. 40 days ago with my last post, I never said I wanted a divorce. I never fully said I was done with her. What I was done with was living in a life where AP was part of it. Even then, I kept helping. I kept holding on. I was still showing up for her and for our family. And then one night she blew up on me over finances, and that very same night she went and slept with him. Through it all, I still didn’t give up. I kept trying. I kept forgiving. I kept hoping she would finally turn back toward me. After everything she finally is. She’s crying on the phone. She’s saying she doesn’t want a divorce. She’s saying she wants to fix this. She even wrote me a note, talking about quitting her job, about wanting us back. Why now? Why only after I moved out? Why only after she got everything she wanted from him — the intimacy, the attention, the love she claimed she couldn’t get from me?She chose AP when it mattered. She gave herself to him. And only now, when reality has caught up, does she suddenly want me again. Timing is screaming at me. After she wrung out the towel with him, now she wants us again? It just doesn’t seem possible for me to forget. I can’t even walk in my house without thinking of him, each hug I think “did he hug her like this” or anything else. If we have sex again all I will think about is how they did. The note claimed how AP doted on her and he was perfect, but he wasn’t me. Now she’s saying she won’t fill out the divorce paperwork, (I know I don’t need her to before proceeding) and doesn’t want me to give up yet. ",

      "selftext": "I am 28M and my wife is 25F. We got married 3 years ago shortly after which I found out she cheated on me (several AP I assume). During the relationship we had our fights and arguments about boundaries. We did long distance for a good bit of relationship leading up the marriage I’d say about 50% LDR and the rest we were living together or close by. There were red flags but I ignored them, please don’t be like me. \n\nWell it’s now 2 years after I found out and like 5 years since she has cheated. (She says it was only one affair partner, for a 2 month period) I made her delete all her dating profiles and cut contact with at least one of her AP. The other AP , I suspect she claims nothing happened. Every time I try to bring it up I’m met with the same responses : “I don’t know” “I don’t remember” . I’m trying incredibly hard to move on, some days I get so triggered by things but bringing it up with her does nothing. I finally found some comfort in music of all things specifically songs from a popular pop singer. Some of her songs shocked me how relatable they were. I grow attached to this artist and start to become a fan. My wife sees this and calls me out on it saying it’s disrespectful to her. I try to tell her that songs make me feel better. She says that at this point I’m just dragging out my feelings so I have an excuse to make her feel bad. I’ve been told over and over again  to “get over it”. She admitted what she did was horrible but claims it was long ago and that at the time she “didn’t know what she wanted” and “wasn’t taking anything seriously”. It was serious for me, it was serious when I ordered flowers to her apartment, when I would send love letters to her apartment, when I would  send snack deliveries during our online movie nights. Now I realize this is the same apartment that she shared with her AP. \n\nShe has told me she wants me to sell my concert tickets I got to that artist and to pay for our couples counseling since it is an issue I caused by “not moving on”. I feel so spineless sometimes. Any words or advice would be greatly appreciated.",

      "title": "Confused on what to do after finding things on my husbands phone",
      "selftext": "don’t usually go through my husbands phone. I have done it maybe 5 times throughout our relationship, we have been together 4 years in December and been married for a year and a half. Every time I do, I do it because I have such a strong gut feeling that something is on there that he hasn’t told me or hasn’t been truthful about.\n\nI have found messaged to other women on there, which weren’t too inappropriate but inappropriate enough to make me upset. Because he also tried to delete them but accidentally put them in his archive folder and I found them. I have tried to get over them. One message to another woman said “I hope your dreams come true, because you are already a dream come true”. So no every time he tries to say something similar to that to me, that’s where my mind goes and I’m disgusted. This was a couple of years ago.\n\nA couple of nights ago, he left his phone in our bedroom while he went downstairs and I don’t know why, I just picked it up and unlocked it. I started feeling a little guilty doing it behind his back so I went downstairs and did it infront of him with him watching. I opened Snapchat, and I seen someone that I didn’t recognize and he received a snap from her a few weeks ago. I asked him and he said it was a girl he went to school with. I opened the messages and scrolled up and there was a saved video of her privates, and then above that it was a saved story he swiped up on asking to be on her private story. This is all from 3 years ago. We weren’t married at that point and were 6 months into our relationship and we had been living together for 4 months at that point.\n\nI ended up messaging her off my account and asking her about this. She stated that she didn’t know that we were together, denied there ever being anything inappropriate and then she said that there was no disrespect on either part and that he loves me. I saw the video, I saw the saved snaps. My husband was with me and saw that I saw them. That pissed me off and sent me off the edge completely. Because how dare she?\n\nI am struggling so much right now. Because I can’t believe that I’m finding out about this 3 years later. I gave him the opportunity to come out with anything he was hiding when I found the first messages with the other women, and he didn’t. He claims that he doesn’t remember any of this, even the other women I found previously. How convenient. If I would have found out 3 years ago, I would have left him and wouldn’t have married him. I’m struggling because I thought we were happy, he said he was in love with me, and now I’m left to wonder why I wasn’t enough. Now I feel like I am in competition with every single girl in the world.\n\nThis changed the way I look at him. It changed our marriage. It changed my love for him. I love him but I don’t want to. Like half of me craves him but the other half is disgusted by him. I can’t believe he did this. I am so angry and I’m grieving the person I thought he was. I feel like I don’t know him. His first apology was “I’m sorry you found out about something that happened years ago.” It’s been years, yeah, but it’s new for me. I was blindsided.\n\nHow do I get over this when all I can think about is this? The video keeps replaying in my head, the fact that he swiped up on her. He keeps saying that he didn’t go out of his way to do it and that it was right in his face, but he swiped up. He thought about it, he acted on it. To me, that’s going out of his way. Also, there had to have been some sort of sexual conversation going on for her to send the video to him. I know better.\n\nI guess I just would love some advice from someone who has been through something similar or just infidelity in general?\n\nThank you.",

      "selftext": "Didn't know who else to ask and I came here because overall I trust this group. \n\nMy boyfriend and I have dated for 5 months now and been friends for 14 years. We met back in college and had so much in common that we became fast friends. During our mid 20's I moved away to pursue my music and modeling career so our friendship became more distant but we always kept up with each other. \n\nAround 7 years ago when I came back we got back in touch. At the time I was dating a guy who consistently had cheated on me, so I let him talk me into an open relationship. Initially my ex wouldn't let it be open on my side, but I begged and begged as it only was fair. He spent so much time with other girls I felt it was only right to hang with another guy while he was busy with other dates.\n\nHe finally agreed so long as I never spoke of the other guy and I agreed. At the time my now bf was also in a bad relationship. She too cheated on him all the time and at that moment she had gotten together with her ex husband while dating him. He wanted clarity on the relationship but she wouldn't give him an answer so from his view she was more or less dating them both.\n\nMy boyfriend and I started with just hanging out and playing board games. We would talk about our situations and compare what we were going through. It was the same in a lot of ways and very therapeutic to realize we were not alone. I admitted I hated having a poly relationship and he admitted he was monogamous too, but he was in love with his girlfriend and afraid to lose her. She was very beautiful and also his first. Not really his first long term serious relationship but more so the one who took his virginity. \n\nI loved my ex too and didn't want to lose him either so I could understand. At some point we decided to sleep together, fwb since we both were in very unhappy open relationships. As time went one we got closer and hung out more. I even started to get feelings for him. I told myself if he seriously asked me out and wanted a relationship with me then I'd dump my current boyfriend for him. \n\nAt the time my confidence and self esteem were super low and I told myself again and again that nobody would ever love me like that however, that I wasn't good enough. Because of that when my ex got jealous I want spending more time with my now bf rather than him, he demanded the relationship close on my end and I go NC. I did, because I wanted to be respectful to my relationship with my now ex. It took another 6 months until I finally snapped and broke up with him due to how he treated me. \n\nThe last 7 years I avoided all men, going to therapy to work through a LOT of trauma and trying to be happy and healthy alone. My now bf reached out to me several times but I stepped away and avoided reaching out, afraid to get stuck in a fwb situation again which I would not accept. \n\nFinally when I felt ready to date again this year I got on sites and generally all the guys failed my standards as I keep them very high. I am so happy alone that anyone subtracting from my life wasn't worth my time. I was happy to say if nothing was found this year I was going to delete the app and continue to live my dreams. That was until a tragic situation happened. My bf ended up reaching out to me for drinks to talk about it and I figured it would be nice to hang out again so I accepted. \n\nThat night we hooked up and I figured it was what it was, but he quickly texted me the next day asking if this could be more than fwb. He really wanted to start an exclusive relationship,  we would make it official to everyone after a set number of dates which we burned through fast. \n\nHe admitted to me some time after I vanished he broke up with his ex because he knew how a real partner could be. After that he dated a few people but nothing ever super serious aside from me. Hearing I was sort of his \"the one who got away\" felt nice, and I am happy I was the reason he realized he deserved better because I had told him that so many times while it was happening. \n\nSince we started dating its all been perfect, the only real drama is unfortunately during this time of the year he works for his ex as a second job the same festival I work. We hang out when we can there but I can tell his ex is being weird. Like she didn't care for 7 years they were broken up until he got a serious relationship. \n\nI really don't care they work together, I trust him, I don't trust her which isn't my problem, it's her bf problem. My bf has always been honest since day 1 with me about that whole situation. \n\nYesterday when we were coming home from a date however was the first time in a long time I felt that self preservation snap back into my brain. We have talked about in the past how our lives would be had we gotten together seven years ago instead of now. I think part of him wishes that had been the case but I brought up that I'm happy we didn't, because coming out of bad relationships we needed time to heal, go the therapy and grow. \n\nYesterday I finally admitted that I didn't actually think back then he would give up his ex for me either, because other than her being toxic he truly and deeply loved her and she's gorgeous, pretty much desired by everyone where we work. His response was \"Yeah, she has lots of issues.\"\n\nI don't think this should be something to bother me but it did. It made me feel I was justified in not really thinking he was going to ask me out back then, made me feel a little less like the one who got away and more like, the one who was just in the right place at the right time. I had expected him to say something more along the lines of \"I wanted to ask you out, or I thought about it.\" Instead it felt more like \"Yeah, despite her issues I stuck it out with her over asking you out.\"\n\nMaybe I am just misunderstanding which is possible because I am autistic. Maybe I am just having some issues arise from my past dealing with a relationship with infidelity. Maybe some part of me is just nervous being with a partner who is working with his ex even if I don't feel like I really mind it. I'm not sure what triggered these feelings or if any of this is a red flag in the relationship. I might be unintentionally spiraling and he's done nothing wrong at all. \n\nMaybe opinions from other betrayed partners and dealing with these moments with new partners would be helpful right now. \n\nEdit: thank you, I think I have the right course of action I need.

We have objectives to accomplish and we are all pitching in. To a guy marriage is more personal. This is something I do for and with “my woman”. A man would do all the household stuff not because he wants to, but because of the woman. Something like that. So then if  he discovers that she wasn’t really “his” the whole thing falls apart.

      "selftext": "For more context, see my earlier posts: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/oh4UC3BJSf\n\nMy favorite part of the day, every day, used to be when my BF got home from work. I WFH so I have very little human interaction. He was my safe space; my rock. Now every time I wait for him to come home all I can think about is how, for months, (that I know of), he was spending time with someone else at work pretending to be “working late”. Even though, I know now, his work had a hard stop at 6, and we live 10 mins from his work, he’d get home daily closer to 7 pm.\n\nWe dated the majority of my 20s. I think I’ve been buying into the sunk cost fallacy. I’ve been discontent with him for years, waiting for him to grow up, become financially stable, choose a career and follow through with it, so we could finally get engaged and married. According to him, his fear of failure and the pressure I put on him was too much, that’s why he went for this other women’s attention. Someone who was beneath him (his words,\nnot mine). \n\nA couple of years ago I moved states, he came with me and left his family behind. I thought that was a sign of love but maybe it was just attachment. I bought a house in my hometown and he lives with me. I pay the majority since I make more $$ since I work harder than he does and worked to get to where I am. Putting myself through school, getting into competitive internships, etc. \n\nYesterday he bought us lunch for $15. (As he should, IMO). Then later offered to pick up my prescription that I’ve been putting off picking up bc of my severe anxiety. I thought that was thoughtful. He then came home and complained about having to pay $30. Saying he thought it would be fully covered. He said “you could have done me the courtesy of letting me know I’d have to pay for your prescription”. I thought paying SOMETHING was common sense, but I guess not. \n\nThis was my moment of realization. Do I want to live like this for the rest of my life? With a man who can’t fathom paying for my prescription or who thinks he’s paying too much for me bc he spent $45 dollars on me in a day?? A man who CHEATED ON ME and STILL has the audacity to complain over petty $$ for things that are necessities? \n\nWhen we talked he said “you’re the breadwinner” almost implying that bc I make more $ he shouldn’t have to pay for things for me, ever. It was such a slap in the face. When I pay for the majority of the bills. I pay to maintain the house and for all renovations (ofc since it’s my house), I pay for the furniture and decor (even though we live together), I pay for all my own things, etc. and we only split groceries and some utilities. He pays some rent, yes, bc if he didn’t pay anything the resentment would be CRAZY. But still, this to me doesn’t seem like a man who wants to be a husband. The alarms are going off in my head. \n\nAt this point, even though it would SHATTER ME completely to leave him. It has been heavy on my heart. It was hard enough trying to work through his betrayal, but now I’m reminded of all the ways our lifestyle and values are also misaligned. \n\nSo how do I do it? How do I break up with someone I still love, but I don’t think he’s my person? We live together and his family is states away. I want to not have to see him once we break up, it will be too painful. I’d like to maybe stay with my parents while he gathers his things. But for how long? I’m also afraid I won’t be able to break up with him face to face. I’m terrified. It’s been almost a decade since I’ve ever had to end a relationship. I feel so lost and hopeless and sad. ",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone, I'm new here and wanted some advice.\nMe (28 years old), him (32). We have been engaged since 2014, so for 11 years and we have been married and living together since 2022, for 3 years.\nSince we were kids I've always told him that I don't like him having girls in bikinis (unknown) on social media, whether he likes them or anything. We always argued on my end and he always told me that I was making things up, that he didn't write to girls or have sex online or anything.\n\n2025: \nJanuary: I catch him writing to a girl if he had telegram. In the meantime we had signed up for the mortgage on the house. Of course he denied it to death until I told him I knew. And there he confessed, however, saying that it was the girl who asked him (she didn't know that I had proof 😭).. well, whatever the case, what a big argument and I asked if he was sexting or anything else online or if he needed something else or if his feelings had changed for me. Obviously denied, he called me crazy while I cried and told him he made me feel worthless. And he replied to make a decision since I was the one accusing him. Okay no comment. I get all the cell phone passwords etc.\nStupid as I am, I thought I was exaggerating and that, having never had proof, he was someone who loves me, because he is always romantic, he cooks for me and he is a perfect man.\n\nAt the end of February I discovered that I was pregnant but I saw that this time I saw that a girl wrote to him, he asked for her number, he asked to show something and so did she. I download the app they used. He caught me checking my cell phone but other than asking me why he didn't get suspicious of anything.\nI was at work and I see that on this app you send intimate photos. He didn't know it but I saw everything.\nI show up at his job and he denies everything. That they never exchanged anything. Who after the last fight knows that he would have been crazy. (I'm stunned) Until I tell him that I also have the other app and I've seen everything.\nAnd I tell him I'm pregnant.\n\nObviously he was speechless. He says he's never done it before and it's the first time. \nI won't let you imagine that then I discovered that he had been sexting with others on Telegram for a few years (obviously I didn't know and I had proof), but he admitted that it was true.\n\nWhat do you think? \nI know very well that out of respect for myself I shouldn't stay with someone like that just for the baby or the newly purchased house. And that someone who admits just because I have proof doesn't deserve anything. \nBut on the other hand I see a man who acts like a boy just looking for sex. \nI actually don't know if he has ever cheated on me physically, who knows, how he lied so far he might have done so and lied to me.\nI would like to understand this behavior. He says he loves me, he cares, he's kind, he wants a family etc and then…?",

We had a really raw conversation at it was truly the first time I saw how broken down and defeated he looked. \nMy d day is 1/2/25 and I probably got maybe 75% of the truth initially. I reached out to his AP and she was surprisingly empathetic and kind (she didn’t know he was in a relationship/ expecting a baby) and provided clarification of what happened/ when. Over the next few months I got trickle ‘truths’ here and there and each detail cut even deeper. One detail I was caught up on is the use of protection. WP said they had sex once and used protection. But knowing him and how reckless the whole situation already was I just knew that wasn’t the case. To me it’s very important to know if he had unprotected sex then continued having sex with me while I was pregnant. Last night I gave him one more chance to be honest about the use of protection and he started crying. He said him and AP had sex multiple times, unprotected and he came in her each time. Then continued to have sex with me obviously never disclosing this information.

      "selftext": "Hi there. I (28F) and my boyfriend (30M) have separated recently (and I mean 5 days ago) as he cheated on me with one of his coworkers within the last two weeks of our relationship. We have been together for 6.5 years, he had a ring and everything, and I’m completely gutted. He went from crying on his hands and knees to now basically agreeing we need to be separated and that we both need to build ourselves up before we try anything again. \n\nI know this is the right answer, but it feels like another blow to the chest. Although he cheated, the mere fact that he may move on or sleep with other people or anything now just makes me physically sick and unable to sleep. I lay up at night shaking because I just don’t know what to do. \n\nAlthough we are separated, we are still at the same house since it’s the best financial option for us both, and unfortunately the market around us is just not something that I can easily find somewhere else to live right now. It’s eating away at me, is he talking to her at work again (although he claims he doesn’t want her and she was truly just giving him attention and he gave into it). \n\nWe weren’t in an amazing spot in our relationship, but idk it’s like how is he the one saying now that he needs to take time and grow you know? It makes me physically ill and all I do is lay around wondering who he’s texting, if it’s her, if he’s going to go and hook up with other people or now if he’s going to meet someone else. We’ve established boundaries for the house and no bringing anyone back there as long as we both live here, but idk. I’m physically sick, I can’t sleep, I am dying in the inside and he seems to be functioning completely fine, which kills me even more. \n\nWhat do I do? What can I say to myself? Other people who have been through this what have you done? I don’t want him to find anyone else, and his “level-headed-ness” if that’s what you want to call it is just killing me more as it feels like he doesn’t want to fight. He has issues with communicating, doesn’t know how to express himself and goes through deep depressive states and says he is going to go to therapy and stuff in this time. But just the fact that he may meet someone else while I can’t even stomach the fact of seeing a new person is making me sick. Please help.",

      "selftext": "Hey there, I've been reading this reddit because it comforted and distracted me a little bit from this overwhelming feeling of replacement and betrayal I feel, it's been drilling in my head through everyday and it's worse when I wake up in the mornings, the thought of imagining her what she has done behind my back is so cruel and unfair, and here I am, suffering from something I couldn't control. This happened 3 days ago by the way.\n\nI can't actually believe this day is happening, I always wanted to be with this person and already had a future planned, yet even I realize there were things that weren't reciprocated.\n\nI don't want to share the story down to the last detail cause everytime I think, write or talk about it makes me feel worse, but the fact is that she has been feeling uninterested in our relationship secretly for a few months, and instead of communicating with me she decided to cheat. But more importantly is that she gaslight and shifted the blame unintentionally to me\n\nSaying I was with my phone when we were together (mb for minding my business sometimes), or that I play videogames the last day before I went back to my country, and she also wanted to have much deeper and tighter hugs... All of these things she told me made me feel like she blamed me that this didn't work out, when it's obviously HER who, being 20 years old, and STILL cant properly manage her emotions or speak through them. For what are you gonna cheat on your partner of a long term relationship just for you to go with someone who was gonna stay for 10 days and then go very far away? Nothing is making sense to me and I'm afraid to be consumed by this injustice. I am a very kind and positive man but this betrayal, I'll never forget, and I want to avoid getting bitter and angrier.\n\nI decided to cut off with her, and let her some time alone to think about herself a little more, but I can't be with a piece of trash like that. Now I just feel slightly lost and all I wish now isn't to get back but to be in peace.\n\nUpdate: 1 week has passed and I actually feel much better than I expected. Still waking up strange with a bit of pain in the mornings, but everyday I realize more and more my own worth, and worthlessness of my ex, I still wish her the best.",

      "selftext": "Husband cheated multiple times 7+ years ago. We did a lot of therapy and healing on both ends. Originally during therapy we spent a lot of time digging into the cause of the affair. Our relationship was in a good and normal state. It was kind of blamed on ADHD (dopamine chasing and impulse control issues) and being an alcoholic (although sober.. not working any program) causing him to be rooted in selfishness and a lot of other layers. \n\nAnyway here we are, years later. We now have 3 kids. His behavior choices continue to destroy me, even if he isn't cheating, he teeters on the line of breaching trust. I continue to stay but it impacts our intimacy and relationship negatively. Recently we had a discussion about the initial affairs and very specifically the impact it has on me 7 years later.  I've come to find out his recollection and perception of the CAUSE of the affairs are very different than reality. He basically told me I wasn't satisfying his needs at that time & that's why he stepped out. Justifying it while also blaming me.\n\nI'm not sure how long he has been viewing things differently than reality. I'm not sure how to process or feel about it. He's obviously retracting accountability while also gaslighting me. Into thinking something is true that isn't. I obviously told him that's not correct etc \n\nI've been asking him to go to therapy and aa meetings for years. \n\nI'm not entirely sure what I'm asking for from this post- just to not feel alone and if anyone has experienced this ever. I'm just a little in shock and not sure how I feel other than alone. Thanks for reading. ",

He has borderline personality disorder and throughout our marriage, he was emotionally manipulative, unpredictable, and verbally abusive. On Easter Day, I found out my mom had been sleeping with my husband for over a year and a half. Since then, I filed for divorce, kicked him out and cut her off. She swore it was done, swore she felt horrible, swore it would never happen again. But here I am, finding out they’re still fucking.\n\nRight now, I’m in such a dark place. It feels like she killed a part of me I’ll never get back. I’m grieving not just the end of a marriage, but the loss of my mom in the same breath. It feels like I don’t have a mother anymore and that’s a pain I never expected to live with. I’m posting here because I don’t know how to carry this. How do you even begin to process when your mom betrays you in the deepest way possible? How do you heal from losing both a partner and a parent at the same time. Not from death, but from their choices?\n\nIf anyone has ever gone through something similar, or even just has advice on how to cope, I’d really appreciate hearing it. I feel so alone in this, and I guess I just need to know I’m not the only one who’s ever faced something like this.",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone,\nI don’t really know how to start this, but I’m in a lot of pain and need some outside perspective.\nI’ve been with my girlfriend for 6 years. Back in March, I found out she was cheating on me in a really brutal way — posting on multiple adult sites, sending personal videos, and talking to multiple people. I was devastated, but I loved her and we sat down and had a “second chance” conversation. She promised me she was 100% committed and that what she did wasn’t who she really is.\nSince then, I’ve been struggling with major trust issues. I admit I’ve made comments I shouldn’t have and checked her phone. But I’ve also been trying to work through it with her every single day.\nOn top of that, she has serious health issues (Sjögren’s syndrome, POTS, and other conditions), and for years I’ve been her main support — helping her in the bathroom, shower, meals, everything. I’ve done everything I could to be there for her.\nYesterday, out of nowhere, she had her dad and friend come move her out of my house. She blocked me on almost everything and said she “needs time to think about whether she sees a future with me.” After living together for 3 years and spending basically every day together for 6 years, I feel completely abandoned.\nI’m torn. Part of me wants to chase after her, show up with flowers, beg her to come back. The other part knows I need to respect her space and see if she actually chooses me. I told myself I’d give her up to 3 weeks of silence, but every day feels unbearable.\nI’ve isolated myself for years because she was insecure about me having friends, so I don’t really have anyone to lean on except my 71-year-old dad (who’s supportive but doesn’t really understand how to help).\nHas anyone else been here — giving someone a second chance after betrayal, only for them to walk away again? How do you handle the urge to reach out? And how do you know when it’s time to stop waiting?\nThanks for reading this. I’m just scared, heartbroken, and don’t know which way to go.",

I am exhausted. In some ways, I feel like he has taken many steps for reconciliation (therapy, being more present with me and the kids, starting sex addicts anonymous), but he remains adamant that he is being honest and never acted. I have read so many stories about truth trickling and I see many gaps in his story, and I don't truly believe him. \n\nI finally told him that for my mental health, I need him to move out so I can process my next steps. He found an apartment and will move out next week. My kids will stay with me but he will come over on certain days to help and see them. I am so sad that my kids have to experience this and we will be greatly impacted financially by the 2nd rent, but I need space to think.\n\nThere is a part of me that wants to believe he could be telling the truth. I told him that without truth, there is no way to rebuilt, and that being honest is the first act of love even if he loses everything.  Last night, he continued to deny and said he is being honest and never acted on his fantasy despite all the facts (failed polygraph, Google searches). I can't even have this conversation with him anymore. It breaks me. \n\nThere is this nagging voice in my head that can't help but wonder if I am forcing him to leave, separating him from our kids, and I could be wrong -that it was just fantasy. I can't stop thinking about it. Part of his therapy process will be a full disclosure, but I am almost positive he will just stick to his story.\n\nI need support and advice. Is it possible he is being honest? Is there any way for reconciliation in the future without truth or is this really the end? How can I tell the difference between truth and truth trickling? Feeling lost.\n\n\n\n",

The 'AP' was a literal nobody, some weirdo on the other side of the world that he entertained which makes it worse somehow. It should've been the easiest thing in the world to give me the basic respect I deserve and shut it down before it turned inappropriate. He was tempted to throw it all away for *that*? Absolutely nothing.\n\n\nI'm sorry if this reads clunky. I'm struggling to work through my feelings and kind of word-vomiting it all out. We have an 8 month old that still breastfeeds every 1-2hrs through the night and I'm perpetually exhausted. Most days, I don't know whether I'm coming or going. \n\n\nI am being intentionally vague with details because it's upsetting. On one hand, there was nothing physical.

Of the 2 weeks gone since DDay (I don’t know if I’m using this term correctly) I have had my daughter 4 nights, I had a lot of emotions going on and had to organise time off work so I couldn’t be there as much as I wanted to. \n\nToday she came for the night but refused to go to sleep for me and insisted on having mum. I tried for 45 minutes but she wasn’t budging and she started to get quite sad. So I got her mum to come grab her. \n\nI just feel so defeated by the situation. I can’t force my daughter to want to stay with me, it’s not her problem.\n\nI feel so shanked, I haven’t received an apology or any remorse from my ex-girlfriend. I feel like I’m being tortured.\n\nBut I’m proud of myself, I’ve been working out relentlessly, eating very clean and haven’t touched any alcohol (my usual coping mechanism).\n\nI spoke so highly of my ex-girlfriend to so many people, it’s so embarrassing to tell them what’s happened. I feel so stupid, I always thought I was able to read people. \n\nAnd the conversations we had while she was actively cheating are so scary to look back on, marriage, houses and more kids. How can you have a wedding Pinterest board while actively cheating on your partner, that’s just so far out of my scope of morals, I couldn’t imagine. It’s all leaving me quite speechless but here’s my rant nonetheless.\n\nThanks for reading. <3",

We both work in health care, my schedule is 6am to 3pm while she does four 10s from 9 to 7.\n\nSince I am an introvert and with my problems in bed, I was more aloof and kept to myself. She tried her best to have sex, have physical intimacy and communicate with me but I literally ignored her since last 10 years. We had our fights and arguments over trivial issues whenever we spoke. \n\nMy parents came over from India to stay with us for a few months in 2019 and things got worse between us, she was staying out of the house for long hours. My mom and her had several fights and both my parents had fights with her. She complained to me about them. She confessed to me in 2019 that she had a physical relationship with her married coworker for a couple of years. She said she was sorry and would never do it again but asked me to work on our relationship. She asked me to go with her to counseling and therapy but I ignored. I enjoyed my alone time watching tv/ movies etx and we grew apart further.\n\nFrom 2021, we were friends with another couple ( a little younger to us-4 years or so). Their kids were same age as ours and had fun together. We started getting together with them often, weekly nights and had drinks and good time together. Meanwhile, me and my wife didnt communicate much, we had our fights. The guy ( guy in our couple friends) was very social and had great sense of humor. He was good friends with me and he and his wife would come over and four of us even went on trips and 2-3 vacations together. \n\n\nLast year, I came to know that they got divorced. The guy was out of touch with me for a few months after their divorce but was back in touch beginning of this year. He reached out to me and came over to our house a few times and met me outside for lunch a couple of times. He said he was feeling lonely since he went through a painful divorce. Meanwhile, since last month, my wife mentioned to me that she was going to be out overnight one day with her friend. I knew she was seeing someone but had no idea who it was. \n\nLast weekend on her birthday, she said she wanted to go out again overnight. I asked her whom she was meeting and thats when she confessed that she was involved in a very serious relationship with the guy. ( our friends). She told me that he was emotionally there for her all through ( since last 3 years) and they were meeting outside and had sex many times. \n\nI was heartbroken and feel like a mess. She says that she is deeply in love with him and wants to marry him but he is not ready to commit. He makes much more money than either of us. She says she wants to divorce me sooner or later since I was never a good partner, emotionally or physically ( I didnt engage with her physically since last 4-5 years, we have been sleeping in separate rooms). \n\nI feel guilty that I ignored her and now its to the point that I have lost her. She told me that she has stopped thinking of me as her partner since many years, she is checked out and has no interest in maintaining this relationship. She said she will continue to go out overnight on weekends to meet him. I have realized my mistake and want to be a better husband to her but its too late now. I am depressed and feel like a piece of shit. \n\nShe is very attractive and beautiful. I feel like I was in a deep slumber lost in myself, work, dad duties and ignored her. I also feel bad that she was in a relationship with my close buddy and I never knew about it all these years ( he kept meeting me even till last month). I feel like I am worthless but I dont want to divorce her because I love our kids and want them to have a normal childhood with both parents. \n\nShe is a great mom, does have a good bond with both kids, shes very social and has a lot of friends, she also works an side job in healthcare on weekends, so we hardly have time together. I know most people will say divorce is the only and best solution and she also wants it, but I am very emotional and cannot do it. Please share your thoughts 🙏",

We’ve both have been visibly unhappy and our physical intimacy was infrequent (1-2 a month). \n\nShe later admitted they went for lunch (during office hours) but didn’t mention how many times, and that she had purchased a gift for him. I later found lingerie and a bunch of sex toys/lube in her closet. In her purse I found a date night card game, and also a condom.

      "selftext": "For context, read my first post sharing the infidelity: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/pluP9YB0zP\n\nMy partner had an emotional affair (to my knowledge never became intimate physically) with a woman who worked the front desk at the hospital he worked at as a technician. \n\nI found out in February, after valentines (where he exchanged a small gift with the AP). Again, context is in the first post. \n\nOf the 7 years we’ve been together, we’ve only officially lived together the last (almost) 2 years.I bought a house and he lives with me. Since I found out about his emotional affair, I’ve decided to go to couples therapy with him to try to figure out how this happened and to see if this is something I can move on from with him. We were already in couples counseling when I found out about his affair, except that was pre/marital counseling (Smh) that then shifted into betrayal counseling. \n\nI am trying to work things out with him since we have a lot of history and I’m also generally happy with him (outside the obvious affair and betrayal). However, I am open to the idea that I can change my mind at ANY time and end the relationship. I’ve been open about this with him. \n\nIt’s been bothering me that his affair partner is getting away with this whole ordeal. Moving on with her life like she didn’t flirt with my bf and spend time with him most nights when he was off his shift, while she finished her shift. My partner told me he even reminded her at one point that he has a gf and doesn’t want to jeapordize it. Her response when he told her that was to say “don’t worry, you’re doing great. We’re just friends” and patted him on the back. But proceeded with the constant flirting, compliments and daily chats/hangs at work. \n\nAccording to my bf 33M,This woman he was having the emotional affair with 33F, told him she was living with her high school sweetheart. She would always tell my bf how she never got to experience a deep romance or any butterflies since she met her partner in highschool and they’ve been together ever since. Her partner is also Black and she’d make weird comments to my bf saying “it’s funny my bf said if I were ever to cheat on him it would be with a white man”… sort of hinting her interest in my bf (who is a White Latino). She is a white Latina. Just weird comments… like my bf told her he got us an Airbnb for valentines and told her I wanted a hot tub but he said he doesn’t like hot tubs in the Airbnb bc it gets hot and it’s weird. She made a sexual innuendo saying “oh I could make it fun 😉”… Again, my bf told me all this after I caught him. \n\nWhat’s bothering me is that her long time high school sweetheart is essentially a provider for her. She lives at his moms house, acts likes she’s this loyal loving person. And he’s none the wiser. \n\nNow, it’s totally possible that MAYBE they have an open relationship or maybe she was honest with him since day one about her flirty relationship with my partner. I only say this, because I recognize that I’m not in their relationship and there’s different strokes for different folks.\n\nI feel like my bf having this emotional affair is a sign that he lacks integrity. And I think one way to start having more integrity is to own up to his actions and message her partner/husband, to let him know he’s sorry for his part in everything.\n\nOur therapist said it’s a bad idea because we don’t know how he will react or if he’s dangerous. Hence, why I have not acted on this. But I would really appreciate your insights. I just know if I was the one who didn’t know what was going on in this situation, I would want someone to tell me so that I could make my own decision with that information.  \n\n",

      "selftext": "TLDR: I’ve just learned that my husband of 10 years has been soliciting sex and sexting partners on Reddit, dating apps, and escort websites for the last ~5 years. \n\n2 years ago, a friend found his dating profile and when I confronted him, he said he was hacked and it wasn’t him. I believed him. I stood up to my friends and family for him. Well I just learned it was actually him and he had went on multiple physical dates. He says they never even kissed, but how am I supposed to believe that? Our relationship was really struggling at the time, so part of my understands. My mental health was so bad and I pushed him away, but I needed his support, not his infidelity. He continued the behavior after we reconciled and after our relationship grew and flourished. Until the last couple weeks, which I’ll get to in a moment. \n\nWe’ve had an issue with him lying about strip clubs for years now and we’ve worked really hard to build back trust. However; I also just found out he’s actually kissed a stripper and has gone more frequently than I previously knew. He even has at least one’s number. He last went as recently as this past weekend even after multiple conversations where he agreed he wouldn’t go again and would just say no.\n\nThe part that bothers me the most is the solicitation of sex services online. I had previously caught him chatting with someone he’d met on Reddit and sending her money like 8 years ago. I won’t lie, I had cheated on him emotionally prior to this so I was not too surprised. We’d worked through these issues until we hit another rough patch 3ish years ago when my mental health declined and he became completely absent. Or so he says. I found messages on his Reddit soliciting sex as long as 5 years ago. These messages included asking for and actually planning a threesome with a random couple,getting scammed out of thousands of dollars (right after we bought a new house), asking women to write his username on their naked body, asking for a “long term sexting partner,” paying for nudes and sex tapes from strangers, seeking out Reddit pornstars, and more I don’t even want to get into. There were multiple messages of him mentioning he was planning to divorce me or that he’s married and looking for a “princes to spoil.” Apparently he’s into BDSM as well.\n\nAdditionally! I’m finding out he’s solicited services from escorts. I found screenshots of his conversations with them, coordinating what services and for how much. I found one as recently as last weekend. When confronted, he just said he was looking at porn online. Totally brushed past the question of escorts. \n\nI am not asking for advice on what to do, I really just need some support because this is the most horrific situation I’ve ever found myself in. I still love him somehow. How?! Part of me thinks he may have a sex addiction or a porn addiction. Because there’s no way someone can tell me they love me, say they are working on our relationship, and then do what he’s done. I am lost and broken and my entire world has been shattered. \n ",

      "title": "Trying to reconcile with my (28F) husband (28M) after infidelity",
      "selftext": "I have a detailed post in asoneafterinfidelity laying out the timeline of my relationship w/ my husband; in summary, we have been together since we were 19. He has an extensive history of abuse (physical and emotional from his family, sexual from a teacher who groomed/raped him for 1.5 yrs starting when he was 16). He was my first serious boyfriend and I am his first healthy relationship. He was quite emotionally isolated when we first met... he is very, very distant from almost all his immediate family members and is actually the \"black sheep\" because (shocking reading the below info), he is the most well-adjusted member and the only one who has actually set boundaries with his parents ever. He now has close male friends and is close to his sister.\n\nIn the 9 years we've been together, there have been 4 instances of infidelity: him meeting up with his ex (they dated when they were only around 15) without my permission when she was seeking him out for advice after a break-up (I was aware they were talking/texting and had no issues with that at the time), him not shooting down flirtatious advances from a woman he was selling marijuana to but also not flirting back, him downloading texting apps to sign up for sites like SextPanther but never followed through on actually talking to them, paying for messages/photos etc. (confirmed by me combing through his financial records), and most recently, him allowing a coworker to flirt with him for about 2 weeks (only via WebEx, they do not work in the same physical office), then flirting back over texts for a day.\n\nThis most recent instance was particularly painful. He sent these texts on a Thursday; I had my medical school graduation that Friday, and we closed on our house the following Monday. I found the texts about 12 hours before we closed. It was very weird. They flirted in a way that I would say wasn't romantic or sexual but playful banter/overly friendly (ie he called her a natural in court with a winky emoji, she COULD NOT stop complimenting him and talking about how she was his biggest fan, how he was her only friend in this city (she just moved to our city in March), and complaining that they never hang out). He deleted the texts. She kept texting him over the weekend and he responded very dryly/coldly until she started basically asking him for marijuana; he told her he'd bring some over when they hung out at her apartment, and then immediately told me they made plans to hang out and invited me to come with. This is obviously what made me think ??? and why I snooped on his texts. He told me he knew the flirting was wrong and he hoped by letting the conversation run dry and bringing me to hang out with them she'd get the memo and they could just return to having a regular friendly relationship. Obviously, once I found the texts he told her to talk to him about work-related matters via WebEx and only if absolutely necessary and they have had 0 contact since.\n\nSince this happened in May, he has been doing intensive individual counseling and we have just begun marriage counseling. He has been extremely remorseful, we've had HOURS of conversations together, and he is demonstrating a refreshing level of self-awareness. He is finally admitting that all of these transgressions had the same 3 issues: his dishonesty, difficulty establishing appropriate boundaries with women, and a desire for attention/validation from women. He recognizes this is a horrible combination that could lead him to infidelity. Even with his ex who was not necessarily giving him inappropriate attention/validation, he had a lot of guilt for how he treated her (strung her along, gave her money for an abortion when she got pregnant but refused to accompany her to clinic, etc). This happened back in 2018. He thought helping her out during a hard time would help acquiesce his guilt; so it was ultimately still a selfish decision to try to stroke/soothe his own ego that overrided the fidelity of our relationship.\n\nHe is committed to continuing therapy and likely checking in with his individual psychotherapist at least once a month for years down the line--additionally, he has an open phone policy, he is being very forthcoming describing any remotely friendly encounters with any women, and we have established very restrictive boundaries for him. By all accounts, he is doing everything right for R and I recognize that other people go through much worse infidelity.\n\nBut still, I am so resentful. Why did it have to come to this? I was ready to divorce, as mortifying as that would be since we only got married last spring. I am shocked how easily trust has actually been returning. I've asked for couples counseling before (just last Nov), I've asked him to have clearer boundaries with women before (2018ish) and he wouldn't do it until I was thoroughly broken and ready to walk--and now magically, now that he is actually listening to me and caring it's been shockingly easy to re-establish trust and have the hard conversations he's been avoiding for years.\n\nI do not know what to do. Some days I feel hopeful that we can move forward in a healthy manner, and some days I feel like the resentment is just too much and unfortunately he's going to have to use his new skills and self-awareness to make some other woman very happy.",

      "selftext": "In March 2020 I divorced my cheating ex husband (serial cheating) for years, I left him in January.\n\nI tried for over a year begging him to stop cheating and he wouldn't stop seeing his affair partner and started staying with her part time. So after I finally mustered enough self respect to leave and make him move out after 2 years knowing about his infidelity kicked him out and filed for divorce He still will not leave me alone. He will not stop calling me (he is blocked but I can still see it if I have another missed call in my call log) If I check my blocked messages it is non stop- (I love you, I want to take care of you, you can have a life where I'm always here for you, where we are together, where we travel, you are so pretty, I miss you, I can't breathe without you). And tons of photos of me from the past saying I love you you are so beautiful. It is making me concerned a bit and worried and also feeling bad that I'm ignoring him but idk what else to do...He made his choices to cheat on me and not respect our marriage and somehow he thinks I'm supposed to forget it happened and step down to accept his bad choices? \n\n\\-He still wants to be with me and the other woman. He LIVES with her. He wants to live with her part time and be with me, still be in a weird polygamist relationship.. I am confused because I have been so clear about my boundaries and not tolerating this. It has been over 8 months since he moved out and nothing has changed in his opinion of me and him not being together. He seems like he's losing his mind a bit?\n\nI'm genuinely baffled, I have not encouraged this thought process and been clear with what I will and will not accept. Is he delusional? Or is this manipulation? He was very psychologically abusive so I realize i am still breaking this pattern of gaslighting and invalidation he's doing to make me doubt myself. That's why I'm reaching out for support to set my head straight. ",

      "selftext": "So I was reading about Dante’s Inferno recently, specifically the circles of Hell.  Basically, there are 9 circles, with the 9th being for the most egregious sinners. \n\nWikipedia explains it better than me:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferno_(Dante).\n\n‘The circles are concentric, representing a gradual increase in wickedness, and culminating at the centre of the earth, where Satan is held in bondage. The sinners of each circle are punished for eternity in a fashion fitting their crimes: each punishment is a contrapasso, a symbolic instance of poetic justice’\n\nThe sin of lust makes an appearance as the 2nd circle\n\n‘In the second circle of Hell are those overcome by lust. These \"carnal malefactors\" are condemned for allowing their appetites to sway their reason. These souls are buffeted back and forth by the terrible winds of a violent storm, without rest. This symbolises the power of lust to blow needlessly and aimlessly: \"as the lovers drifted into self-indulgence and were carried away by their passions, so now they drift for ever. ‘\n\nBut guess which sin the 9th is reserved for….?  That’s right, the sin of Treachery!\n\n‘At the base of the well, Dante finds himself within a large frozen lake: Cocytus, the Ninth Circle of Hell. Trapped in the ice, each according to his guilt, are punished sinners guilty of treachery against those with whom they had special relationships.’\n\n‘As they denied all human ties, so are they bound only by the unyielding ice. This final, deepest level of hell is reserved for traitors, betrayers and oathbreakers’\n\nI just found it fascinating how the idea of being betrayed by someone close to you has been considered the very worst sin that one can commit for hundreds of years at least, probably thousands. Hopefully that makes the betrayed feel a small bit better anyhow…",

I thought he was the love of my life. The betrayal absolutely broke me. I don’t know if there was more than emotional cheating, but I found our from other people that they were hanging out 1:1, while crushing on each other, and my ex kept these hangouts a secret from me. I don’t tolerate any lies or secrecy, so I ended it right there, and they started dating almost immediately… Funny, because he used to say she is just a coworker, and that I am being dramatic of even thinking there is anything more.\n\nI thought that after the summer vacation I would be over it… but now that I’m back work, and I have to see both of them almost every day. It feels 10x worse than before my vacation.\n\nWhat makes it even harder is the new gf’s behavior. She smirks at me constantly, makes little passive-aggressive comments (like if I share something about my life in a big group, she needs to her (often negative) opinion, like no one asked), and even copies my style/behavior??? The last one is maybe the scariest part. I feel like she is trying to be me with her new clothing choices, makeup, etc. Even trying to seem more bubbly and adventurous than she really is. It is cringey. When I was with my ex, she flirted with him in front of me, wore revealing outfits, and then, without my knowledge, invited him to hang out behind my back. Now I’m stuck seeing them both, and it reopens the wound daily. What’s more they try to clear their image by organizing these social after work events for our team 😂 They have never been the type of people to organize those, of course, I don’t feel like going to them, but now I feel excluded from other team members.\n\nThis genuinely feels like trauma. I cry after each work day, I get rageful, I shake. My whole nervous system reacts to the point I cannot relax myself during bedtime, and my sleep sucks. I even feel like I’ve developed trust issues and I don’t even want a new relationship anymore because of this betrayal.\n\nI’m trying to glow up and move on with my life, but being forced into proximity with them feels unbearable. The office feels like hell. I hate seeing them both. This woman is clearly insecure and tries to trigger me. I have tried meditating, yoga, everything and nothign works. I don’t know how I can move on from this.\n\nTL;DR: Ex cheated with a coworker, now they’re together and I have to see both of them at the office daily. She smirks, makes digs, and copies me. I feel retraumatized every day and can’t move on. How do I cope?",

      "selftext": "I just wanted to tell my story.\n\nLast June WP went on a camping trip with her best friend and thats when it happened. She came home and told me the next day. Said it was planned. She acted surprised when I got upset but like, she knew I wouldn't be ok with this or she would have asked me beforehand. I remember leaving to go walk the dog and get some air and hearing my parents voices screaming at me in my head (yeah, they were abusive), saying my reaction was uncalled for and nobody would ever forgive me for reacting like this over something so stupid. So I convinced myself that it didn't affect me, that it was between them, and the next day told her I forgave her and it wasn't a big deal, just don't do it again. And I said that it wasn't fair to let my insecurities ruin their friendship, which I believed at the time... and hate myself for now.\n\nI was already very good at pushing down that feeling that something wasn't ok. I thought that feeling was me failing. I felt like this was just the next phase of relationships, and relationships were work, and I needed to deal with my feelings. So they go on a another long hike together and I can't contain those feelings. Its fucking tough.\n\nSo he's going to run this marathon, and a month after dday, I attempt to grow a spine, or at least one vertebrae, and I ask her not to attend. She says thats not fair, I insist, and she breaks up with me on the spot. I storm out. When I get back she says she doesn't want to breakup, but still wants to go to the race. And this is the moment I replay in my head, every day: I say ok fine. I could have said to fuck off. I could have said delete his number and we'll talk. I could have said you just made your preference clear. I don't do any of that. We agree she can go to the race, but can't go to the finish line.\n\nThings nosedive from here. No prizes for guessing: she goes to the finish line. I say nothing. She continues flirting with him over text. I ask her to stop. Maybe she did, who knows. We fight sometimes. I'm constantly telling her that she's damaging the relationship, that I'm not ok with him being in her life in any capacity. Its all very abstract and intellectualized, I don't say \"you're hurting me\", or \"I'm going to leave\". We do sporadic couples therapy, its useless because I'm not in a place where I feel like I can even have boundaries.\n\nAfter about 8 months of this, I finally say its over. I'm a pathetic, shitty shell of a human being, and I didn't want to be any more. I'm glad I did, but I wish so badly I had done it sooner. The loneliness is hard, but the self loathing is harder. So I'm trying to claw my way out of the whole. I do feel better than when I was in that relationship. I think I did a lot more damage to myself than I was willing to admit by staying.\n\nI was in therapy this whole time, for what its worth. But I kept saying to my therapist this wasn't a big deal, that it certainly didn't count as trauma, and I had no idea why I was depressed. We also did a lot of work with childhood trauma, I ended up finally cutting off my parents as well, and likewise, I feel a lot better after that. So maybe the silver lining of this dumpster fire of a year was that I could finally start to wonder what it is I deserve, which is not a thing I would even have considered a valid thought before all of this happened.\n\nThanks for reading.",

      "selftext": "I will do my best to keep this post as short as possible...\n\nI have been married for 32 years to a man who has cheated on me (twice that I know of). He has traveled for work our entire marriage and I raised our 2 children mostly on my own. He first cheated 5 years into our marriage, when my daughter was a toddler and my son was still in diapers. I suspected it was happening but he lied about it and didn't come clean until I caught him cheating with a different woman 5 years later. He promised he would never cheat again and would make it up to me. He refused to go to counseling, but I made sure to go to therapy on my own after he blew up our marriage. I stayed because I didn't want my kids to endure the hardship of divorce, and I felt my husband's remorse was genuine.\n\nOur marriage has had its ups and downs throughout the years, and I thought things were just fine until a couple weeks ago when we met up with our adult daughter at a local bar for a fun night out. While waiting for our daughter to arrive, we encountered a woman who loudly announced that she was from out of town and was looking for a couple to swing with. I told her plainly that she would need to keep looking elsewhere. We wished her well and went to sit at a table. Our daughter arrived and we spent time together, but all throughout the night my husband kept getting up for drinks and talking with the woman, as she was seated at the bar. The woman even bought me a shot that I refused to drink. Towards the end of the night I had to make a solo trip to the ladies room. During my time away from the table, my husband went to close the tab. He chatted with the woman and they added each other on social media. My daughter watched the whole thing happen and ran into the bathroom to tell me. My husband was back at the table when I returned and acted like he hadn't done anything wrong. He was quite tipsy, so I drove us home. When I confronted him about what happened, he told me I was \"dumb\" and he only added her because she said she was remodeling an old farmhouse and he thought it was cool. I was very upset, not only that he added her on social media but because he called me dumb. I went to bed fuming and tried to have a conversation the next morning, only to be yelled at and my concerns swept under the rug. I have brought this up a couple more times and until tonight after me letting into him, he never removed her from social media, even after I had repeatedly expressed how his actions hurt me. \n\nThis is where I need advice. Based on my husband's brazen display of inexcusable behavior not only in front of me, but in front of our daughter, and him obviously not caring about my feelings or hers, I am now considering divorce. I am beginning to think that my husband has just gotten better over the years at hiding his cheating, and his mask slipped during what was supposed to be a fun outing. \n\nMy daughter knows her father cheated in the past and was disgusted by his behavior. She didn't want to tell me it happened but also wanted me to be aware. Had she not been present and saw this happen, I wouldn't have known. I don't pay much attention to what my spouse does on social media, but I do now. I can't trust him.\n\nI have no problem with starting fresh and us possibly losing our house, but I am not employed at the monent. I haven't worked for the past several years due to helping my mother after my father passed away, and due to some health issues that have recently improved. My husband and I are pretty deep in debt, have a mortgage, and have a very large dog that needs a big yard to run around. I have been looking for jobs, and that search has just been ramped up, but I don't know what to do. Part of me thinks I should give my husband the benefit of the doubt and let him make amends, and the other part of me says I am an idiot for staying because he has probably been deceiving and playing me all this time.\n\nIf this sounds like something you have experienced, and/or you were in a similar situation, what did you do?",

      "selftext": "I have a situation where my partner lied to me about something but insists it wasn’t cheating and that he didn’t want it. I know that the definition of cheating differs between couples but I don’t know how I feel about this specifically because I view it as unfaithful.\n\nA couple of months into our relationship (it’s been almost 2 years now) he invited someone over to his apartment and claimed he’d let them take his bed while he took the couch because they didn’t have a place to stay and were really sad after a breakup. I was suspicious of some things that happened at the time and it stuck in my mind for the past year and a half or more until I begged him to tell me truth. \n\nHe said he lied about what went on but that no cheating occurred. The other person was really drunk and sad and kissed him and he stopped it and said he had a partner, before giving them a hug to comfort them and then sleeping in the bed next to them because he didn’t want to leave them.\n\nThe other person said, when I reached out to them to ask, that the kissing was mutual and that they were the one to bring me up and stop it before cuddling in the bed to go to sleep. \n\nHe insists that nothing happened and even said that they’re glad the other person confirmed nothing happened. He said he doesn’t know if the other person thinks it was mutual but he knows for a fact that he stopped it all, and it would be wrong to do anything regardless because they were drunk. He was too I guess. \nHe said he could’ve kept lying to me and nothing was stopping him from doing so, but that he told the truth when I finally pestered him for it because he needed to get it off his chest and be honest with me because I deserved it.\n\nHe had also told me that he almost had a threesome with this person in his last relationship but that it never happened and he “wasn’t as into it” anyway, but they told me that it did in fact happen.\n\nI guess both have reasons to lie. But i’m more upset that he lied about what even happened in general with the sleeping arrangements and them trying to kiss him because I’ve felt so insane over the past year thinking about it.  \n\nI just have a hard time believing his side of the story because he did in fact cheat a few months before that, in a different way online with a friend. He admitted to that. And he said he didn’t bring this situation up or admit to it even when I asked when I found out about the other cheating (I found out after both of these instances) because he didn’t want to put more strain on us. So I have to feel like if I’ve asked so many times for the full truth about this situation that maybe the other person got it wrong? I don’t know. It’s been so long that maybe everything is foggy. ",

      "selftext": "Four weeks ago, my (F22) boyfriend (M23) of 5 years cheated on me for the first time. He kissed another girl when he was out. He felt comfortable with her and he kissed her out of him being emotional and uncertain about what he wants.\n\nThe context: for months, he’s been carrying a lot of emotional baggage into our relationship. He’s often told me he “doesn’t know what he wants,” and we’ve been stuck in a push-pull cycle:\n\n* He says he’s unsure.\n* I say he has to be all in, or we’re nothing.\n* We agree on a break.\n* I feel relieved and better about myself without the weight of his uncertainty.\n* He gets scared, doesn’t like seeing me okay without him, and comes back saying he can’t see himself with anyone else.\n* We recommit, and things are great — good communication, date nights, prioritizing each other.\n* Then the cycle repeats when he entertains “what if” scenarios about other women.\n\nThis time, it escalated into him actually kissing someone. He told me right after, and he was devastated. He deeply regretted it. You should have seen the look on his face — I even laughed at first, because I couldn’t believe he could make such a stupid mistake. He has always prided himself on being a “good man,” and now he says he hates the man he sees in the mirror.\n\nFor me, cheating is very gray now. If it had been a whole talking stage, genuine feelings, or sex — I’d be gone. But because it was “just” a kiss, and because he told me right away, I gave him the benefit of the doubt that it was truly a dumb, impulsive mistake. Four weeks later, he still says he beats himself up about it, he deeply regrets it, but he also puts in an effort to bond with me. He tells me he knows I won't forgive him for now, but I see he is definitely putting in effort to spend time with me and give me reassurance. It feels like we are going in the right direction, but I also am aware that it will take a while to let go of a lot of feelings. \n\nWe’ve agreed that if he’s serious about rebuilding this, **everything has to change.** He’s going to get professional help from a psychologist. I told him I don’t even recognize him anymore: he’s become impulsive, avoidant, always with people, always working, never reflecting, and he hasn’t been prioritizing me.\n\nNow I’m stuck on what boundaries to set while we try to move forward.\n\n* I’m definitely not okay with him being 1-on-1 with other women anymore. I never had trust issues with this before, but clearly he can’t handle himself.\n* I don’t want him going out drinking with his friends without me — but at the same time, his friends annoy me and I feel embarrassed because they know the situation. I also don’t want it to look like I’ve got him on a leash.\n\nSo my questions to anyone who’s been through this:\n\n* What boundaries did you set with your partner after infidelity that actually helped rebuild trust?\n* How did your partner prove to you that they genuinely wanted to change?\n* At what point did you start believing the change was real, and not just guilt or fear of losing you?\n\nI really want to rebuild if it’s possible — but I need to protect myself this time.",

      "title": "Perfect marriage turned into horror story of porn addiction, online local girls, nude exchanges, unprotected sex finishing inside, texting several daily. Meeting up when he said he was at the gym.",
      "selftext": "Recently found out husband (38m) of 12 years (im 40f) has been meeting up with local call girls having unprotected sex and also chatting with several over 6 of or 12 married years. He has lied about everything but came clean on only 1 porn girl physically after giving him hours to come clean, or he'd be kicked out of our house. We have an 8 and 10 year old. He has cried, saying he will do anything to save this marriage.  But his infidelity has been over the last 6 years minimum. We had a 2 and 4 year old when he had unprotected sex with the same porn girl 6 times, trusting she was clean and on birth control and finished in her each time. \n\nMy intuition tells me it's been weekly hookups with random online sex people all this time. He claims it was just one physical affair that ended 6 years ago, and the other few are nude exchanges via text, but these girls are local, too. I know it's way worse than what he's telling me because his story continues to change when I pressure him.  He keeps telling me I need to help him get better, and he will do anything to have me stay. I don't want to ruin our kids' lives by not trying (I know he is the reason), but I also dont know if I can stay for my own sake.  \n\nOur marriage in my mind was the best marriage out there. Great sex, he did everything around the house without asking. A goodbye morning hug and kiss before work and a kiss before night. Always planning family events and multiple vacations a year. Everyone always tells us they wish they will find a love like ours. So affectionate.  Flowers and small loving gestures all the time. He is so supportive of everything i do and is my best friend. He is present and all in every night and for every event for the kids, etc. I felt so loved.  I felt so special.  And now I feel so stupid.  He would go to the gym every day M-Thur after work, and that is when he'd meet up. But do I divorce him or stay for the kids if he says he will change. He already offered a location tracker and all access to his icloud and phone. I'm so nauseated by even being in this position. He said he's so sorry and has been in rare form for 2 days, saying he needs me to try, and he's been wanting to get help. He said he'd do both individual therapy and marriage counseling.  Is it enough? I dont even know who he is anymore.  I guess never did. I told him in 2 weeks that I'd reevaluate, but if I find out more than what he claims to be it, I'll want a separation and go from there. He said there was maybe more chatting going on where he was infatuated with some.  He gave out his phone number to all of them.  He said none of them know his name or anything, but all you have to do is Google his phone number and his name address etc pop up. I feel so violated. He is sticking with his story of only 1 physical affair 6 years ago over 1.5 months and then a few chats over the years with other local women through pornhubs website. While he's sticking with it, he hasn't denied it was as bad as my intuition says but hasnt admitted it either.\n\nSo. My life has crumbled in front of my face. And I know there's sooooo much more he isn't telling me but says he will do anything.  He did look physically unwell the last 2 days and has cried a lot begging me to stay and work it out and that there is no one else out there for him. Im the only one for him.  Manipulative behavior, I know. I told him i dont feel sorry for him, and he deserves all the pain.  Im so lost in this. How could my perfect marriage be a fake coverup to his sexual desires. I love my kids so much.  They are so innocent in all of this. It's been hard to mask my sadness. I told my husband I would try to work through things, but success rates aren't great, and my mental health and well being comes first. I dont know if I can let him go without seeing him follow through with getting help.  He is very goal oriented and motivated. He has an upstanding reputation with everyone he knows. The nice guy. The helper. But he obviously is unwell in a 2nd life he's living. The unprotected sex just sits heavy on me. He said he understood.  But does he? I'm crushed. ",

She was and still is a coworker. He and the counselor agree it's silly for him to quit when he has 4 more years til retirement (he'll be 45 when the time comes).\n\nThe anger I have is still there ... festering. It feels like a wound that is raw and some days it feels like there's more salt in it then others. This weekend, and today, is one of those days. I have so much resentment built up towards him. Sometimes I feel like I'm draining the remainder of my youth staying - I'm 32, he's 40. \n\nToday, I told him how I felt (\"I feel like we're headed back down the old path/the behaviors that caused the affair...\"). My insecurities are at an all time high because of the affair and he notices it (\"Youre so f*cking insecure since the affair\") - couple that with my questions for him, I'm being told by him, \"I feel like I'm married to a child\" with the constant reassurance. He's angry that his phone is now free game for inspection, he's angry that we use Life360 to keep track of one another, etc. He says he is annoyed with my constant seeking of sex - I can acknowledge I am doing this because I feel as if, if I don't have sex with him, he'll find it somewhere else. In the moment I am worked up (like today), crying and telling how I feel, I am met with comments that \"no other man would put up with this.\" \n\nToday, I tried to talk it through with him on the phone. He hangs up on me, saying there's nothing else he can say to reassure me an affair won't happen again. That's all he ever says. I call back - sent to voicemail.\n\nHe gets petty when he's frustrated at me. He's responsible for childcare pickup but has told me last minute that I need to ask to leave work early to get my child without any explanation for why he can't do it. He just thrusts it on me. Although on days like today, it's being used as a punishment - it comes off as him being as if I bothered him too much by telling him how I felt about the impact of his actions that because I wouldn't shut up about it, he dips out of childcare pickup duty. I now have to tell my team, abruptly and unplanned, that I will be leaving early today.\n\nAt what point does any of this get better? When does the anger stop festering? What do I do for the moments he is petty towards me about sharing how I feel about what has transgressed?",

      "title": "Does my marriage still have a chance or should I leave now?",
      "selftext": "About two weeks ago, I found out that my husband has been cheating on me for the past three months. We’ve been together for 16 years, married for 13, and we have two young kids. This is the first time in our entire relationship that his behavior toward me changed, and it was also the first time I ever suspected him of cheating.\n\nIt all started when he began a new job. The affair is with one of his employees. When I confronted him, I told him I wanted to leave, but he begged me to stay. He promised he would cut off personal contact with her but refused to change jobs or replace her (which I also recognize wouldn’t be fair for her career). He assured me he would show me his phone every day and not delete conversations with her since they still need to communicate for work, as they are based in different cities.\n\nBut even within the first week, he broke his own rules. I found out he was still messaging and calling her, and even went so far as to plan a trip, buy tickets, and book a hotel to meet her. He lied and told me it was a work trip, promising he would check in the whole time and prove he was alone. Of course, I didn’t believe him, but I played along. On the first night, I asked him to show me his hotel room, and it was obvious someone else was there. Still, he denied everything.\n\nWhenever I show him proof of his lies, he denies it. Recently, I even saw personal messages from her to him, and ever since then, he’s refused to show me his phone at all. His excuse is that it’s “hard to stop cold turkey” because they used to talk so much, so they’re still messaging, but supposedly not actually “replying” to each other. Now he’s telling me about another upcoming trip, which I’m almost certain is just another excuse to see her, but I have no way of proving it. Honestly, I’m exhausted from all of this.\n\nMy family is urging me to stay. They believe he’ll eventually end the affair since she is also married with kids, and her culture doesn’t allow divorce, so there’s “no future” in it. Another reason they want me to stay is because I’ve been a stay-at-home mom since our first child was born. The house is solely in his name, I have nowhere else to go, and finding work plus childcare would be difficult compared to the lifestyle he provides us now.\n\nWhen divorce comes up, he says he’s willing to go through with it. He promises he’ll continue paying for everything as he does now, that I can stay in the house, and that he would move out. But his condition is that he still wants to come to the house during the day until the kids’ bedtime, as if he still lives here. I told him I couldn’t accept that—because I still love him, and it would make it impossible for me to move on. I suggested instead that he take the kids to his place and we communicate through a third party, but since he doesn’t want that, he’s still living here.\n\nI know he won’t leave me on his own, but at the same time, watching him continue the affair is destroying me. I can’t focus on anything else, not even the kids, and that makes me feel like I’m failing them.\n\nSo here’s my question: should I stay in this marriage, hoping the affair will end and he’ll eventually come back to me? Or should I leave now, even if it means a huge lifestyle change for our kids? And for those of you who’ve been through something similar—what’s the likelihood that either of them will actually end the affair?\n\nUpdate: Thank you all so much for every single comment, it has helped me a lot. I would also like to read the book that’s been suggested here , ‘Leave a cheater , Gain a life’, but I am unable to buy the book because I would have to use my husband’s credit card. If someone has a link to a free copy that I could read, I would really appreciate it. Thank you ",

My answer was simple: I just don’t think I can.\n\nSince D-Day, I no longer see her as a wife, and I no longer consider myself married—the contract she broke destroyed that bond. The only reason I’m in R at all is to keep the family intact, not because I feel “married” to her anymore.\n\nThat conversation led us down a darker path: what kind of people do I see as “worse” than waywards? Honestly, I put WW’s in the strata just above people who torture POWs or rapists. To me, there isn’t much worse than a wayward. That’s how deep the betrayal cuts.\n\nI asked her who she would consider worse than a WW. She couldn’t answer.\n",

I'm trying my hardest to make it through every day, some days it's easier, some days like this week have been really hard. I feel dumb for not seeing the signs, and not having enough self respect to set clear boundaries. I am proud that I was able to walk away but still there is so much left that need's to be done.\n\nI wrote a very angry letter that was not sent, and had some very angry thoughts today for the first time. Maybe I am entering a new stage of grief. I don't know. Hope everyone out there who is going through this is able to find some support in this tough time. I've read posts about the pain lasting for years or maybe never ever really going away. I won't be surprised if that happens with me because I really felt like she was the one.

I would like to show my WH how and why “just an EA” is so much more devastating than he realizes. Not from books, videos, therapists etc. I want him to hear it from other women just like me, so he knows I am not alone or even the minority when it comes to “only an EA” ending a 20 year marriage. I’m going to post this and leave it for a while to allow time for responses, then discuss it with him.\n\nRelevant Details:\nEA was with a coworker and lasted 4 years. He treated me terribly during this time. I accidentally discovered the affair while looking for something else in his emails. He initially gas-lit and trickle-truthed. \nHe claims that nothing sexual happened and that he never wanted her sexually, there is no way to prove this because he deleted everything daily. Except for their email exchanges. He did not know that I still remembered his MacBook pw and thus was able to see his email account was still logged in and had been left open. There were sexual innuendos and flirting. He expressed his yearning to see her when she left for another job and talked about scenarios that he could make that happen without suspicion. He complained about me and his home life being a never-ending roller coaster. (Two of my family members had died during this time, one was my grandpa and he was my hero.)\nHe had her name saved as a man’s name in his phone. Been in R for 4 years, and it’s been torture for me. I do not wish to be with him anymore, although he’s a completely different and better person now. I just can’t do this with him anymore and he doesn’t understand.",

She tells me that she is still in love with me but says I’m not her person, and she’s been sleeping with someone else while we were together. I’m heartbroken—I love her so much, she was my only friend, and I can’t imagine life without her. I feel like it’s all my fault for not being open enough, but her lies crush me. It's complicated because we have a blended family of 5 kids, and they are all very close to each other. She proposed that we stay in the same house, separate rooms and continue to co-parent but are separated. I don't think I can do that considering the affair but for the kids it would be the best scenario. She blames me for the affair and shows no remorse. Has anyone healed from this kind of pain?

      "selftext": "I just had one of the worst dreams I’ve ever had. I don’t know why, I have been doing well for the most part and am even dating someone new for the first time. I consider myself to be in a good place at the moment.\n\nThat being said, last night, I had a very detailed dream. I was at some sort of event and saw that my ex wife was there as well. I went to talk to her and tried to ask how she was doing. I don’t remember feeling bad or nervous about doing this in the dream, just that I was curious. \n\n It turned into her berating me, calling me names, asking why I thought I was good enough to speak to her. I ended up leaving and walking outside, extremely upset. I walked around outside for a long time and for some reason ended up finding two baby deer. They were cold, huddled together in the snow, obviously happy to have one another to make it through the cold. \n\nI remember specifically thinking I needed to find someone to talk to, someone who I could use like the deer trying to stay warm. Support. I opened my phone and realized there wasn’t anyone. I went through names and every person had a reason I knew they wouldn’t want to hear it. And now that I’m awake, I see that these are real reasons. This is the reality.\n\nIn the dream, I took this information and figured there wasn’t much choice anymore. I pulled out a pistol from somewhere (idk, dream logic) and pointed it at the side of my head. I don’t remember pulling the trigger or anything, I didn’t jump or wake up or anything either. \n\nInstead, the next thing I remember is laying in the snow, unable to move, and Lily walks up to me. All she says is “fucking finally. I can finally be rid of your sorry ass” and then walks away. \n\nI stayed asleep at this point, just replaying parts in my head over and over until I finally woke up. This is the first time I woke up having obviously been crying. I’ve never had a dream like this, especially so detailed and remembered. I don’t usually remember my dreams. \n\nI don’t feel like I’ve restarted the pain of the discovery or divorce again or anything; this is different. I think I’m realizing just how alone I really am in this issue. I obviously am still unhappy with how things turned out, I’ve always known that. But I can’t talk to anyone about it because they think I should be over it already. That I shouldn’t care that I don’t know why it happened anymore.\n\nAnd I agree with that sentiment, but it doesn’t change that I do. And I know that I will never know the answer. I’ve been living with that semi-ok, but I think last night it really caught up to me. I just want to know why she hated me so much. Why she felt it was ok to do this to me. Why can I not just accept that it doesn’t matter and I’ll never know?\n\nEDIT: I’d like to add that I am not feeling suicidal. At least not consciously. It happened in the dream, but it is not something I am desiring.",

Last week I saw a text message on the lockscreen from one of his colleagues. it’s clear they are having an affair “I love you and miss you” etc. I took a picture of the text  but said nothing to him. \n\nIm still shell shocked. Altho we’d had problems over the years I’d never known him to lie to me or cheat. Our relationship hasn’t been in a good place since the birth of our second last year. 3 months ago he said he wasn’t happy and was thinking about divorce. We agreed divorce wouldn’t be feasible for our family and that we would make a serious effort to improve our marriage. Since then there have been improvements and he’s in therapy for the first time ever. We enjoy spending time w our kids together and have been trying to use our limited time at night to rebuild our connection. \n \nAP is married w kids and we socialize with her family in group settings 1-2 times per month. She’s smart funny and looks a lot like me. Altho she and I aren’t friends, we are friendly. There is no way her husband knows. \n\nIt’s been a week and I haven’t said anything. I don’t know what to do. \nGiven my concerns about divorce below should I even confront him? Has anyone here done that long term? \n\nI worry confronting him would push him to actually file for divorce which I don’t want. He’d fare much better than I would with one , and the support from his family financially and emotionally would cushion him from the impacts of divorce. \n\nWe live in a no fault state. Although we both work full time I make more money. Id owe alimony and child support. He has local family support and wealthy parents. My family is a plane ride away and isn’t. He’s a good dad so 50/50 custody. Our budget is tight. My salary is what allows us to pay for childcare. Our mortgage has 2% interest and we live in an extremely HCOL area. Also given my job the time I see my kids at night and during the weekend is limited. It would break my heart to have to split that time in half. In short, I neither want nor could afford a divorce.  \n\nSo in short… should I not confront him? Or should I confront him and gamble that he’d actually get rid of AP and not our marriage? \n\n",

I got pregnant again in September with fertility treatments (clomid and IUI) and just had a miscarriage two weeks ago. I had to have a d&c and am still recovering (I cannot have sex, but my husband and I have still been sexually active.) Last night he was with some friends and then dropped one off. Usually he lets me know when he is heading home, but I texted him that I was going to bed at 10:30. The text was not delivered so I thought oh weird, and I got a bad feeling. So I called him, straight to voicemail. My husband and I share locations with each other. So I looked and he was in an area of the city I don’t recognize. He texted me back like 20 minutes later and then we got on the phone and talked said he just dropped off his friend and he was driving back. I asked him why his phone was off and he was like “it wasn’t I’m not sure I guess I didn’t have service driving over the bridge.” He came home, I was in bed and went to sleep, I woke up with a bad feeling about it. I messaged his friends wife and asked her when her husband (that my husband dropped off) she said 9:30, there was a missing hour. I went through his phone, it was so clean, then I looked at his calendar, I saw names and numbers in an appointment. I googled the names and numbers, escort service. \n\nI confronted him about just the missing hour and he admitted to the cheating. He cried and was super remorseful. He is going to go get help, but honestly I don’t know what else I should do. I feel like I’m at my lowest low. I told him I love him but I’m putting all this work into starting a family and he is putting his and my health and safety at risk. I want to stay with him. Im looking for any advice or support because I also feel extremely isolated and don’t feel like there is anyone I can go to with this. \n\nThanks for reading.",

      "selftext": "i just have no idea what is going on and what kind of evil human i was in my past life to deserve this kind of karma\n\ni found out literally 4 days that my boyfriend (27M) has been cheating on me (25F) for the past 6 weeks or so, so both the affair and the news are super fresh\n\na couple months ago i was raped after a night out, this random guy came back to the house with my flatmate and another guy she had picked up at the bar, we mistakenly assumed he was a friend of the guy and the guy assumed he was a friend of ours. i guess he wanted to make sure he was in the running to be chosen by my flatmate and when he wasn’t he decided to take it forcefully from me. unfortunately since it was my birthday, i and my flatmate were drunker than we planned as strangers and acquaintances in the club had been buying me drinks and i was sharing them around with my friends also\n\nbecause we were so drunk neither of us kicked him out, there was a major miscommunication about it. i went to my room by myself and fell asleep and left my flatmate and the 2 guys talking because they weren’t yet ready to go to bed. my flatmate told me after he was asleep on the couch already when she went to bed but i guess he woke up and made his way into my room because at some point i woke up and there was a stranger on top of me with his arm around my neck. i pretended to still be asleep until i was able to ”roll over in my sleep”, i put a knee up in between us and he left me alone and then promptly left in the morning\n\noriginally i wasn’t going to tell my boyfriend because i didn’t go to the hospital (i had no immediate physical injuries to treat, and i was in shock and hungover i didn't really grasp what had happened to me straightaway) and i didn‘t make a police report because i figured out none of us knew who this man was, where he was from, what his name was even so i just felt it would be impossible to find him. and it was pointless anyway, like i said i had no physical injuries so he would easily have been able to turn around and say it was consensual and i was just accusing him now because i regretted it\n\nanyway i did tell my boyfriend eventually because i felt that if he found out, if it slipped out somehow from me or one of my friends he would have been furious i hadn’t told him. he didn’t quite react the way i needed or wanted, i completely understand he needed to process it but i needed support from him and instead i got kind of suspicion from him as he felt i should have gone to the police and the fact that i didn’t was maybe a sign i just cheated. but we talked about it, he decided to believe me and tried to support me (or so i thought)\n\nfast forward to now, i haven’t seen him for a while, we’re long distance and i was doing clinical placement for my uni course. but this weekend i went to see him and we went to a festival together. the morning that i’m supposed to fly back home i get a message from a random instagram account asking if the boy on my story was my boyfriend because this person had been seeing him for about 6 weeks and sent me screenshots of some of their messages\n\nit turns out she went to his city on holiday, he went out with his colleagues to a club and got separated from them and this girl approached him. that night they just kissed but they exchanged phone numbers and continued to speak. at some point he travelled to her city to have sex with her, he even brought her to the same festival he had brought me to just 2 days beforehand and had sex with her again after in her hotel room\n\ni was absolutely furious, heartbroken, in shock, etc. we have been together for over 4 years, it will be 5 years in december. i thought this was the man i was going to marry, my friends loved him, my family loved him, we clicked almost immediately after meeting, he truly was my person, my biggest supporter, so loving and so caring. i am completely shocked that he would ever hurt and betray me like this. as soon as she sent me proof i confronted him and he admitted it, apologised over and over again and has been begging since then to try to work it out. he says that its not an excuse but his reasoning/mentality for doing it is because i was raped. that even though he made the conscious decision to believe what i told him had happened, that he couldn’t ignore the thoughts in the back of his mind which caused him to lose sexual feelings for me but not emotional feelings. he cheated with this girl because she gave him attention at the right time, that he wasn’t attracted to her or connected to her emotionally and for him it was just sex\n\none thing that hurts me though is that the weekend of my birthday he was supposed to come but his sister got into a car crash (she was fine) and wrecked the car. even though i know logically its not his fault, i did resent him for that because if he had made the effort to get a bus or train and come anyway i wouldn’t have been raped that weekend. and contrast that to the fact that he was able to make the effort to get on a train to her city to have sex with her. if it was just sex he would have gone on tinder and found someone in his city to have sex with right?\n\ni haven’t told many people except for my 2 best friends and my mum as i don’t know what i’m going to do. a part of me wants to try to fix it, i feel i owe it to myself to try and see if its salvageable because i loved him so much and he seems genuinely sorry and remorseful. as i said he has been begging to fix it, crying on the phone to me, telling me he wants to go to therapy to get to the root cause of why this happened, has answered every one of my intrusive and invasive questions about what happened and how it happened. i told him that i need time to think, i said if we were hypothetically to stay together i would need certain things from him (paying for couples therapy, not allowed to meet up with friends that knew about it and facilitated it/encouraged it, not allowed on nights out or holidays without me for the foreseeable, he makes all the effort to visit me in my city for long distance, access to passwords and accounts, location at all times) and he has promised he will sacrifice his personal life and privacy to prove to me how sorry he is\n\nwhat i’m struggling with is whether i want to be that kind of person, i’ve always had insecurities from past relationships but i’ve never been the obsessive type that needs to monitor their partner and i worry whether i will be able to come back from this at all. i don’t want to try to make this work and in 6 months i realise i can’t do it and go through this heartbreak again. i don't want to try to make this work and in 6 months he realises no amount of therapy can ever change how he feels towards me sexually because he can’t get over what happened to me and then i go through this heartbreak again. but equally i don’t want to end it and regret it in 6 months and try to get him back\n\nmy mum and my 2 best friends have all been cheated on at some point in their pasts and have all said to me separately that they don’t think i should give him a 2nd chance but that if i do they recognise that it is ultimately my decision and none of them will have any judgement towards me, i’m incredibly lucky that i do have such a good support system for what happened to me on my birthday and with being cheated on. obviously since its so fresh i won’t be making any rash decisions and i need to sit and stew on this for a while, probably a month or 2 at least but i’d like some objective advice or opinions if anyone has any",

      "selftext": "Hi, everyone. \n\nMy (30f) husband (30m) dropped D-Day on me two months ago. The incident happened well before he told me. Attempted to cheat out of self destruction/severe depression/ fueled by alcoholism and projected issues, thought he might as well be the terrible person he believed he was, yada yada, was rebuffed and told to own up to it by the person (whom he doesn't even like or respect) or she'd tell me, neither did for over a year.  Yay.\n\nI left, crashed at a friends, and returned the next day with plans for divorce. We squared it all up and then I left for other events I had that day. \n\nThen, we started talking openly. He didn't even make it 24 hours before he realized just how badly he fucked everything up. It wasn't love bombing, it was him finally snapping out of the terrible mental health space he put himself in for years of our marriage and realizing he needed help and to change. That it became easy to blame me for everything and refuse to take accountability. \n\nAfter two emergency therapy sessions (thank you, therapist) we both realized that we genuinely wanted the path of reconciliation, not sure where we would come out at the end but hoping to improve ourselves and support each other through it. I've always been a \"scorched earth\" kind of gal with cheaters so this is all new to me, as well. Both feeling like this and attempting this path.\n\nGuys, I hate how this one incident was one of the \"best\" things he ever did for either of us. We've both grown so much already, I see him finally facing his issues and working on them one on one and giving me the partnership I've needed for years to improve my own. The further we get into this the more I realize that there's an actual chance we could move past this. That the person he was doesn't deserve my forgiveness but if he can actually stick to it and keep going then the story might be different in a few months. \n\nWe are, of course, seeing one kick -ass therapist, too. We know this isn't the path to \"fix the relationship\" and neither of us want to. What we had was broken, fueled by our own trauma and a lack of understanding. All this to say I'm committed to this path, it feels right, and that's all I need to keep on it for now.\n\nThat said... It doesn't hurt any fucking less. It doesn't erase that the person closest to me tried to step out of our marriage and then not only hid it from me for a year but was extremely self destructive the entire time while I was mad scrambling to be his support never knowing the entire time that the reason behind it was his own guilt. \n\nIt's going to take a LOT of time to process all this. I've been open about the fact that I do not forgive him yet, that I'm hurt in ways I can't even articulate, but that I'm choosing not to throw it in his face every other day because that's what feels right to me. I don't want to be that person anymore, and if there's a chance that either of us can come out of this as friends or still partners, I think it's very important that I don't. That I communicate my pain in better ways. And my therapist and I have plans on the path to closure in the future, when we're ready. Guided talks to allow myself to express the hurt and have him listen and understand without just throwing it at him. I want to feel heard and understood, not vindictive. We've already been doing it in small doses, just honesty without the barbs. It helps.\n\nSo far, I've been ON TOP of that. But there's some days where it's just hard. I've started calling those the \"no forgiveness\" days. Days where I just want to turn and scream and cry and hurt him as badly as he hurt me. Usually before I'm on my anxiety meds for the day. \n\nIf anyone here has gone through a similar path, no matter where you landed at the end, how did you get through those moments? I never deserved this, and there's so many things to work through I'm taking it all one day at a time with a lot of personal success, but those moments are hard. At least this kicked me out of my victim mentality at last: I didn't deserve this, his actions weren't my fault, and although he might \"deserve\" to be hurt by it that's not what I want to do. I want to be a better person at the end of this, and this is a great playing field to practice when and how to respond to pain. To communicate and give him the space to actually listen. My therapist and I are working on it. \n\nThank you for reading. Hugs for everyone else on this path. If it was anyone else but him... I would be on a much different reddit right now, ready for my divorce glow up, but this is my path right now and I just need some perspective.",

      "selftext": "I think I just need to rant and get this off my chest to random people. My boyfriend of a year was cheating on me for months, I found out almost 3 weeks ago. since that day first I couldn't eat for a week, I was sleeping 20+ hours a day and I haven't left the house for 2 first weeks. right now I'm mostly staring into the wall.\n\nim 24. he was my first kiss, my first time and my first relationship. I found out he was cheating in a really stupid way, which just told me that he wasn't as smart as I thought he was. I kinda get his explanation of why, maybe that's due to my low self esteem and a thought that no one can truly love me in that way. I'm really torn, I want to forgive him because I know deep down that that was my only chance for this kind of human connection. I know that I'm dumb in saying this but I truly feel like the only thing that could happen in my life romantically is him. I told him that I would rather be alone all my life than with a man who has no respect for me but that was a complete lie. I want to give myself the grace of time before running back to him because maybe time will help me see that I didn't deserve this but I don't know. I kind of feel like I did deserve all of it.\n\nI really feel extremely humiliated and embarrassed but maybe that's all I deserve in life. I really don't know what to do with myself, it's been 3 weeks and instead of getting better it gets worse everyday. I can't even properly cry, I just feel sick and like throwing up every single day. \n\nI kinda feel like I shouldn't be alone but I also don't want to bother my friends all the time. it's better with someone but I also feel so empty, I know I'm not a fun company. i know my friends don't mind but I mind being a burden. \n\nI actually kind of feel like he's actually remorseful but what if it's only an act? he was lying for months. but why lie to keep me if you don't want me? I'm so confused. I don't understand anything. I really miss him. I blocked him 5 days ago on everything but I still check his account multiple times a day. I don't know how to stop. I want to puke when I look at him but at the same time I miss him so much. I know I have no self respect for wanting to get back with him but I really do. I really do I still want him and I don't know how to stop. I've been through worse things in my life than a guy missusing my trust but I truly feel so absolutely empty. empty and literally like I'm full of shit and the shit is him. I want to talk to him, I got so insanely attached to him. and I feel so dirty that he was my first time, that I wanted him to touch me, I feel so absolutely disgusting that he has seen me naked. I literally don't know what to do with myself I just stare into the wall for most of the day. He was saying he loved me all the time but my god love without respect is so insulting to me. I don't want to spend the rest of my life with a person who doesn't respect me but maybe it's better than being alone? it truly feels better than being alone.\n",

      "title": "25 days before our wedding I found out he was having an affair. We'd been together 9 years.",
      "selftext": "I'm devastated. It's been 10 days since I found out. I had a bad feeling something was off and one night I looked at the location history on his phone. He'd been going to one address multiple times a week when he said he'd been other places. \n\nWhen I confronted him he admitted he'd been seeing this woman from his softball team. She knew we were engaged, everyone on his team knew. Some of them were coming to the wedding, most of them also knew about the affair and looked the other way. \n\nRight away I started the wheels in motion to cancel the wedding and had to call everyone that was coming. We had 150 people coming and a lot of things we already paid for. \n\nI just couldn't imagine continuing, he had no plans of stopping or telling me. He says he cared about her, but he still loved me and wanted to marry me. \n\nI insisted he tell everyone in his life the wedding was off and why. He had to call his mom, his grandma, everyone. His whole family is flying across the country and most are still coming. The house next door to us is an Airbnb and we rented the whole place for them to stay. \n\nWe spent the whole first week crying and holding each other, I couldn't ask to him leave, I couldn't even say we were breaking up. My mind just couldn't catch up to reality that the life I thought I was going to have is over. He says he's going to go to  counseling, has been answering every invasive question I ask,  and has been more emotionally honest than he ever has. \n\nI finally asked him to go, to leave and stay somewhere else. He's been sleeping in our car and the nights he's been gone we still message all night until we fall asleep. I finally asked him not to  message me last night, even if I reached out. \n\nI feel so heartbroken and confused. Now we still have to get through the next few weeks for the wedding date to come and pass. His family who I love so much is coming to town. We still share a car. \n\nI'm slowly moving to plan my next steps. I'm going try and get a car this weekend. I planned a trip away to see my parents the weekend the wedding was supposed to be . \n\nMy biggest issues right now is that I'm obsessively ruminating about the AP, I hate her and have intrusive thoughts of the things I want to say to her. I actually drove to her house one night, luckily she wasn't home. I don't even know what I would of done if I saw her, I'm not a revengeful person, I just wanted to call her names and see what she looked like, what she had to say for herself. \n\nI know LOGICALLY that my rage is misdirected. She's not the one who broke an agreement with me. She can face her own karma. But I can't stop thinking about her. I sent her a Save the Date to her with an invoice for the wedding expenses. \n\nI just wish I could stop thinking about her. I can't focus on anything. I run a business and can't get the work done I need to. I had planned for two weeks off starting in a week but I have so much  to do before that happens and I can't afford more time off. \n\nI just feel so lost and incapable of doing anything. I've lost 10 pounds. The idea of staying with him feels impossible, the idea of breaking up feels impossible. \n\nI do have a lot of good friends and family checking up me everyday. They are my saving grace. If it wasn't for the wedding I would of been more private about this but I have told everyone now and can't turn back. \n\nI just don't know how I am going to get through the next few weeks, and then in October I'm scheduled to get a hysterectomy. \n\nI don't know why exactly I'm posting here. It just feels so dramatic and unreal, I'd love to hear from people who've been where I am. But I can't hear - \" you dodged a bullet\" or \"it will all work out\", that doesn't help. I know all that in my mind. My heart is just broken. \n\n** Updating for common questions, \n\n-Yes I did get STI tests. There is a whole other dimension of this that I didn't get into  but all the tests came back negative. I had him & her send me screenshots of the results. \n\n-Yes he's going to pay for the car. We were going to try and sell it and then I finally said no, I don't want to wait and deal with it. He doesn't have that much money but he has a good job. From what's left of our wedding savings and the money he gives me I should have enough for a reliable used car. \n\n- Yes I'm looking for a therapist starting Monday. \n\nThank you everyone who commented, it's hard to respond to them all, but I know you're right. NC and untangling our lives is the only way. It just feels like more than I can handle, but I am trying. \n\n\n\n\n",

Its not a suspicion i know for a fact they had an affair. I found text messages and confronted both of them and they came clean. I have broken up with my boyfriend and thrown him out of our apartment. (The text messages were her urging him that they need to tell me the truth btw)\n\nBut the issue is with my friend. Normally i would just cut her off. She is incredibly sorry and sobbed and begged me to forgive her. As i already said, normally i wouldn’t care but its a lot more complicated. She is a fantastic friend. Always there when i needed her and all that.\n\nBut the most important part is, that about 5 years ago she gave me one of her kidneys. She went through a dangerous medical procedure and accepted everything that comes with having only one kidney for me. I didn’t even ask her to do it. She insisted to get tested and then didn’t even hesitate to donate. She even had complications after surgery.\n\nAnd she never, ever, demanded compensation or for me to kiss her feet. She was just happy i was alive. And even now, she didn’t use it as an argument for me to forgive her…\n\nI am so lost. What am i supposed to do? She did something i consider unforgivable but she also is the literal reason i am still alive. And she was always my ride or die.\n\nI really, really need advice. Because this isn’t a situation i ever expected to happen.\n\n",

      "title": "Struggling with feelings from my wife’s affair",
      "selftext": "\nI (26m)found out my wife (24f) was having an affair in January that lasted to mid February, and it devastated me. During that time, I struggled severely and attended suicide prevention care. I had a heart attack at just 26 years old. When I first discovered the affair, I was already overwhelmed because I'd been working multiple jobs for two years to support us. I did this because my wife had physical issues since childhood that made it hard for her to work. I took on responsibilities to care for us and get us out of my parents' home.\n\nMy wife was manipulated by her male best friend, who made it seem like I was cheating on her. He got his friends to send fake messages to her, making her believe I was talking to other women. The affair started shortly after we returned from a Christmas vacation to visit her family—a trip I had saved up for.\n\nAfter I tried to harm myself, the affair didn't stop because he told my wife I was just trying to pressure her into staying married. It ended when I had a breakdown due to medication side effects at a mental hospital, leading to a heart attack. That's when my wife realized the truth because he admitted to manipulating her.\n\nWe've been trying to work things out since then. A couple of weeks after we started working on our relationship again, we found out my wife is pregnant. We checked timelines to confirm the baby is mine. My wife proved to me she didn't sleep with him with a prenatal test though she did send him photos. We've moved to a new state to heal, but I'm feeling overwhelmed by memories of what happened and I just don’t know how to move past everything for myself her and my unborn\n\n\nI want to clarify to anyone reading this that it might seem like I'm defending my wife or that she's not taking full responsibility for her actions. But she has taken responsibility. She's told every member of her family about what happened. She's been open about everything and is trying her best to show she's sorry for what she did.\n\nShe completely cut off contact with the other persons involved (friends and other man) the day I confronted her. We sat down together, and she told me when the affair started. She even let me read through all the messages to prove what happened. She proved that she didn't have physical relations with him because he lives more than 24 hours away.\n\nThe other person was hoping to cause me so much pain that my wife would leave me and move to be with him. He said in his own words that he was a better match for her than I was—even though I was the one who married her.\n\nBoth of us come from families that were torn apart by adultery—our fathers were involved in infidelity. And I'll be honest, I was very promiscuous in high school. My wife had fears about me repeating those mistakes because of my past. She didn't talk to me about these fears or confirm them with me because if she knows you well and you show her evidence that looks real, she tends to believe it. This guy had known us for a long time and was able to mimic things well.\n\nThere's no excuse for what happened, and my wife understands that. We've been working hard to fix things, but there's something in me that won't let me forget.\n\nYes the kids mine tests prove it no she didn’t sleep with guy unless he can fuck her through a phone screen plus she doesn’t own a car so he would’ve had to come to my fathers house to do anything cause and that means pissed off marine and cop greeting him with the entire property lined with about 65 cameras no he fully wanted her to sign papers to leave me then pay for her to move in with him in states away.",

      "selftext": "Hello. I thought I'd share my story here for a little bit of support and advice.\n\n\nI (BW F43) have been married to my WH (M 45) for 15 years, together for 21 years, no kids by choice.\n\n\nI thought we hit a rough patch in our marriage somewhere at the end of last year because our communication had dropped off suddenly and the affection was almost nonexistent.\n\n\nHe was actively disengaged from me and at times downright nasty and mean during this time. I just put it down to stress about finances etc.\n\n\nAs of last week it has been a year since we were intimate. In a desperate bid to save our marriage I brought him to an island paradise twice to try and rekindle something. Once in November 2024 and then again in late June 2025. Nothing happened on both trips and I felt absolutely destroyed after the second trip.\n\n\nI handle everything at home; cooking, cleaning, the care of our dogs, laundry, groceries. On top of working 5 or sometimes 6 days a week.\n\n\nHe put zero thought into my birthday this year so I kind of shut off and decided that I was not going to bother anymore.\n\n\nBut something just didn't sit right with me.\n\n\n1 month ago I went on his laptop to try and figure out if there was some kind of kink that he's into that I could maybe try to bring the spark back into our marriage. I don't wear rose tinted glasses about corn-usage so I was open to this.\n\n\nThat's when I found several prompts to Google's AI. They were all related to some other woman. When I confronted him with it he initially lied to try to cover up and when I presented the proof he caved in and confessed that he had gotten tipsy on evening at a work event and kissed an external vendor.\n\n\nThis had happened in November 2024 when I was recovering from a major knee surgery. I remember when I was warded in the hospital, he didn't even want to stay over with me, despite me being a fall risk and the ward being understaffed. Even when he was at the hospital room, which was comfortable for a plus one to stay over, he'd be constantly on his phone. He had spent maybe altogether 5 hours with me the total 3 days I had been warded.\n\n\nTo think that I brought him on an all-expenses paid trip just weeks after makes me physically ill.\n\n\nWe went through the whole gamut of hysterical bonding in the first 2 days of finding out. He claimed to feel so much guilt and cried buckets and made all the right noises. Then we went to therapy.\n\n\nApparently he has ED (even 🌽 doesnt help him sustain) and he's already on testosterone so hopefully his individual therapist can help him.\n\n\nAt this point I vacillatate between trying my best to be forgiving and looking up divorce lawyers and singles flats. In 3 days time it will be 1 month since DDay.\n\n\nHe tries to help out around the house and has been overly affectionate and present.\n\n\nBut I can't help but wonder:\n\n1) What kind of person would even think of messing around when their spouse is recovering from surgery?\n\n2) What would have happened if I had never found out?\n\n3) What if all this is just too little too late?\n\n\nI was always very vocal about how cheating is a deal breaker for me because my ex boyfriend cheated on me and he knows this very well. And it still didn't stop him from doing this. \n\nAm I really the sort of woman who will allow myself to be disrespected this way and allow the person who disrespected me to have another chance to destroy me again?\n\n",

He had been talking to them for a few days and wanted permission to meet them. I blew up; and after some investigation they were a scammer and he had already sent them $300 on an Apple gift card. This started a 3 day fight which ended with him in a mental health facility under an emergency detention order. After being medicated he returned to what I remember as my husband. The problem is he continued to talk suggestively to woman online. Sending nudes and sexting on telegram and WhatsApp. Asked him to stop being sexual with them; he didn’t just hide more. Told him he needed to stop all together and he said he would just say good bye and be done. The next day I received an anonymous email with screenshots of a conversation he had the previous night! These screenshots had nude photos of ME!! Also included a screenshot of him attempting to schedule a meet up that day! I confronted him and he admitted the person had blackmailed him and he refused to pay but “didn’t think he’d send them!” I begged and pleaded he stop, go to therapy, take his meds or I would leave. He agreed. I thought we were good. Until he asked me to get something from his email, and I found a email confirmation from a new dating website he opened the previous night!! After our fight!! I called him immediately and told him to pack his shit. \nI have no idea what the next steps are…",

When I went into work and got back  she had taken the kids and left back to Georgia and has not let me speak to or see my kids. She is treating me like I’m worthless and like I mean nothing to her. She has since moved in with her affair partner and taken both of our daughters to live with him all while basically abandoning me. I reach out everyday to talk to the kids and she either ignores me or says “stop contacting me it’s weird”. I filed for custody two months ago and our hearing is in September. I haven’t talked to my kids in months now. Does anyone have any insight or personal experience as to why someone would feel justified acting like this after completely destroying their family?

      "title": "My wife cheated last Nov",
      "selftext": "My wife cheated on me last November—less than two months after we got married—while I was out of town. I found out the following weekend and caught her in a lie. She blamed it on the fact that she’d stopped taking her Lexapro and was heavily intoxicated. She also put some of the blame on me, saying she didn’t feel emotionally connected anymore, thought I didn’t really love her, and felt like I didn’t know who I was.\n\nIn the past, she’s drunkenly told me things like: she hates that I make more money than her, she hates that I don’t have any “problems,” she hates that my stepdaughter and I have a better relationship than they do, she hates that I “tried to save her,” and that she’s used to being the one who’s “less messed up” in a relationship. While there’s some truth in parts of what she said, I also recognized a lot of it as projection of how she felt about herself.\n\nAfter the truth came out, we had deep conversations. She told me she felt closer to me through this, that she truly knew I loved her, and she expressed how sorry she was. She walked me through her thought process, said all the right things, and made me feel like maybe we could rebuild.\n\nIt’s now been 10 months. Not a day goes by that I don’t feel the pain, but I’ve been showing up every day and doing my best. She quit drinking in January, started a sober TikTok, and recently—out of nowhere—he reached out to her there. She says she “forgot” to block him, and by the time I brought it up, he was already blocked. She told me she just replied, “ew don’t like my videos,” and blocked him.\n\nThat knocked me right back to day one. I’ve been trying to explain to her that this isn’t “just TikTok” to me—it’s about the fact that he still had access and felt comfortable enough to reach out. This isn’t some random guy. This is someone she’s known since childhood, someone I’ve met, someone who knows her family. Now I go to family events wondering who knows, who doesn’t, and feeling like a fool.\n\nWhen I try to talk about it now, her responses feel cold—just “I’m sorry” or “I love you”—without the same emotional connection she had early on. She says she’s showing me she’s sorry through changed behavior and commitment. We’re even trying for a baby, though I can’t tell if that’s a way to show commitment or something else entirely.\n\nAbout a week ago, I came home from a rough ride back from a field visit and decided to open up about how I was feeling. Instead of empathy, she turned it around and said I have no hobbies, that she feels smothered, and that I’m clocking her every move or asking too many questions. The thing is—two weeks earlier, she had said almost those exact same things about herself, minus the “clocking her every move” part. At least she apologized for it later. \n\nFor the record, I don’t have her location, I don’t have her phone passcode, and I don’t even want it. She also keeps bringing up how, in the first two years of our relationship, I accused her of cheating or acting inappropriately. I told her I don’t want to keep bringing this up and make her feel like shit, and her response was, “Well at least this time I deserve it.”\n\nI don’t even know what to say to that. Every day I put on a smile and try to be happy, but I’ve never felt a pain like this. And with this latest thing, it feels like the wound has been ripped back open and I can’t stop feeling this way.

He's always struggled with drinking and depression that led to some scary times.   \n  \nSince that time though hes improved or so I thought because when I came back then I just kinda had a gut feeling something was up. I had just kinda checked over the house and when I went outside I found his phone and a drink and all of that stuff and went to go bring it inside. When I had lifted the phone the screen had turned on showing a notification from a dating app and I had scrolled through the notifications to find another dating app. Curiosity got the best of me and I was somewhat in denial of hoping he was just using it to find another guy to talk to for help but when I opened up the phone there were sexual messages and he invited the guy over with the final message confirming the guy had arrived at the house. I'm unsure of what all happened but I could find some alcohol around even though he should've stopped drinking and with all of that it's pretty clear he cheated on my mom. \n\nAs of now I am unsure of what to do. I'm currently 19 and feel like this may not be my place but at the same time don't want to keep something so serious a secret since my mom has to travel for her job. I don't want to watch my parents relationship crumble and I am unsure of who to tell this to first. Do I tell my dad and then try and deal with that or do I just go straight to my mom. Currently my mom gets home soon and then my dad leaves shortly after for his job. Sorry for this final bit being more of a rant but I need advice on what to do from people who have been in this spot.

We've had two dissolution dates and tried working things out but she kept reaching back out to him giving little pokes to what seemed like letting him know shes still here. Ive finally decided to walk away probably gave her to much of  my time and chances. We are going through divorce and since then I have opened myself up. To the degree of reaching out to the other betrayed spouse.\n\nShe was thankful I contacted her again ( I anonymously called her months ago to inform her husband was cheating on her with my wife) We talked a little and decided to meet up for coffee. I was able to fill some blanks in for her and likewise she did the same. We continued talking through the next two weeks and we ended up hanging out again more casual this time. Got some food, cruised around and ended up sitting on a bench drinking a little. It ended by me dropping her off at her house. The next day she wanted to hangout on her porch and talk. This ended up an all night ordeal of live music and hanging at her friends friend house where some affection and good time took place. As we got to her place I ended up staying where we only snuggled which honestly was more satisfying than if either of us made a move, I think it showed each other alot, anyways things are heating up and it has been quite an enjoyable experience so far. Seems like alot of chemistry.\n\nWhat a crazy circumstance to meet someone and it go this well. Lets hear some input.",

She would have late nights, come home at 7 or 8 in the morning, and disappear until morning after drinking heavily. She always brushed it off or deflected when I asked.\n\nYesterday she finally admitted the truth. She said she is in love with another man and that they have been sleeping together. She says they might get married someday. She told me I should be happy for her because in her words I was terrible to her for 10 years and that if I loved her I would want her to be happy even if it is with someone else.\n\nI have not even thought about dating since we split and I am certainly not having sex with anyone. So hearing this stings on a whole different level. To make it worse the guy is a former college athlete and much more handsome than me which is eating away at my self esteem.\n\nWe are still stuck in the same apartment until the lease ends. I cannot break it and she refuses to find someone to sublet. She is unemployed and not financially stable to get her own place. We live in separate rooms but for the last month we have still gone out for drinks and dinners together here and there. After this truth bomb yesterday my stomach has been in a constant knot and I wish she would leave for good.\n\nI feel completely disrespected and disgusted. I cannot sleep and I keep looping on what they have done together. How do you detach mentally when you are forced to cohabitate with the person who betrayed you",

      "selftext": "The breakup was 9 months ago. I’m in a completely different country now. Some days are good, some aren’t- like today. \n\nMy ex and I were together for two years. I moved countries to be with him (joined an expensive masters course to be with him as suggested by him). Like every couple we had our ups & downs. Anyway, he emotionally cheated and most probably physically too with his intern who btw is just a year younger. The girl also emotionally cheated on her then boyfriend. He broke up with me after the most happy moment of my life (birth of my niece). He told me she’s the female version of him, he wants to have smart kids like him with her and how they have more chemistry (they met 2 months ago at work.) I told him to not to bring her to our home\n\nThree days after the discard, he got her home to sleep. He told me how they had sex in the bathroom and how they had sex at work after everyone left. He compared our bodies and said I’m more beautiful but it’s refreshing to be with someone as middle class as him (I belong to a much well to do family). Even after I told him multiple times not to bring that girl home- he did. She intentionally used to moan loud multiple times and my ex told me they had been together a month and they hadn’t fought once. He tried hooking up with me which of course didn’t happen. \n\nMy mom came for my graduation and we had to book a hotel because that girl without shame used to come to our home. <all this happed in a month btw>. He never congratulated me for the graduation for the course I did for him, nothing. He could hear me cry almost every day when she used to come… still no shame. Just a bland “I’m sorry, I don’t know what else to say”\n\nI left that apartment without a word, I left that country. On Christmas his mom contacted me to apologise. She sent me messages that made me seen such as how he lost and angel for a vulgar characterless girl, how that girl won’t ever be welcomed to their home, she told her son he won’t ever find happiness and how she wished I was her daughter (she sent me multiple messages)\n\nThat guy never apologised, never asked me how I was doing, never asked me if I had left the apartment, he never checked up on me. \n\nAll I can think is did my love ever matter to him? Was I that easy to replace? Did the girl who had nothing but pure intentions for him and who was ready to leave her luxurious life back home for him meant nothing to him? Does he ever sit and think about his actions? He agreed to me he downgraded. \n\nDon’t get me started on the girl. I would never even think of doing what she did. How could she lower her standards so much. What about having little sympathy for the girl who’s home she wrecked?\n\nI wonder if they’re together.. \n",

      "selftext": "For full details you can visit [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cheating_stories/s/lSlyL9kAH0)\n\n  I am 28 years old male and my ex is 29 female after breaking things off. Things were quiet for a while as I grieved on my own. Three days ago her parents came knocking on my door again. I ignored them until they left .\n\n  However they didn't give up and ambushed in my office at the church that I work at. They brought to my attention that my ex has been starving herself and is now hospitalised. According to them she has been trying to refuse treatment and they want me to go meet her, as they put it ; they don't want me to get back with her and just want me to meet her. I told them that I would think about it but still haven't made up my mind.\n\nI no longer know what to think. My current thoughts could be summarises in\n\n I am starting to feel that she might actually regret cheating and perhaps reconciliation is an option.\n\nOn the other hand if she was this attached to our relationship why did she cheat in the first place.\n\nI still can't get the image of her sleeping with this guy during her one night stand out of my mind.\n\nUntil not long ago I was desperate to make her feel better during her period and it really pained me to see her in pain. and seeing her in pain and hospitalised might break my resolve regarding the break up.\n\nThe betrayal has affected so much that I am sure I will need therapy.  I can feel myself doubting my own mothers words just because she is a woman , if I choose to try reconciliation only to be betrayed again , I don't know how more messed up will I get.\n\nAdditional details not mentioned in last post that about how she ended up cheating :\n\nOne of her friends kept pestering my ex about how she is missing out by going to marriage having had sex with only me (she is the only partner I ever had too) , this friend of hers invited her to her house , they drank with this guy that is the brother of one of their friends , my fiancé couldn't get this friends words out of her mind and had a one night stand with this guy while under the influence.\n\nIf I decide to visit her and agree to reconcile my initial conditions so far are :\n\nPrenuptial agreement.\nNo more Alcohol.\nShe cuts this toxic friend out of our life.\nCounselling//therapy.\n\nI appreciate your feedback regarding this matter.\n\nShould I visit her or not?\nShould I give reconciliation a shot ?\n\n\nEdit First post text :\n\nFound out that my Fiancée from a relationship of 9 years cheated on me and I am livid\n\nWe have been together for 9 years , I have never felt more miserable and betrayed. We got engaged a little over 2 months. \n\nAfter the engagement I felt that our relationship became deeper but I was wrong ... the engagement had the opposite effect. \n\nI only found out because one of her friends told me about it. I confronted my fiancée and her excuse was that she was drunk , we were each others only sexual partner ... she was wondering how sex would feel like with different people and while drunk she made a mistake and had a one night stand with the brother of her friend. \n\nShe told me it was a mistake,  she never meant for it to happen and that we can still rebuild our relationship. I asked her if it felt good enough,  was it worth throwing away the 9 years we had together.\n\nMy heart aches , I can clearly feel a cold painful hole in my chest.\n\nWatching her cry only made my pain feel worse , but the disgust I feel when I look at her and the images of her with that other guy pop in my head is stronger. \n\nShe swore off Alcohol , promised to cut off her friend and her brother. Hearing this didn't make me feel better , any love I have is slowly turning to hate. \n\nI asked her to take off the engagement ring , pack up and leave my house. My family is disappointed in her and are supportive of my decision as her values and the values of our family don't match.\n\nHer family is split , her father thinks that a one night stand while drunk isn't enough to throw 9 years down the drain , while her mother understands my decision but wishes if we can work this out. \n\nFuck this , I don't think that I will be able to date or trust a Woman again.",

      "title": "[Edit] The ex who cheated on me is now someone else’s ‘right one.’ Were he and his wife in an open marriage? And did I misjudge him all along?",
      "selftext": "Just a note: I’ve shared a similar story before and repost.\n\nMy boyfriend hid the fact that he was married while dating me. Last summer, he suddenly distanced himself, moved to Arizona and we started doing long distance relationship for several months without any proper explanation. I was confused when he physically pulled away, but I stayed patient because I believed we had a future together. He told me he was living with a “roommate,” but that roommate turned out to be his remarried wife (He refers to call her as Jelly). He was married with Jelly for 7 years, divorced in 2022, and then remarried her in 2023. Then in 2024, while he was already married again, he dated me, pretending to be single. We’ve now been broken up for about five months.\n\nAnyway, he told me he had been divorced once and that he and Jelly were “just friends.” (But it was a lie because at the time he said that, we were long distance and he was already remarried to her.) I actually discovered Jelly’s Facebook posts last year(she doesn't use Facebook anymore) where she wrote, just a few months after their 2022 divorce:\n\n\"I’m happy that I had an oppportunity to live and love fullest with my best friend.”\n\nWhen I saw that post back then, I thought my ex must have been a good man, trustworthy, loving, someone worth believing in. But he hid his marriage from me until the very end, and when I confronted him, he told me of playing the victim and accusing him. Eventually, he blocked me everywhere without saying goodbye, without any explanation. That’s how our relationship ended, suddenly and cruelly to me.(He said our long term goal might be marriage once. I really thought this relationship would last. I was so naive.)\n\nSometimes I still remember the cheerful and lively hangouts on his Discord server, listening to him, Jelly, and his friends laughing together like everything was perfect. Photos and messages on Discord between him and Jelly from before 2022 showed real affection. Now they’re married again, and he plays the role of her loving husband and nice friend.\n\nThe man who threw me away is now a devoted partner to someone else trusted by his friends, respected in his social circle. I’m trying to come to terms with the fact that the man who abandoned me might be her most trusted friend, her “right one.” Someone who showed me cruelty can still be seen as loving, trustworthy, and precious in someone else’s life. I never imagined that a man who hid his marriage from me could be out there living happily with his wife of nearly 10 years. His longtime friends all love and trust him, and their relationships are built on deep loyalty and friendship.\nHe has many friends, and among them, the ones closest to him are proud to call him a friend.\n\nAnd I think Jelly might have known about me. Last year, when I was dating him, I once saw his roommate (who I now believe was Jelly) waiting outside his place until I left. Unfortunately, I couldn’t get a clear look at her face. I also saw a message from her that mentioned me. I can’t help but wonder. Did she know? Did she allow it? Was she in on it? Or was she just another person being lied to?\n\nps. Maybe, aside from the fact that he lied to me, he really is a good person to his wife and friends. Did I see his true colors? Or was the way he suddenly left me last year, and the fact that he wasn’t honest with me partly my fault too? I thought he lacked empathy, but is the reason his wife and friends never saw that side of him because he’s not actually like that? Honestly, there’s still this confusion inside me that I can’t fully explain. The fact that he’s loved by her as a husband…makes me wonder if I was wrong about him.(This occurred to me after read to other user's advice)\n",

I can’t point to anything I did to deserve it; I was supportive, gave him a child, moved away from my family, and chose him over other people I had been dating at the time (casually) without looking back. Now, despite his begging and pleading, I’m struggling to stay. I just need to understand why he did this—but he has no answers, and I don’t think I can accept that. It’s been months of couples therapy, individual therapy, and just trying to move forward and I just feel so lonely and lost. He’s reading the books. He’s going to the sessions. But I don’t love him like I did. I don’t know if I ever will. I look at him differently. He’s a senior officer in the marine corps. Someone I thought had integrity.

      "selftext": "Two weeks ago, I found out my (now ex) fiancé of 6 weeks had been cheating on me our ENTIRE relationship of two years. The first time (during our relationship) he slept with the other woman was three days after he asked me to be his girlfriend, and the last time he slept with the other woman (same woman) was four days before he proposed. He was loyal for three days...\n\nThe hardest part about the betrayal is that I never saw it coming. He was THE PERFECT MAN. He treated me like a queen and waited on me hand and foot throughout our entire relationship. He talked about me to everyone and bragged that I was perfect and that he was insanely lucky and blessed to have me. Unbeknownst to me, and all of our friends and family, he had a side woman the entire time that he solely used for sex. It was 100% transactional, like a drug deal (I saw the texts). No emotional connection whatsoever, so he says. The other woman said they have been meeting up for sex on and off for 10 years... When I say she was the definition of a bootycall, that's what I mean. He called/texted, she came. \n\nThere were NO signs. NO strange behavior. NO inconsistencies in his attitude towards me. NO wandering eyes. NO weird behavior when it came to his cell phone. Nothing. I would have never known if the other woman hadn't reached out and told me herself. He wouldn't have told me either. When I confronted him about it, he said he thought I was never going to find out. He said he was never going to tell me. Yes, he really said that...\n\nWhen I say this man went LENGTHS to show me he loved me. He went lengths. We went to Spain to celebrate my 30th birthday in June, but he ended up proposing on the first night of our trip. My birthday was two days later. He also surprised me by flying out my best friend so that she could be there to witness the proposal. He planned it for 6 months with the rest of my friends who were going on the trip with us. After the proposal, everyone kept telling me all of the things that went into the planning and how my ex wanted it all to be so perfect. WHY? HOW? How could he plan a proposal for 6 months with the people closest to me, only to have sex with his side piece four days before he pops the question (and 3 other times this year before that)?! I'll never understand. \n\nHow could someone who claims to love you, shows you they love you day in and day out, goes through tremendous lengths to express their love - and still cheats, in such a grimy way? He did it for so long, and so well, in such a methodical and calculated way - but came right back to me every time. He was GREAT, not good, at what he did, and that's the most terrifying part. I don't understand how he came back to me the very next day, like everything was fine. That's what haunts me. The insecurities, impulsivity, and immaturity are something completely different - also alarming, but to me, the most horrifying thing is that he could come right back to me every time (he slept with her a total of 8 times in two years), and act like it never happened. How could he tell me he loved me, could never lie to me, and make promises to protect me and my heart at all costs?\n\nI feel like I was living in a manufactured reality that wasn't real. I was/am in love with someone who never existed. I was in love with the person he wanted me to see, the man he manufactured. It's such a mindfuck. I'm falling out of love with an illusion. The shock alone has taken me OUT. I'm just trying to get through the next hour.\n\nI had one conversation with him, asking for the truth (which he didn't reveal, at first), crying like someone had died, and ending the engagement/breaking up with him. I've gone complete no contact since then, which feels right. He has tried texting me, my sister, and my best friend, and sent me a letter in the mail - all of it Ignored. There's nothing to save or reconcile. Everything I thought we were building was one-sided and built on a lie. There's nothing to save. ",

I know with time it’ll get better, I’m just annoyed that the norm is to rush into something again instead of taking time to truly heal. ",

      "selftext": "I met my ex through my elder sister. They bonded over painting. She was beyond beautiful, and seemed emotionally aware, but I never approached her because she already had a boyfriend. Secretly, I liked her.\n\nAbout a year later, I learned she had been cheated on. I didn’t want to take advantage of that, but a friend of mine texted her from my account. She replied, and I ended up carrying the conversation. We hit it off fast, talked for four or five days straight, and then she told me she was in love with me. I felt the same and told her.\n\nShe was in another state then, and within a day or two, she said she didn’t want to continue. I let her go. But she came back. And then left again. And came back. This cycle of pulling me close and then abandoning me repeated for over a year, more than 50 times.\n\nI grew attached despite the chaos. Then came the moment that still makes me sick to my stomach. She insisted I finish inside her or she would leave me. She got pregnant despite having a contraceptive. She went back to her parents, thousands of kilometres away. I travelled to be with her, made sure she had everything she needed, and asked if she wanted to keep the child. She said no.\n\nWhen I saw the ultrasound, my child, a tiny blue dot, I trembled. We both cried. That same evening, she went drinking at a friend’s wedding. I didn’t know a soul in that city, and it broke me in a way I can’t describe. The next day she took the abortion pills. I stayed, thinking maybe her mood swings and abuse were just hormones. I cried alone.\n\nShe would scream at me if I cried. She hinted at being with other men, then claimed it was just “future possibilities” and that she wasn’t sure of her desires. My only request was that if she wanted that life, she should leave me. But she wouldn’t. Somehow she convinced me she loved me, even though I could see secrecy in her eyes.\n\nShe joined a reputed science institute for her PhD. My insecurity grew. We fought a lot. I still visited her, sent her food, stayed up until midnight every night so I could talk to her after her work was done.\n\nOn a trip to the mountains, I later found out she had gone drinking with a guy at midnight without telling me. I stayed silent at first, but when I confronted her later, she exploded, insisting nothing happened.\n\nThen, one day, she confessed she had cheated on me with someone else and said she did it because I assumed she would. I wanted to die that day. She called it a mistake, begged to stay together. I asked her to cut contact with him, but she lied and kept meeting him. She even abused me for making it my fault.\n\nI created a fake account. She ended up sexting me from that account, not knowing it was me, and admitted she had cheated with that guy three times. She even fell in love with my fake profile.\n\nI cut her off. Months later, she called. I confronted her, she denied everything, claiming she had made it all up for the fake profile.\n\nMore months passed. I was still weak and still loved her. We got back together. During this time, she berated me for “ghosting” her and said I had emotionally exploited her by talking to her from the fake account,because apparently she had been in love with that fake account, having even confessed “I love you” to it.\n\nFrom August to April, I visited her five times. But by January, something shifted. Calls went unanswered. Texts were late. She claimed she was doing experiments when I knew she was pulling away.\n\nThen she confessed she had developed mutual feelings for another guy. She said she loved me but wouldn’t stop talking to him. I stayed quiet, trying to see how far things had gone.\n\nWhen I visited her later, she fell asleep and I saw her phone. All texts with him were deleted. I later logged into her Instagram and saw the truth. I miss you. Meet me for coffee. Flirty song links. She texted him first.\n\nI wanted to walk away, but she kept repeating her party and late night routine. One night, she said she was in the lab. I said I didn’t believe her. She screamed at me for not trusting her and blocked me.\n\nI took three sleeping pills that night. I survived. I blocked her.\n\nA month later, she called from another number to tell me she was now in a relationship with that guy and again, somehow, it was my fault. I blocked her again.\n\nThree months later, she called crying. Things with her new boyfriend weren’t going well. I was kind at first, until she started abusing me again. That was it.\n\nThrough all of this, the gaslighting, the emotional torture, the betrayal, I never once cheated on her. Not emotionally, not physically. I stayed loyal, even when it broke me.\n\nI used to believe in karma. Now I’m not so sure.\n\nI feel anxious all the time. I feel the withdrawal. I am on medicines. I only ever loved her, I guess, but I still don’t know why she hated me enough to destroy me for a lifetime. I don’t want to live anymore. That is what she left me with.\n",

      "selftext": "Hi guys I need advice I recently found out my partner was texting people behind my back one of them being a so claimed friend. In the beginning of our relationship I struggled to be vulnerable and open up because my last relationship ended horribly I was dating a narcissist. But he always made me feel bad about it so I eventually started opening up and letting myself get attached. When I did he did a 180 and stopped being affectionate towards me and I always felt like that was my fault because I didn’t open up in the beginning and made him feel unloved.\n\nI struggle with BPD and the whole relationship he was never willing to work on communication nor try to understand my feelings and my mental health diagnoses. That led to a lot of arguments between us some of them leading to me getting really annoyed or frustrated with him even sometimes lashing out or having an attitude. I always told him I wasn’t trying to excuse my problems and was working on them I even enrolled into therapy and started seeing a psychiatrist. But I was always fighting for him to put in effort to communicate rather than shut down and ignore how I felt because it made me feel like he didn’t care about me and like I was the only one trying to resolve any of our conflict. As well as begged him to start saying I’m sorry because he seemed to be allergic to saying it or ever taking accountability even when he did things that were clearly messed up. But he would always make an effort to tell me how I was making him depressed and that he wasn’t happy with me. I would always tell him if he wanted to leave I understood and that I know I’m hard to deal with and all I want for him is to be happy to which he would always respond “do you not want to be with me? I feel like you don’t.”\n\n3 months in I had suspicious feelings about his phone and how he was very reserved about it but I let it go till a month later I couldn’t stop thinking about it. I asked him about it and he yelled at me saying he’s not a cheater and said it was just my anxiety and that it annoys him how much I overthink. The next day I couldn’t let go how defensive he got and asked to go through his phone and found out he was hiding the fact that he texts the mother of his daughter on a day to day basis asking things like “how has your day been” and when I tried to scroll to see the rest he ripped the phone out of my hand and deleted all the messages. I never fully trusted him after that and he never tried to earn my trust back just got mad at me and would say it’s not right that I don’t trust him. Fast forward a couple months and I start getting this anxiety he’s talking to my friend (who I sorta didn’t really trust) and he said that I was too anxious and overthink too much. The other night after talking to a friend whose relationship was home wrecked by the girl I was worried about I asked to go through his phone. I found out he deleted all of their messages on signal (a work texting app) and Instagram and he also added a girl on Instagram he knew liked him after removing me as a follower. He messaged this girl all in Spanish and when I asked for him to translate he told me I can ask her myself how it’s not like that. And when I opened the texting app he ripped the phone out of my hand. I broke up with him but I can’t stop questioning if it was my fault because I would always get upset with him and made him miserable or if I overthought everything about the females and it wasn’t what I thought like he said. I really just need help finding some clarity in all of this.\n\nI apologize for the length and the terrible grammar",

He says he doesn’t want a divorce and wants to change but I don’t see any signs of it. \n\nTo those that stayed for the kids, does it ever get better? Was it worth it? Did you find peace after you left them years later?\nIf your parents stayed for the kids, how did this affect you? Were you better for it? \n\nThank in advance for sharing ",

Didn’t seriously date for about 15 years after him, but I definitely heard everyone else’s dating/marriage stories, and a lot of them involved infidelity, which only furthered my distrust of people (mostly men). Now I’m in a relatively stable relationship with a man for over a year now. We live together, and we’re mostly pretty happy. I have access to his phone, location, all that. But I can’t stop obsessing over the what ifs, and I constantly want to look at his phone/computer to see if he’s secretly talking to someone inappropriately through text or a secret app. \n\nHe’s already had secret conversations with his ex about six months in to our relationship, destroying what little trust I’d allowed myself to have thus far, but I’ve not been able to find any evidence of him actually cheating or having inappropriate contact with other women. I know most of you are going to tell me to leave simply based on his conversations with his ex, which weren’t inappropriate, and I probably should, but I didn’t and chose to forgive him and trust that he wasn’t being inappropriate, something she confirmed in an hours-long conversation where she explained their conversations and need for closure. \n\nEven so, I’m still so convinced he’s eventually going to cheat, and I don’t know if it’s intuition or trauma. How do I stop caring so much and just let myself be happy while still not being willfully blind to the signs? How do I differentiate from trauma-induced anxiety and actually sensing something is wrong? I’ve gone to therapy, studied about attachment issues, etc, but nothing has helped. The only thing that calms me down is looking through his shit and finding nothing. But apparently that’s really unhealthy for relationships. Any advice?",

      "selftext": "My D-Day was about 2 years ago now at this point. I’m 33 wife 29. And let me say, at least my anecdotal perspective, that where I thought it’d get easier.. it hasn’t. I still get the mental images and little stings of pain when I look at her sometimes. Still replay it all on repeat a lot of times while lying in bed at night. There’s sooo much that’s a trigger that idk if I’ll ever be able to fully recover unless we move somewhere else completely. Etc. \n\nBack to point though, I know as far as legally every state is a little different. Where I feel the common rule of thumb so to speak is usually like 6month-1year of separation before going for full on divorce. Long story-very short, I’ll give my example: We were pretty down financially. Wife went through a long interview process and at the end they were like, well as of now it looks like the only openings are (several states away). We discussed but ultimately there really was no choice but to take the job. Would fly back most weekends, I’d stay home and keep my job, take care of household and everything etc. \n\nAbout a month later she wrote up this separation agreement thing. Now in learning all I know now about this timeline, she had essentially already met someone. So was basically trying to cover her ass. I didn’t really agree nor disagree, but at the same knew she was all the way out there and I was here. So she was gonna do what she was gonna do regardless and nothing I can do so far away. \n\nFast forward like 2ish months later, and she loses the job. Has to come back home. Not only did I think or believe she had actually done anything (obviously I found out a lot later on) but I figured when we were both back in our marital house, living, eating, sleeping same bed together etc. That we weren’t going to be engaging in illicit affairs. But like a week after she’s back home she goes out Friday night, then isn’t back home until Monday afternoon… I was absolutely devastated to put it lightly. But it didn’t just end then. This shit went on for a couple more weeks, then sporadically dwindled down until the dude basically ghosted her and rekindled with his gf. There’s a lot more that I didn’t include, and things I didn’t know/realize while it was happening but learned later on. Also while she was in the other state for work there was basically a full on boyfriend she had. Not to mention other suspect instances I don’t have concrete proof on. \n\nSo basically, we’ve been married the whole time. Idc what she tried to say or cover her ass with. When I showed up to that house to confront her, because of her going right back to his house 2 days later after already being there all weekend. And arguing, fights etc. She watched me drive/storm off, and went back into his house and was there for a couple more days. Is something idk that I can ever forgive or get out of my head. ",

      "selftext": "\nMy bf(21m) told me a week ago (22m) that he had a secret relationship with my friend of 7 years (23m) for the span of 3months from march to may of this year. So me and this friend had not hanged out for 2 years and suddenly he started texting me that he wanted to reunite and obv i said yes so why not in december then we started texting and also my bf started texting him too i didnt read much into it since i had no problem with them being friends.\n\nIn January we finally met and i brought my bf along they hit it off really quick and was very happy that my bf had a friend i could trust (or so i thought) . Thet after that all three of us would hang out frequently until in the end of january he had come out to my bf over text, we thought he was straight up to that point and my bf told me imidiatly although he told me not to tell me bcs he would tell me himself. He invited my boyfriend to meet by himself bcs he needed to talk. My bf didnt want to go but i encorged him to bcs i thought he needed support with himself.\n\nApperantly he kissed him in the bathroom without asking my bf and when he saw how shocked my bf was he started saying it was an accident and to forget it. My boyfriend was very devestaed and told his friend but not me after some days he told me that a random boy at school kissed me him in the bathroom and that he was very sad about it but he didnt tell me it was my own friend cause he was scared of what i could do.\n\nAfter that he would still speak to him everyday and he would provoke him asking him to be friends with benefint and that he could treat jim better and that he would prove himself but my boyfriend would refuse and he would say he was testing him and that he was joking.\n\nMeanwhile i started getting inconfortable with the fact that they would speak everyday nonstop with pictures and i could not see any of the messages bcs you can open the pictures only once and told him that i dont like it he would push it aside as me being jelous and then after some times of trying to comunicate abt it started to become arguing and yelling cause i wasnt being heard. In late march we had a very bad fight about the same reason and apperantly my bofriend got mad at told jim that he agrees to be with him.\n\nThey would flirt send eachother very erotic and relationship themed videos and with me he was cold and not sexual and showed me little to no attention and love although he would vome over at my house everydayz. Late march they had their first affair. During april he went over to sleep at his house multiple times and since i was fed up with this behaviour and tired that it seemed i was the only one trying to fix things i tried braking up with him but he never let me.\n\nOne nigjt we were all hanging out and drinking and apperatly after we all left my bf went to my friends house for the 4th time that month not ti his own. And the next day he came over at mine. That night when he was sleeping i took his phone and saw a lot of things that could point to cheating but not exactly cause most things were either deleted or they spoke via pictures that i could not open after being opened.\n\nThat night i gave him the benefit of the doubt again and waitied till the morning to ask him to open his location cause i didnt belive he was hoing at his moms that morning and come back to me in a couple of hours after that he got mad at me and took my keyes and locked me in my own house. I was panivking and texting him all the time and when i could do nothing more i called my friend multiple times so if they really were together i wouldnt have left them do what they want, i could tell nothing from the phone but it was true he was there. After he came back we had too much to drink and yet even drunk he was trying to convince me that nothing was going one.\n\nAfter that night being drunk he started talking to him less and our relationship started to bloom again. I had no idea in that any of this was really happening all i had was doubt and my intuition. After a while we would still have fight abt it cause i wasnt convinced nothing was happening although my boyfriend would say so. In may it was the second semifinal of eurovison and i had secrectly opened my bf location and i was suspicious why did he not come and watch it with me and is staying home , he triend sending me pictured of him being home but i wasnt convincen when i open my location i see him at my friends house.\n\nI was panicking i didnt know what to do and told him that i would never forginve him was fighting with he tried to convince me that he was there to prepare a surprise for me for our anniversery but i wasnt having it. I called my friend too and told him that i would never forgive him and that he should be proud of himself but he was hiding it too. Meanwhile my bf was trying to fix it with me he has texted my bf “fix your own relationship i dont want part in it but if things dont work out know ill be here” after that meddage my bf never texted him again and removed him form everywhere (acording to my bf they had broken uo late april and in may they met up to talk about telling me or not that my friend was very against and my bf wantet to but he convinced him not to) after that i broke up with him but got back together one day later cause he was practically begging me and i obv still loved him.\n\nAfter that our relationshio started to bloom and feel good again but still we would fight about all these little moments cause i was not convinced until August 4th when he finally told me what will happen if tell you. I obv said nothing and he finally conffesed and told me everything. He has started therapy and sais he would do whatver it takes to make this right. I texted my friend saying i know everything and that i hated him for using me. and he was asking for forgivness and that he was just trying to have some fun and trying to pin it all on my bf which yes he is at fault but he is too.\n\nHe used me to get close to my bf he never wanted to really reunite with me. Now im devestaed im sad all the time, im scated thinking of every little detail im truing to fix it with him and actually talking to him everyday although we are currently in twi different countries untill september. I dont know what to do i dont want to break with him i love him. But i feel like my whole reality is sweept from underneath my feel how could the sweet lovly boy that only have eyes for me do all this behing my back meanwhile i was trying to fix us. I feel like dying everyday and ik scared this pit in my chest will never go away.",

      "selftext": "I'm writing this post to muster the courage and get advice to confront her.\n\nI've kept my suspicions to myself (no friends or family so as to not tarnish her image). I finally told my best friend yesterday and he is on the fence about what's going on and admits it doesn't look good. He's being neutral and supportive which I appreciate. \n\nI have asked her the occasional question about something here or there that seemed off. It would always get explained away without skipping a beat and I was made to feel like I was being overbearing or snoopy or paranoid. \n\nLike others in the sub might say about their partners, my fiancée has a lot of great qualities and has charmed all my family and friends and even my teenage kid and my ex.  I think they all genuinely love her and I believe she loves them. \n\nI also have a very good relationship with her family and care about them a lot.\n\nWe have done a lot of things together, traveled and we generally have a good rapport, similar cultural values and tastes. We are very good in the romantic and intimate department. She also helped me caregive for an elder family member for several months every day until they passed way. It was natural to her and she did 75% of the work without a demand from me. She insisted. \n\nShe has a wholesome persona and is super loving and thoughtful of people. She is a social butterfly. She goes above and beyond for those she cares about and is very nice to people even if they're not kind to her. If someone is in need she'll go out of her way to help them if it's in her power. Many good qualities. Yes. Seems too good to be true but it is indeed true. \n\nI'm very social and have a lot of friends, yet she has taught me how to be more thoughtful and understanding of people. She has even helped me improve my relationship with my family. \n\nWe did long (international) distance for a couple of years and she came to live with me and my kid for the past couple of years. \n\nI often ask her if she's happy with me, wants to be with me, loves my kid and is certain she wants to be living with me in this new country and get married. The answer is always a confident yes. \n\nWe are supposed to marry soon. \n\nBut here's the issue. \n\nBefore I met her, she had a lot of guy friends. I know the stereotype is that's a red flag, but I tried to be progressive about it and not be ruled by insecurity. Besides all of these guys are abroad from her home country or have moved elsewhere. Many are married with kids. \n\nIn general, I've seen her exaggerate in telling of stories to other people for no reason, or tell white lies of no consequence and under no duress, but it's still a distortion of the truth. I'm all about the truth even if it's painful .. but I try not to force it on others unless it's consequential. She is defensive on any criticism minor or major. I could never understand why. I've attributed it to the fact that she had a very overbearing and abusive father and she always had to explain herself. \n\nShe is addicted to her phone and carries it everywhere. I mean everywhere. She rarely leaves it anywhere alone. She sleeps with it nearby her, which I can't stand. She says it helps her anxiety over her elderly mother abroad who could call anytime with an emergency. We've talked about the phone addiction over several months. She said she's willing to work on it. She made it clear at the beginning that she preferred her phone privacy. I have tried to be progressive and not be ruled by insecurity. \n\nShe has a \"girl\" friend from \"back home\" that I've never talked to. I know she's a real person. I've seen her photos and she's shown me her IG. \n\nBut this friend calls a lot and only wants to message on a non-standard app that has its own passcode. This friend calls her everyday and immediately hangs up (a missed call or several missed calls) which I've deduced is to get her attention to go look in the app. \n\nI asked about it and her friend wants to use that app because \"she doesn't trust other apps\".\n\nShe receives a missed call on WhatsApp and then they are on this other messaging app. \n\nIn general, if I casually come up to her while she's on the phone, she immediately closes whatever app she was on. \n\nShe left her phone on the dresser one day. It wasn't locked. I looked up the friend in her contacts and it's actually showing up as a guy's name on the profile in WhatsApp, even though the manual phone contact name is her \"girl\" friend's name. He 100% doesn't live in her home country. He lives in another country where she has family and visited several years ago before we met, but I imagine he could have easily visited her home country while her and I were doing LDR. He is married with a wife and kids and definitely not related to her. \n\nI also saw on her hidden folder of her photos app some super thirsty nude selfies recently shot while she is living with me. She used to send me such photos when we were doing LDR. I haven't seen these photos before. \n\nI waited an agonizing week later and asked if she knew anyone from that country other than her family because I had some business to do there and she said no. I said are you sure there isn't anyone? She said no. \n\nI'm suspicious something is up. I'm also suspicious that he isn't the only one. I won't go into all the details but I'm confident that lines are approached or crossed. \n\nUnsure if I'm prepared to see what is likely in the conversation in that app. Probably all the worst things imaginable.\n\nNow I'm imagining my whole world imploding, devastating my child with another failed relationship, all of our family hurt and also my friends and wider community shocked. \n\nMy impulse is to ask her nicely about her \"girl\" friend and why I haven't talked to her yet. To ask why she needs to talk on a separate passcoded app. Then to insist to see the conversation. \n\nThe answer will be telling. \n\nI'm expecting DARVO. \n\nAm I going about this the right way?\n\nI'm still in shock. She been perfect in 85% of all other aspects of life. I feel the biggest knot in my stomach and haven't been able to eat or sleep more than an hour a day for over a week. I thought I had successfully started a new life and spent so much time and resources to make sure everyone got along. Even my ex!\n\nI've never felt so low. \n\nWhat would make someone do this? Is it the thrill? Is it sport? Is it an addiction? \n\nShe has asked me many times when we will get married, but now there's this giant rock slide blocking the way. \n\nHow do I reconcile this with everything that's good about her? She has genuinely made all of the rest of my life better, but yet this betrayal strikes the foundation.\n\n\n\n",

      "selftext": "Throwaway account. \n\nI am feeling so lost and confused. My(30M) wife(27F) and I have been together for about 8 years and married for a little under 3 years (no kids). Yesterday while we were talking about something, she confessed to me that she had sex with a co-worker. For some context, we have been recently dealing with some unrelated family issues that have left us really hurting, so we haven’t been the best with each other.\n\nFast forward to one night we got into an argument before she had to leave for a work trip (legit and confirmed). We left things pretty up in the air, but we said it was just a bad fight, that we love each other very much, and that we’ll pick things up when she returns. Night arrives a few days later and she gives me the airplane detailed so I can track her and whatnot, but when she finally landed, she said she had to make q quick stop to celebrate with her co-workers a huge victory they had just gotten. Keep in mind this was at 1am right after her flight had landed on a Sunday night. I didn’t see her that night since she told me to go to sleep and not wait up for her. And yesterday, she told me that’s when the affair had happened (sex). She confessed saying how embarrassed and ashamed she was that she had destroyed our 8 years together for just one night of release. \n\nI was completely shattered as I’ve told my wife in the past that one of my biggest fears in life is being cheated on (I suffer from GADs, and have always dealt with PTSD and intense nightmares of my biggest fears) so she was well aware of the severity. However, she claims that it meant nothing and after I gave her an ultimatum (cut contact with this person, leave your job, and turn in your location settings), she agreed with no hesitation. I was still so angry that I broke down and started sobbing, and she said that I had every right to be sad, angry, and distrustful. She also started breaking down and sobbing with me, and although my wife and I have had a strong and close bond with each other for the past 7 years or so, I still feel so incredibly hurt. All I can picture now when I see her is her ****ing this dude (thankfully idk what he looks like) and I start to feel nauseous. \nI (regrettably) asked her for details around who this person is, when she started to develop interest for this person, and she swears it was only early this year, and that so far it was first a kiss at a party, and then sex the night she came late from the airport. She says they bonded over the work they were doing. \n\nNow, I sit here in the dark, unable to fall asleep and unsure of what to do next. After she agreed to the conditions I gave her, I told her that I only wanted to hear her agree to them before I even consider what my decision will be. I told her that I’d have a decision by tomorrow on whether I want to file for divorce or not, but I still have no idea what to do or how to best handle this. So now I Kindly ask for any advice that you may have for me. Thank you for taking the time to read this, and thank you for those who respond. \n\nPS, apologies for the bad grammar/structure - it’s late at night and I can’t fall asleep. ",

      "selftext": "My husband cheated on me after I left the house with our two kids. He is not a good man. To say the least I found that a woman he did pool work for who was a stripper/escort he met 11 days after I left. Not even two weeks and he met her. Come to find out they had sex multiple times and he had this excuse “well you left”. I know this is all bullshit but he came up with, “I am okay if you cheat on me to make it even. I wouldn’t have done it if I didn’t think you were gone forever.” Well, now it’s “well it’s different with men. Men can wash their dicks, women can’t just wash off. Obviously again this is stupid and he sounds actually uneducated. I don’t understand how someone lives with these constant excuses then forms of “making it right” by saying I can cheat, then retracting the offer. Obviously I never would I have morals that would eat me alive if I did. I left because of his treatment, I wouldn’t have left if he didn’t drive me away. Somehow everything comes back on me as if I was partying while I was gone. No, I was taking care of my kids and crying. Can I get a man’s thoughts on this? I don’t understand this absolute seemingly ridiculous response to my disappointment and trauma. ",

Typical tragic affair where the AP clearly didn't care for her and she got nothing from it except a sense of rejection from AP and a ton of pain and hurt in our relationship, which would have been better spent raising the issues in our relationship before the affair happened, and working on them.\n\nI've told no one about it and my family don't know. It's such a lonely existence as a result. I'm close to my family incl my parents and as I struggle with flashbacks, hurt, self esteem and trust issues post D Day, they can see that playing out without any context as to why.\n\nInterested in your stories on this front? On the one hand, my family would be a great support for us and for me, but there is a huge risk that they will take my side, write my wife off and make the issue worse. There is also a risk anyway that they find out over time as we are all connected to AP and AP's family (APs family also known as it was his wife who came to me.to tell me, yeah sure was a tough conversation).\n\nHave have you managed it?",

We lost our first at 21 weeks, got to hold him and say goodbye.\n\nThe day after Father’s Day I found out he was having an affair with one of our “friends”. They had been talking/sexting for weeks or even a month. This “friend” was living with our neighbours \nOn Father’s Day he went golfing with our neighbours. Than went back to their house and not come home until after 10:30 that night and than snuck back up after everyone had gone to bed and for an hour. The day earlier had also snug up and stayed for 20 mins. I found this all out after when I looked through our cameras and our neighbours camera. He says they only kissed on Father’s Day but I’m not sure if I’ll ever believe that. \n\nThis girl livid with our neighbours for 3 months and was planning this the whole time. She is also married, had two kids and is pregnant with her third. Back in April she mad a comment on how she didn’t get why me and my ex were together as we were politically opposite(not true). She told my ex in May that all the girls in our group had an inside joke that they all wanted to marry him expect me (we aren’t married, we both don’t want to waste money on a wedding). She would ask me almost daily how our relationship was going and basically give me pointers on how to leave. Than would take anything I said to her and twist it and tell him I didn’t love him anymore. On Father’s Day I told her I was super low and didn’t want to be here anymore and she literally didn’t say anything. She wanted to take my life and my kids. She pushed so hard for our kids to be friends \n\nSince this has all blown up after Father’s Day. We went the first week without really talking other than about the kids. Than I stupidly begged for him to try and work things out, even though up until than he was showing no remorse for what he did. Even was still planning on seeing her again, until her husband made her block him. He agreed to try couples counseling. He found us a counsellor and we have been going since. He’s showing remorse for what he had done, however I don’t if it’s to late. Will I ever be able to trust him again. He allowed this other woman to manipulate him and not once tried to talk to me about what she was saying was true or not. \n",

      "selftext": "tw: depression, suicidal ideation\n\nI have been with my husband for 6 years, married for 3. He has depression. At the time I married him, while he was still struggling with his purpose in life, he was working full time and seemed to be improving mentally.\n\nThis year, his mental health struggles came back. Every time he was supposed to work, he would get a debilitating stomachache which caused him to gradually stop going and eventually quit. Around this time, he picked up streaming as a hobby. He would ask me to go out on the weekends, but due to my concerns over our funds, I opted to stay at home. I don’t know why I didn’t even as much as go to the park with him.\n\nSo he fell very deep into streaming. He was streaming every day, late into the night and even into the early hours of the morning. I asked him to stop streaming so late and he obliged, though not without an argument.\n\nWell, this is the problem. One of his viewers (often his only viewer) was a young woman who was in love with him. She would stay up every night watching him, join the stream the instant it started, and send comments nonstop every day. Of course this made me uncomfortable, but he insisted it was nothing for me to worry about.\n\nAbout that..\n\nShe wanted to know about his streams before they start, so she started privately messaging him on Twitter. At first, it was only about the streams, but over time, they started to chat. She said she loved him, and he replied the same.\n\nOf course, I found out. He wasn’t exactly good at hiding it. When I called him out he vehemently denied that he has any real feelings for her, and that he only said it because “he felt like she wanted him to say it”. You may call it copium, but this part does line up with my husband’s behavior. Due to past abuse, he is nearly incapable of making decisions on his own. He is often a people pleaser.\n\nBut still. I’m devastated. We got into a huge fight. He blocked her and quit streaming. We talked about getting divorced, he said he doesn’t love me anymore, and mostly he talked about wanting to take his own life. He said that no matter what his depression is not getting any better. He doesn’t feel happiness from anything. He thinks dying would be the best thing he could do.\n\nHe doesn’t have a support network. He has no friends and he does not have a good relationship with his family. He tried therapy in the past, but it essentially boiled down to him detailing his trauma and them replying with “That’s tough” so now he’s averse to it. He’s tried various medications to no real result. Now, not only do I have to try to manage the weight of his cheating, but I also have to try to stabilize him. Even though he did something terrible, I don’t want him to die. This is not just a fight —> threatening suicide situation, as he has seriously attempted in the past long ago.\n\nEven though he’s hurt me so badly, I still love him. \n\nAs a cherry on top, we live in a foreign country and my visa is dependent on our marriage. \n\nI feel like both of our lives are crumbling before our eyes. Why did he have to do it? Why couldn’t he have kept a distance between them?\n\nI’m sorry if this is the wrong subreddit. I feel so desperate right now and really need help. Thank you for reading.",

I questioned her about it but she said it was just that.\n\nFast forward to about 6 years ago and it had been on and off my mind over the years, I questioned her again, there were subtle hints that something more had happened. But again she said nothing further happened. \n\nI don't remember how but I asked again 4 weeks ago and she went silent, after I said that her silence was not comforting. I asked wether she slept with him and she nodded. My world fell apart. We toom a walk to the shop and asked her if there was anything else she wanted to \"confess\" to whilst we were having this conversation. It turns out there was another guy that she had slept with and various other activities with 5/6 other people.\n\nWe spent the next day apart whilst I was processing, the day after we had a conversation about it. I expressed how important honesty was and that I would need to know everything, to help me process and not overtime about who she was with etc. Information was trickled over the next three days - turns out she had been with each of them twice on separate occasions and that this was mostly in the last 6/7 months of uni.\n\nBeen struggling to process this over the past 4 weeks, good days and bad days. We have been intimate on several occasions which has been good.\nBut on Monday after I said that she needed to be completely  transparent instead of waiting for me to ask the right questions she divulged that one of the guys she gave a blowjob to was at the start of uni - 16 years ago. \n\nI feel like I have been living a lie for 80% of our relationship, even though she said she decided to change and become a better person 13 years ago after the last incident. \n\nI'm really struggling to trust her, we were building a life together and I was really happy with our lives.

      "title": "Blindsided by serial cheater - Looking for direction",
      "selftext": "Hi All,\n\nThis is going to be a lot, so really just want to kind of dump here and hope for some guidance, direction, support, or advice. It's been about 5 months since I found out that my now ex-girlfriend cheated on me with at least 5 men, but I believe it was a lot more over the course of our 10 year relationship. We got together in senior year of high school and have lived together for about 7 years in a few different apartments. She was my first real everything and she had a few highschool relationships prior to me. Our relationship was not perfect, but I thought we had a great understanding of where we stood as we navigated our 20's, different career paths, and life in general. She was also, by all accounts, an amazing girlfriend: cooked, cleaned, supportive, loving, hardworking. I come from a very challenging, divorce-ridden family home that required we moved around a lot until high school and she comes from a nuclear household in our area. We both had our own mental health struggles over the years, but I never imagined that hers was this bad.\n\nAbout 6 months ago, I found out that she had a one-night-stand with her best friend's cousin while on a trip that I did not go on about 7 months prior to that. This crushed me, but I was willing to try and reconcile as she was my everything and the thought of losing her, her family, and our shared life sent me into vomit induced anxiety attacks. She had discussed opening the relationship over the years and I assumed that since we got together so young that we would eventually explore those options with boundaries. Looking back, each time she mentioned opening the relationship over the years, it was very likely an admission of guilt to having already slept with others.\n\nDuring that month of false reconciliation, I was given access to her electronics and socials, we talked extensively of the why/how's, and she swore on the lives of her family that this was the only instance of cheating over our relationship. About one month after I find out about the ONS, I discover a number of photos being sent to unsaved numbers on her laptop and immediately confronted her. After an explosive episode, she admits to cheating with at least 4 other people, mostly bosses at her various culinary jobs. I made the very damaging mistake of asking WAY too many questions and found out that they slept together in our house, previous apartment, other locations, and much more disgusting detail than I care to share (positions, protection, etc.).\n\nHard to say when it all started, but if I had to guess, likely 5+ years of having at least one other partner. One of these individuals is a man in his 60's, married, and whom I've given awards to for allowing us to host a party in an event space he owns. I've met his wife, attended his parties, and would frequently drive my ex to her places of work. Another one of these individuals even attended her families Christmas party one year as they have an open door policy for all friends and coworkers. She struggled with her own mental health, career, and friends, so I was always supportive of her coworkers and assumed that they helped her with a sense of belonging. They were so interwoven in our life and in my face that I never, in a million years would've assumed this was possible. We shared everything with each other about our work so I've met, shaken hands, and got close with many of these people involved. Looking back, there are a number of glaring red flags that I missed, but overlooked in the pursuit of safety, stability, and comfort.\n\nI should add that we both drank pretty frequently, but myself more than her. Our families were both heavy drinkers, we drank every weekend/socially, and I drank, mostly beer, pretty much every day after work. I recognize now that I was using this to mask quite a bit of anxiety and depression.\n\nI was in a state of shock for about a month or two, but immediately kicked her out, got all of the bills and utilities in my name, blocked her family, friends, and the AP's numbers and on social media, got tested for STD/I's, got into therapy, informed my friends and family, threw away anything that reminded me of her, deleted thousands of photos, stopped drinking, and increased my anxiety medication. The following few months were brutal and I tried to stay as busy as humanely possible, seeing friends or family at every opportunity and saying yes to everything.\n\nOver the last few months, I've been really struggling with my mental health and finally decided to leave our shared house (which was too expensive to afford on my own) and moved in with my married friends as to not be alone. I'm still in the process of moving my stuff to storage, donating furniture, and going through the move logistics, but have been out of the house for a few weeks. I make enough money to live on my own, but the idea of living alone right now makes me panic as I don't feel I'm in a strong enough place mentally. My family (parents, grandparents, etc.) are either divorcing, don't have room, or would set me back mentally too much to live with right now. I'm also realizing how heavily I relied on my ex and her family (who I've known since I was 17) as an escape from my own broken and unstable home life. I was incredibly close with all of her family, especially her parents, who I would see more than my own through weekly dinners, hanging out on the weekends, texting, and going to events together. Losing them has been just as hard in many ways as losing my partner.\n\nWhile I'm having somewhat better days, the overwhelming sense of darkness and loneliness is really starting to eat at me. I've tried dating here and there, slept with one other person, spending time with friends & family, engaging more at work, trying new hobbies, prayer, meditation, therapy (CBT, talk, and EMDR), medication, and occasional working out, but nothing seems to be helping to take away the pain. I don't know if it's because of my drinking or emotional avoidance, but I did not know it was possible to feel this constant level of pure despair and I'd be lying if I didn't say that I've had daily suicidal ideation for the last few months. I've cried more in the last few months than I have in my entire life and occasional anxiety/panic attacks and pretty constant intrusive thoughts/nightmares.\n\nI'm fighting like hell, but could really use any suggestions, tips, tricks, or really anything to help make this subside. I've shared my struggles with close friends and some family, but I'm really struggling to see any light at the end of this tunnel. The last few weeks, I've also found myself unblocking accounts and fighting the urge to reach out to my ex again. I know, logically, how stupid that is, but she was my only sense of safety and stability, so to have the rug swept out from under me has left me feeling more directionless and stranded than I could've ever imagined.\n\nA few points I should add: inpatient mental health is not really a viable options due to my living situation and not having the appropriate support. I have no intention of telling the man's wife or my ex's family (they know she cheated, but not the extent). I've only seen my ex in person once about 3 months ago and recently broke no contact via a phone call earlier this week.",

This is followed by a ton of sleepless, lonely nights, feeling like the life you thought you had with someone has been ripped away from you.

      "selftext": "I am 29 years old, and I've been with my girlfriend for 6 years. We were fiancee, trying to buy house together and planning a child together. We are living together for last 6 years, and we were really fusional. She always told me I was the love of her life, and I believed her with all my soul, as I thought she was the love of my life too. I work hard (around 55 hours per week), and she work hard too. As her job had staggered schedule week end and night, I regularly helped her for dozen hours a week to spend time with her and to be supportive. \n\nAt home, I was doing a majority of housework. I always gave her shitload of love as she was like my prized possession. \n\nI had so much attention for her, as money is not a problem at all for me, and I wanted her to be the most happy women of all times. She always said to me that she doesn't deserve me as I was such the best boyfriend anyone want to have, and that she was so happy and grateful. \n\n\n\nI always dreamed to make a family, and we were planning to have a child next year. One week ago, we discovered that she was pregnant. I was so happy. We spent two days trying to find a name with full happiness. \n\nThe third day, she announced me that it is maybe not my child, as she was cheating with me for the last 6 months with some trash guy who harassed her at her job frequently.  My world collapsed. I wanted to leave her as soon as I learned the new, but we had to leave together for the week as it was her appartement too. \n\nDuring the next days, we spoke a lot about it. She told me that the story with the other ass**** was finished since 2 weeks. She told me that the day of her birthday, while I was cooking a huge dinner for her and preparing a lot of stuff for her to be happy (I took 2 days of holidays just for that, she had 200 euros of oyster, i spend two days doing selfmade gyozas as it was her favorite food, a boat promenade, ....), she went for 3 hours at his home to kiss, fuck and share her birthday with him. \n\nShe spent the whole week saying to me that she loves me and will forever, and that I am the love of her life, and that she will wait for me all her life. Keeping hearing that, I began to regain some hope and I began to think I wanted to come back with her in few years after a huge breakup to allow each of us to make up with our lifes. \n\n5 days after I learned the cheating, the day of the abortion of the child, her parents arrived at my home early in the morning and began to take all the furnitures and her business to relocate her at a new appartement. I wasn't aware of that and it was a huge shock. I had to spend all the day telling them what is my furniture and what is her, dealing at the same time with the new that she was suddently leaving, and with the abortion that wad happening in the room. \n\nI still helped everyone, while comforting my fiancee during the abortion, giving her hugs and love and making her hot water bag hot every 5 minutes to appease her pain. I even went to buy some bear for her family because they had hardwork. \n\n\nThe evening, we went both of us to have walk in the city for one hour. She hold my hand and she promised me the star. \n\nThe following day, she told me in the morning that I was a octopus grabing her leg, and that I had to let her go away. I was so confused. Few hours later, she told me that she still love me and she still think I am the love of her live, but that we had only 50% chance to be together in the future, and that she need space. I was even more confused. We finished the relocation the same day, and then she left the home to her new place after the lunch definetly. I was angry and I wanted to leave her forever. \n\n\nThe same day, at night, she sent to me that she will love me forever and that i will always be the love of her life. \n\nThe next day (around a week after the new of her cheating), she was supposed to help me after work to clean the mess her family made with relocating. I called her in the morning to be sure she will be here, and she agreed, and she told again that we have all the chance to be together one day because she loves me. But she never came to my house to help and didn't answered any of my calls for the day. I cleaned alone. \n\nTwo days later, today she told me that she doesn't want to see me again, and that she doesn't love me anymore. She told me that we won't ever be again together and that I had to go away. Of course, with all the bullshit she told me during the week and as I am a artichoke heart, I began to have faith that I would forgive her cheating because I love her and because she loves me, so my heart got broken again.\n\n\nAnd here I am. All my paradise and the future i built with my hands for last 6 years destroyed in one week, back to dust, with nothing to clutch onto. I have a huge operation in 2 weeks, that is planned for the last 4 months, nobody to help me to go to the hospital that day. \n\nI am constently in fear since the beginning of that shitty week. I can't even sleep at night, as I wake up unable to breathe by fear. My hands shake all day long. I don't even have a friend in the region as I spent all last 6 years fully onto my relationship, neglecting my social part. Yesterday, I learned the same day that one of my bestfriend had a huge ill problem few months ago, and that he can die at any time. I learned too that my grandma was at the hospital. \n\nI think these last days will be the worst days of my whole life.",

It’s been wonderful but bittersweet and I know the hysterical bonding phase won’t last, and honestly, might not be good for my emotional health.\n\nI find myself restless and getting so fucking angry, disappointed, and sad that she put me in this awful, impossible position of her wanting to reconcile and forgive her for stepping out on our marriage.\n\nI am not eating or sleeping normal, my work has suffered, and I find myself getting emotional in the middle of doing something mundane and seemingly out of nowhere.\n\nI saved the text messages I found on her phone and relive the night that I saw undeniable proof of her infidelity. I want to leave her, but in doing so will disrupt our family, hard work, and wealth we built together.\n\nI think about our three young boys and how I won’t get to tuck them in bed every night or feed them breakfast every morning, or wake up and hug them as much. I’m going to miss them asking me to play with them all of the time and the unsolicited “I love you daddy” and random cuddles I get from at least one of them on a daily basis. All because I have to make this unfair and unconscionable decision of forgiving or not forgiving a cheating spouse. I even think my three year old is picking up on something, as he has asked me recently “Are you happy daddy?” - up until a week ago, my answer would have been “of course I am!” But now I hesitate, and say “yes I am happy because of you and your brothers”, but not a simple answer I think he would have expected.\n\nThe tears happen at least once a day, usually in the morning when I’m getting ready for the day or late at night when the house is quieter. \nI want to forgive my wife, my life would be “easier” and more secure, but I don’t know if I could live with myself staying with this shadow of a person I fell in love with, knowing what she did and is capable of doing again. She is now an entitled abuser that quit on our marriage and put our family at risk. The woman I married would never have done this. At least she feels shamed and embarrassed and realizes the gravity of the situation.\n\nI want to forgive, but I keep thinking if I was on the outside looking in and that same person asked me what they should do, I would say drop her ass and keep your dignity and sanity, and that you are still desirable and worthy of true happiness and faithfulness. It’s just so fucking hard letting go even though this has been the worst week of my life, I still love her and  but I feel like a chump at the same time and don’t know if I can push past this to forgive her.\n\nThanks for letting me rant. Hopefully I can get some sleep.",

      "selftext": "One year ago I found out my long term partner had been cheating on me with nearly 40 people while bragging about it to his best friend. We broke up, but continued to stay in contact because I’m an idiot. Low and behold we got close again. He would tell me he was still in love with me and wanted to be my husband again (this went on for half a year). But one day he suddenly flipped the script and found a friends with benefits... I flipped out and he assured me it was just sex and that he loved me… \n\nWell, a month later he tells me he has fallen in love with her and they run off to be in a poly relationship. \n\nYeah… how stupid do I look right now? I totally let myself be used because I was convinced he was someone he wasn’t. Seeing “their” dating profile was devastating as it was sickening.\n\nWell guess what? It’s been three weeks since they’ve entered their relationship and he’s already cheating on her. I came across another account on the app he used to cheat on me with. It’s his and only his (on pure if anyone is curious). He’s such mega cheater that he’s found a way to cheat while being poly. WHAT THE FUCK.\n\nHe explained to me once that he has a cheating fetish. But I think that term softens what exactly he’s doing. I think he has a desire to do genuine evil onto others. Because if this was a sex addiction, he has the opportunity  to do that out in the open with his partner now. If it was just a kink for doing things in secrecy, then he’d do things in secrecy with the consent of his partner. It’s like this cheating kink requires a human sacrifice.\n\nOkay, that sounds harsh but hear me out. I mean to say that it’s exciting to him BECAUSE he risks hurting someone. It’s like he’s like gambling with someone’s love… with someone’s most vulnerable self. Not to sound dramatic, but it’s like playing with someone’s soul.\n\n\nAnyhow. \n\nYeah.\n\nThe devil is real and he lives on Earth.\n\n",
