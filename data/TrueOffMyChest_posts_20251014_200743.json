      "selftext": "I met this girl at work. She was really attractive, but I heard she was in a relationship, so I kept my distance. Months later, we worked some closing shifts together, and started talking. We eventually discussed relationships, and she told me how she wants to be with her boyfriend forever, move out and marry him. Apparently he lives 10 hours away. She also mentioned how her faith was important to her, and he's also religious.\n\nSo, one day as I came into work, she suddenly asked for my number and reached out to me later that evening, and from there we just started talking about work, hobbies, music and whatnot. I went along with it, and I treated it as a light friendship at first. We were texting on and off for a solid month. I discovered we had lots in common, and, well, I ended up catching feelings. Shortly on, she stopped texting me completely, and then at work told me it was because her boyfriend didn't want her talking to other guys, which I respected. Nowadays, however, she gives me the cold shoulder in person and doesn't seem interested in speaking to me anymore, like turned away, zero eye contact, etc. It's a clear contrast to how she used to be; friendly, a bit flirty, always saying hi.\n\nAnyway, it's left me feeling confused as to why she even reached out to me in the first place, if she knew her boyfriend wouldn't approve of her talking to other guys? I don't know, but it's been tough letting go of these feelings even though none of it is tangible or realistic. Anyone else been in a situation like this?",

I even did a ride-along with one of their technicians. The local manager told me she liked me and was eager to bring me on. Then I received a pre-adverse action letter due to old charges from years ago.\n\nThe first charge was in 2014. It was labeled “burglary,” but it wasn’t what it sounds like. It involved my grandfather’s house. After he passed, my aunt and uncle accused me of taking materials I shouldn’t have. The second charge came from a different incident where a BB accidentally broke a window. I was charged with malicious destruction of property, but I paid for the damage, and it has been resolved since 2018.\n\nI’ve worked hard to rebuild my life since then. I’ve stayed out of trouble, held steady jobs, and done everything possible to improve. I sent HR a full explanation, took responsibility, and included references who can speak to the person I am now.\n\nI am trying to start over in the right way. I want a good, stable job where I can build a career. I honestly thought this would be the place. The way everything aligned felt like fate; it seemed meant to be the fresh start I’ve been hoping for.\n\nNow I’m waiting, checking my email too often, hoping they’ll still give me a chance. It’s difficult not to feel discouraged when you’ve worked so hard to move forward and your past keeps coming back to hold you back.\n\nIf anyone has received a pre-adverse letter but still got hired, please share your story. I could really use some hope right now.",

I already go through hell with her living in our basement, and now I have to deal with her going to my school.\n\nAs a kid, school was always my safe place away from her. It was a place I didn't have to walk on eggshells and feel safe. Now everything has went through the window. I'm terrified she's going to yell and verbally attack me while at school or on the bus. I don't have any evidence to get a protection order, so the University can't do anything, so now I have to deal with her waiting at the bus stop for her bus when I get off my bus to get to class. I have to deal with her having a class near to my class and deal with the possiblity of seeing her when I go to the lab room, and worry if her class will get get off early and we will be forced to walk in the same hallway. I can get a security guard to walk me to my classroom, but that won't stop her from yelling at me or something. I'm even scared to have a security guard walk me because she knows they're there because of her and is probably furious about that.\n\nI can't transfer because I can't afford to move even to the next town over, and she wouldn't transfer to the college. Even if I did have the money, I doubt my school could make that work with my praciticum next semester. I seriously wish I could drop-out, even though I am so close to get my bachelor's, which I have been working towards since before I even graduated highschool. All of my life I have been fighting against what she makes me feel, but I'm so done. I just want to give up. I wish I could just take all of my pills, but I don't have enough that will really do anything.\n\nI just talked to my dad about feeling so done, but he just wants me to learn coping skills, but I constantly feel in danger. Besides, when I see her, I go into panic mode. I can't comprehend doing breathing techniques when someone who tried to kill me is a few feet away from me. I want her gone from my school, but unless she does something stupid, that won't happen.\n\nShe's the one who made my life hell, but I'm the one who just live with the consequences.",

      "selftext": "\nI (21F) was seeing a guy (20M) from my university for a while and we were exclusive. It wasn’t just a fucking around and that’s it. It was a mutual relationship. We both had great communication with what we wanted until the end. It was “girl likes boy and boy likes girl” (in a good way) thing that was going great. He ended things mid september, saying he was dealing with a lot family problems and academic pressure. He told me he had thought about it the weekend before, even though earlier that same week he was still saying he wanted to make time for me and seemed completely into it (Actually being sincere) After he ended it, the next week still being emotional, I told him I missed him and thought we could see how to make something work. He said he appreciated me being sincere but stood by his decision. I asked if everything between us was just for fun, but he never answered. (Which IK i shouldn’t have but I was emotional and impulsive) Since then we started playing the “who cares less” game. But we see each other around campus constantly, and it’s like he’s still aware of me all the time. He watches my Instagram stories within minutes, walks near where I usually sit, and it feels like he’s keeping tabs from a distance. The day before his birthday, I noticed he went back into our old iMessage thread and watched a TikTok I had sent him over a month ago. Then, on his actual birthday, I texted him “happy birthday” to be mature about it, and he replied in under two minutes thankful that i texted him.\n\nAnd then yesterday… I walked past him while I was with my friend. He was with his friends talking. He looked at me, then quickly looked away not in a rude way, just nervous. Later, while I was sitting at my usual table with my friends, he walked by alone. He didn’t say hi to me, didn’t look angry, just walked past like he didn’t know how to act. What’s confusing is that he still greets my friends every time he sees them just not me. Like, he’ll go out of his way to say hi to them, even when I’m right there. It’s been a little over three weeks since he ended things. I’ve been journaling, focusing on school, going to therapy, going to my psychiatrist, hanging out with friends basically doing all the “move-on” healthy things but I still think about him constantly. I really miss him.\n\nI believe him when he said he had family issues and was stressed with school people have seen him just studying on campus all the time. But I can’t tell if he still cares or if I’m just holding onto false hope. I know that if he wanted to be with me he knows how to reach for me so all of this “signals” or whatever they’re mean nothing. But it’s driving me insane. ",

      "selftext": "I (15) have been utterly hated by people since I was about 8. Now I know the average person who's an adult may look at this and think it's an over exaggeration I suppose. But it really isn't. In my life people have attacked me over and over - Metal spiked boots, stones, pieces of bricks, over a hundred people came to watch the time a group of people planned and attempted to kill me for a shitty shock video - fuck you name it. I've been lucky I haven't been stabbed or shot. People have also reminded me in other ways about their hatred for me. Verbally telling me what they think really. I've had to be locked in rooms multiple times in my life for my own safety because of people trying to hurt me.\n\nMy parents don't particularly like me either. They say they love me - and they do, in the way you love your child. But they don't like me for who I am. Enjoy being in my presence or talking to me. If that makes sense. I don't have any other family. I have a younger sister but she also very obviously hates me and makes it clear. She tells me what she thinks constantly whether that's through words or violence. \n\nA big majority of the friends I've had haven't had very good intentions with me either. I never picked up on their behaviors I guess because I'm autistic and far enough on the spectrum that I'm not high functioning. The only time I've ever felt romantic love for someone was another friend who I later realized had horrible intentions with me. It's soured my experience with love a bit because those feelings were partially made from being love bombed but that's a whole other thing I guess. Without sounding like some incel I don't think I will find love in my life. Ever. And it's not that I don't want it - I do, and it's embarrassing but I often lay awake at night and think of someone seeing me. Really seeing me. In a way I don't think anyone has before. I really want to love someone and for someone to love me but so many people hate me that I don't think I'll get that. \n\nI have a few friends and one best friend. I hold my best friend very dear and she matters a lot to me. A lot dearer than I think I can explain. I'm not good at socializing.\n\n I have agoraphobia because of people's dislike for me and I leave the house four times a month for a few hours at max. Some months I don't even leave the house at all. I have online school because of my physical and mental problems so I stay in the house. I can't hold conversations too well a lot of the time and I really struggle to hold friendships. I sometimes wonder if that's why people hate me. \n\nI just wish people would treat me nicely really and people would see me for who I am (and that's not an invite for people to reach out to me without knowing what I'm like or anything. You'll just scare me in honesty. I'm sorry, I'm here to get this off my chest). I wish people would like me how I try to like people. I'm not a nasty person or anything - anyone who's been around me and not gone in for the attack would tell you I'm not a vicious or bad intended person. A lot of people who have been around me say I'm a very funny person actually. I just wish people would make me happy like I try make them. I don't know. I guess I'm lonely and tired of being beaten down. I want to be cared about instead of hit and verbally abused",

I was asking her for advice and finally let out something that I’ve realized about this situation. The only reason I’m still talking to this guy is because I’m scared no one will ever be interested in me again (in the romantic area) the way he is. When I said this she didn’t reply, she just laughed a bit. This on top of the fact that she told me I was behind on others my age (once again in the love department) has had me thinking. All of my friends have boyfriends (long term) and have at least had their first kiss. I think I’m just really self conscious or something I don’t know. Now that I’m in university it’s been hitting me that I never had a boyfriend or anything like that. And I’m partly to blame myself. I’m not the prettiest and I’ve only recently started becoming socially active. But I’m not the kind of girl boys are interested in. Do I take my shot with this guy, hope feelings develop just so I can have my first kiss and so on; this way I’ll at least have had those. But I don’t know…",

In my class I have a small group of 4 or 5 friends whit whom I fell most connected, whit whom I go out, study, laugh, in short… those I consider the closest to me. In general, I get along with all the other girls in my class, but I’ve always had a closer relationship with them. Yet, for more than a year I have known that there is a group where there are all my classmates with whom I have a relationship and there are also my closest friends. \nI found out by chance one morning last year. There was a school assembly, so we would go out earlier, and in front of me they started talking about their plans to go all together to have breakfast. \n\nI was there, listening, and slowly a very bad feeling in my stomach came down.\nThey realized that they were talking about it in front of me, and my \"closest\" friends - the ones I thought really knew me,asked me on the fly if I wanted to go too, maybe meeting half an hour before.\n\nBut at that point I didn't make it. I felt put in the way only because they realized the fool. I refused with an excuse, but inside I felt humiliated.\nNothing has changed since then. They continue to organize themselves and talk about the group, they mention it all the time even when I'm present. And every time they agree on something, then only later one of them text to me in private to ask me if I want to join. And I never know what to answer, because in part I want to go, but in part I feel that I don’t want to be the “ addition later”, the one invited out of pity or not to make it  weight. \n Over time I almost got used to it, or so I tell myself. But every time it happens, that same wound reopens inside me. I feel excluded, marginal, as if I were only half part of the group. Even if I get along with them in general, even if we go out together and laugh, there is always that feeling of distance that I can't ignore. I don't know if I'm exaggerating or if I'm too sensitive, but it hurts to know that the people you really care about don't consider you as part of their circle. And the most frustrating thing is that I can't talk about it with any of them, because I know they would say that there is no malice, that \"they didn't think about it\". But the point is that they never think about it.",

My boss/the owner would even clip his toenails in the office and have it drop onto the carpet, while I would proactively clean the carpet so I could have a clean environment.\n\nI understand that others aren't obligated to proactively help me or share useful information they've learned. But I'm also not obligated to do that either.\n\nFrom this point forward, I'm putting my own needs and future first. This doesn't mean I'll stop helping others, but I'll stop wasting my time sharing stuff I've learned without being asked with random acquaintances or strangers. I'll stop helping research issues affecting others. I'll limit my help to those who have helped me, those who have helped my family, or those I see helping others.",

      "selftext": "I (F 30s married) have been getting regular home massages for a while now. My therapist is male and I'd guess in his early 60s. He has always been a little more 'hands on' than previous therapists, with occasional grazes against genital areas (which I didn't raise as an issue at any point) but has a clear regular routine and is otherwise professional.\n\nHe has recently started working out of his own home, and for my last session, suggested I come there, as it was a more relaxing space. Again, when I arrived, everything was set up professionally. He was working out of a large bedroom, but the massage table etc was set up. \n\nThis time, towards the end of the massage, his grazes became much bolder, until he pulled away my underwear and began actively sexually stimulating me with his hands. A few minutes later he seemed to take his cock out and rub it against my hand whilst continuing.\n\nI froze. I know a lot of people say that, but it's the only way I can describe my response. My eyes were already closed from the massage, and I just closed them tighter and acted as though it wasn't happening. In retrospect, of course I should have told him to stop and gotten myself up and dressed immediately, but in the moment I just couldn't. My body instinctively reacted to the stimulation, and I climaxed despite not being in that kind of headspace.\n\nAs soon as he stopped, I started to climb down from the table, but then he pulled his pants off and told me to get onto the bed next to the massage table. I sat down but he moved as though he was going to attempt to penetrate me, and at this point I was able to shake my head and push him away a little. But then - and this is what I'm finding so difficult to come to terms with - I moved to kneeling and offered him oral instead. He climaxed, left the room to clean up and I got dressed as fast as possible. When he returned, he acted as though nothing had happened - just made small talk.\n\nI didn't want it - not the touching, not the oral, but it feels as though it's all my fault. \n\nPlease, be honest rather than kind. \n\nWas it sexual assault?\nDid I bring it on myself? \nWhy the hell was my response to him trying to penetrate me to offer him oral instead of just saying no? \nHave I morally cheated on my husband?\n\nI haven't spoken to anyone about this, because I'm so ashamed of my reaction.",

Every year, I struggle with how to balance those emotions. Even with all my schooling, my experience in deathcare, and my death-positive beliefs, I still haven’t figured out how to fix this. Truthfully, I don’t think I ever can.\n\nI want her to have a beautiful birthday, to feel celebrated and loved, but I can’t ignore the shadow that this day holds for both of us. I don’t know how to talk to her about it without reopening wounds, and I never want her to feel that her special day is overshadowed by grief. But inside me, it always is.\n\nThe last gift I gave her was about four years ago, a hollow sunflower pendant, her favorite flower. You could open it to place ashes or hair inside, and I’d saved some of our mom’s hair from the funeral home. It meant so much to me, symbolizing connection and remembrance. But when I gave it to her, her reaction was quiet, even uncomfortable. She said thank you, but I could tell it didn’t bring her the same peace it brought me.\n\nNow she has a husband and a baby, a whole new life blooming around her, and I’m so proud of her. But I still don’t know what to do or how to help. Maybe she doesn’t need help. Maybe she just needs space. Still, the caretaker in me wants to ease her heart somehow.\n\nI don’t have much to give this year, but I hope she knows how deeply I love her, and how proud Mom would be of both of us, surviving, loving, and still finding our way through this day each year.",

I've always just messed around here and there, mostly with art. Sometimes I wanted to be an animator, other times an author or game developer, or whatever it was that excited me at a given moment. Throughout the years I have fallen more and more in love with writing and now, as a young adult (early 20s), writing is what I love doing more than anything. I believe messing around with random stuff and writing for the heck of it is healthy and rewarding, and I will always keep doing that, but my aspiration is writing to express myself to others and to connect people. This 'dream' feels increasingly more difficult to realise. Maybe it's just a feeling that comes with growing up, or maybe I'm growing too cynical, but the past few years everyone has felt more disconnected than before. A recent thing that made this far worse (at least for me) is A.I.\nWhen reading, I used to feel a 'connection' with the author (wether or not they did a good job), and I loved the process of figuring out what someone was trying to say through their writing. If I figured it out, it would be satisfying and fun. If not, it would feel a little mysterious, because even if the author didn't think about what they wrote, there was a certain intent that I couldn't understand. Today I can only think: 'Maybe there was no intent at all, maybe this sentence wasn't written by an actual person.' Don't get me wrong, I don't believe computers are better writers than humans, but seeing so many people turn to A.I. to write for them (even in my university) has made me afraid we are losing that feeling of connection forever. If I write a novel, there is no way to guarantee the readers that every word came from me. What is the point of reading a novel if it isn't a shared experience? How do I invest in a story if it may or may not be partially generated by statistical chance? I feel silly for thinking this way, but I can't get these thoughts out of my head. I've never been good at socializing (I'm practising and making progress, though!). I have always considered art my way to connect with people. I really don't want to lose this way of connecting. I don't think books or writers will be obsolete at all, but reading has definitely changed for me. Maybe this is just a temporary feeling. I really hope so.",

I found out later in life he had molested one of my cousins. When she told me I felt like the breath had been knocked out of me. I pretty much had a breakdown. I know I was very sexually aware as early as kindergarten. I remember grouping my cousin (a boy same age as me) and showing him where to put his hands on me. Kissing him. Again we were in KINDERGARTEN. I regret this so much and him and I have never talked about it. But I know it’s not normal things for a child that young. I have memories of being in the bathroom with him, us sitting on the floor and me crying because he was trying to brainwash me into thinking he was he only one who loved me and that my mom and brother were evil.

      "selftext": "Hi everyone. for context,  I (19f) have been in a relationship with my bf(20m) for 4 years so far.  I have been feeling recently how different on everything is just not compatible anymore. Let me make this a bit more detailed. so me and him got together when i was around 14 and he 15. we were just there for each other and leaned on each other for comfort. At the time, he had confessed to me 2 times and i have shut down each of them until the 3rd time when he urged me to think about it. To be fair, i didnt think id find a better option than him. He was smart, he came from a great family and seemed to be a loyal and caring partner. I could say i fell for him throughout our first year together. It been lind of up and down for me since then. Hes always busy even when he has nothing to do. and if we spend time hes just dry and doesnt really talk like actual convos, just exchanging news ir statements, except when we game with our friends. Aside from that when were together physically hes almost always on his phone. All that bothers me alot, I dont feel he enjoys his time or values it, he just got used to me and I to him. I feel somtimes that he has wandering eyes, but i have no basis for this aside from his fyp being full of girls. He plays dumb when Im upset about it. we have different views on life generally. hes quite religious even though he does counter that bcs we used to sleep together often and had some recent pregnancy scares and i was kind of disappointed and mad at him for them because i always ask him to use a condom but he never does. I also told him that specific time not to finish inside and he still did. And he gets upset when i deny him anything sexual. Im not religious myself, i actually dont think i believe in anything i just want to exist without the weight of beliefs and he says he doesnt want his household to be as such. I told him i dont want children a long time ago, im still on my stance, he says we have to eventually since hes family is a very famous family and his legacy has to continue. I am not a big fan of his ego and pride and how he sometimea \"doesnt mean to\" but embarrasses me in front of others to seem credible. For example, he was giving his sister a ride to uni last week and passed me by after, this is like 8 am. He met a friend of ours on the way there and our friend asked what brings him to our neighbourhood, my bf says hes coming for me. my neighbour replies \"she really got you here this early?\" and instead of telling why hes here so early(mind you that day was my day off uni during the week, I was the one who woke up to see him) he just said \"oh well, the things we do for love\". And im sorry but that pissed me off. Another time were playing a game and someone on the enemy team calls him babe, as like a term not flirting, like how people say \"dear\" or \"darling\". He goes \"oh well doesnt she know i have a gf! im married!\" i reply to him saying we arent married and there isnt anything official between us and that he could tell the enemy team that hes taken if hed like. He types \"hey can you not call me babe cause my wife is playing with me and she gets jealous.\" now i dont have a problem with being jealous or being called jealous but he does. He never likes saying hes jwalous or that hes protective. It hurts his ego a bit, so i never mention it i get the hint and fix whatever i can. I felt like that was complete disrespect since he wouldnt accept this upon himself but would upon me? I was distraught. Not only that but he called me his wife. I have asked him alot of time to at least propose an engagement, its been 4 years ffs. He always refuses and says his family wouldnt allow it and such. yet he keeps going around telling everyone im his \"wife\" or sometimes mentioning to people at uni om his \"fiancé\" when im not any of that and he just keeps making himself look better in front of them, telling them he pays for some stuff on my end, that ill me SAHW and wont work cause hell carry all the weight and so on. Its just like torture giving privileges and receiving privileges that both of us do not deserve. We arent married and dont want him to ever pretend like we are because hes the reason were not anything but some kids horsing around for the time at uni. I just feel like we wont work out but at the same time i do love him deeply because aside  from this side i complain about, hes caring and looks after me when im sick, he always makes sure im safe and sends me money when i need it(my family is les fortunate than him and some weeks i dont get paid at work), he cares about my mental health; he just got me enrolled in to therapy last week. Hes trying, somewhat i guess. I dont know but i just feel so empty and so tired and so diffrent from the person i want to be. I dont want to dress conservatively, i want to smoke, i want to fool around, i want to travel alone or with my girls, i want to do witchcraft, i want to be comfortable in my skin without feeling like im wrong for it. I want to me unapologetically. I just feel like i can never do that because i depended too much on him and i let him take too much space judging me and nitpicking me at the beginning. i let give him excuses but so does he and im not perfect either i throw tantrums and get super accusatory sometimes and get mad and upset at the smallest of things he does.

I suspected it last year, but I didn’t have proof, and when I confronted her, she told me I was being paranoid. I tried to forgive her back then because I loved her and wanted to make things work.\n\nA few months ago, I finally found proof that she cheated on me last year. She even got an STD and lied about it. She lied about being a virgin and about having HIV though she claims she can’t transmit it to me. Deep down, I had felt something was wrong, and now I know for sure.\n\nI tried to forgive her. I gave her chances. I even stayed quiet for months, tried to act normal, and focused on myself. But every time I confronted her, she cried, said she loved me, said she couldn’t live without me, and accused me of not caring. I realized that people like this don’t cry because they regret hurting you they cry because they got caught.\n\nI made huge sacrifices for her. I come from a Third World country and last year I was eligible to apply for permanent residency in Canada, but I didn’t because she promised to bring me to the US. I gave up an opportunity to secure my future because I trusted her. Now I regret it, because all I have in return is lies and betrayal.\n\nFour months ago, she cheated again. I know this because of messages she sent to her cousin about a guy she was with late at night. I don’t have proof, only messages, but I strongly believe what happened. I also feel scared thinking about the possibility of her lying about a pregnancy or trying to manipulate me in other ways.\n\nI love her, but I can’t keep living like this. I’ve realized what I need to do I’m going to get my papers, secure my future, and one day I’ll leave. I feel sadness, anger, and betrayal all at once, but I also feel clarity I know I can’t trust her, and I can’t keep sacrificing myself for someone who repeatedly cheats and lies.",

There has been no change.\n\nI've always had the idea that there's no point in cheating when in a relationship. I'm also a person that developed social skills very late in life. \n\nHonestly, I just feel like my wife has broken me down. There's so much distance that most days we talk on the phone more than see each other in person. We have had a single therapy session where it was revealed that most times that was on purpose. And I already knew that was the case because not even Jeff Bezos could possibly be as busy as she claims to be. She also thought the therapist wanted to fuck me. So we haven't gone again. \n\nSo it's been feeling like a long distance relationship for a while. She complained that I was touching her sexually and trying to have sex too much years ago. So I stopped doing that. She also said  that she didn't like me waking her up from her small amounts of sleep. She's also the type to push things off until late at night so the little sleep is literally her own fault. \n\nSo now I barely see my SO/Wife and hardly have any sex. She doesn't want me masturbating but I've jokingly indicating that I don't care while also making it known that I really don't. But I don't even like doing that. But I get blue balls so sometimes I have to. And my erections are fairly weak during those times. But they're great during actual intercourse. We do still occasionally have sex. But it's not enough to be enjoyable for me because I always climax quickly because there's long periods in between. It's maybe twice a month at this point. As a 30 year old man that's horrible. \n\nSo now when I go out with the guys I've been much more friendly as opposed to completely reserved with women. It reminds me of those scenes in soap operas where the woman finally confesses infidelity and explains that the other guy made her feel more alive. I totally get that now. \n\nI **have not** had sex with another woman. \n\nThere are other things but this is the biggest of the big things. \n\n**I work full time. She works when she wants extra money. I take care of the kids just as much, if not more than her because I watch them a lot before work and after work and on my off days. I cook half the time.**",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone, I just really need a place to vent. And maybe someone out there can understand what I’m going through. I (25f) have a (45f) mom who raised me solely as long with my grandparents on my mother’s side. For years we had an amazing relationship, I looked up to her so much, and still commend her for her hardships in raising me, needing to work 3 jobs for a portion of my upbringing as she had me at 20. We have had a lot of issues, that I definitely need to and know I should consult with a therapist about to help navigate why I might handle things certain ways. But for now I want to talk about the last 9 years, in 2017 she got rear ended by someone going 40 mph and she was nearing a stop. She had some issues with her neck and got surgery, but since that day she refuses to work. She had an entire lawsuit, against the person who hit her, (it was a cop) and she won. But she now says the accident permanently disabled her, causing her issues moving her neck to the left and her right hand goes numb but. Over the years I’ve witnessed her lifting large packages,  using both hands with zero issue, turning her neck all directions and she has no problems. I have noticed that she uses “her disability” only when she wants something. But the last 9 years she refuses to leave the house, drive, exercise, pick up a hobby. She sits in the same spot on the couch everyday for 9 years, binging TV, eating, getting high on weed, drinking. Which I can only assume has caused this MAJOR drift in who she is, she gets angry so much more, she’s depressed, one day she loves me the next she hates my fucking guts. The last couple years I’ve lived with her here and there but she picks a fight with me over every little thing I do, I pay her rent to live in my room, rn I’m just saving my money to move out FOREVER. But me living here makes her think she’s “mom” of the year, she says I use her by living here. Even though I pay rent and pay for my own food, drink. I work 5-6 days a week, and come home to sleep and on weekends I sleep at my boyfriends. Which she also complains that I’m home to much intruding on her space of just sitting on the couch and I’m at the opposite end of the house, OR I don’t spend time with her enough. But it’s so hard for me to want to spend time with her, she’s negative about every little thing, she doesn’t understand what it’s like in the real world, just what she watches on tv, she’s filled with so much hate. I’ve begged her to pick up hobbies or a small job or something but refuses. Her husband is her puppet who does anything she asks. Idk I just needed to let this out. I’ve lost so much respect for her over the years. Then if I complain I’m tried from work, she says to me everyone works I don’t wanna hear you complain…. Like I just don’t get her. She refuses to change her lifestyle even thought I know that’s what’s causing the strain in our relationship",

But lately, I’ve started to feel like it’s *unfair* to anyone who wants to date me.\n\nNot because I think I’m unworthy of love, I know I have a lot to offer emotionally, mentally, and spiritually. But because being with me often means extra patience, understanding, and sometimes even sacrifice.\n\nThings that many people don’t have to think about in a relationship suddenly become daily realities.\n\nAnd sometimes, I find myself thinking: *why should someone have to deal with all of this just because they care about me?*\n\nIt’s not self-pity, it’s more like guilt. Like they deserve an easier version of life, one without all the complications that come with mine.\n\nBut at the same time, I know love isn’t supposed to be about perfection or convenience. It’s about connection, honesty, and choosing someone fully, including their challenges.\n\nStill, the thought lingers. That maybe being with me is “too much,” or that I’m putting someone in a position that isn’t fair to them.\n\nI guess I’m just wondering if anyone else with a disability ever feels this same internal conflict, between wanting love deeply but also feeling like it’s somehow unfair to let someone love you completely.",

      "selftext": "I was in a relationship for almost 5 years. We started dating when I was 19, in my first year of college, and stayed together until I turned 24.\n\nIn the beginning, I loved him deeply. We basically grew up together and I doubt if I’d be able to invest that much again in a relationship or get that comfortable with anyone again. But as time passed, I started noticing how different we were becoming.\n\nI’m a lawyer, I’ve completed my LLB and am currently doing my master’s. He, on the other hand, only completed his BA and never really pursued anything beyond that. He wanted to become a fitness coach, which I respected at first, but there was no stability in his career path. He later tried content creation, making funny reels on Instagram, but honestly, they were immature and sometimes even embarrassing to watch especially when I thought about how my parents would perceive them.\n\nOver time, I realized that our values and maturity levels just didn’t align. I was growing in a different direction academically, emotionally, and mentally while he stayed the same. He was emotionally immature, reactive, and sometimes insensitive to how his actions made me feel.\n\nHis family didn’t help either. They openly made me feel unwelcome sometimes commenting on my body, on how I looked, and making me feel small and underconfident. His sister was jealous and cold towards me, and his parents gave me negative vibes every time I was around them.\n\nBy the time I turned 24, I had to face the truth: I was no longer happy. I couldn’t see a stable or healthy future with him. The 19-year-old me was in love with the idea of him, but the woman I’ve become wants peace, growth, and emotional security.\n\nAfter the breakup, he’s been carrying out a smear campaign on Instagram claiming I cheated on him and trying to make me look like the villain. It hurts because all I ever did was love him until I couldn’t anymore.\n\nSometimes I question myself did I make the right choice? But then I remind myself that love alone isn’t enough when your values, vision, and maturity don’t align. It’s hard to move on from someone who was such a big part of your early 20s, still question my decision everyday if I got too practical and wasn’t supportive enough for him.",

I’ve been unhappy, I don’t like most of my classes, and I’m having a hard time being engaged with it because I don’t care about the content. I made “friends” but I don’t think I actually like any of them. I haven’t been motivated to do much, not even my hobbies, or passions. I’ve been trying to pull through because it’s starting to affect my  school work. I go to a community college that is relatively affordable, but since I haven’t been able to get a job, the tuition is taking a toll on my single mother. I tried to be more organized, bought a calendar to mark any important dates but I haven’t updated it since September. I decided to skip one lecture because I’ve been struggling with things recently ( they don’t take attendance and the info is posted online) and it just so happened to be the day where we had a test. The class has 3 tests , and the lowest score will be dropped, but I won’t be able to go to school for the second lecture. Spoke to a friend about it, they say that I should be fine because the exams are 40% of my grade. But another problem came up. I was so stupid, I was enrolled in a class and had no idea, so I went to none of the classes today. I assumed that since my school made my schedule for this semester, they’d already made it for the next one, and I was just seeing a class from the next. The class also didn’t show up on the schedule that I was looking at, and at one point I stopped checking my schedule because I thought that I knew my way around things. Anyways, come to find out I have a WN on my record for not attending. I freaked out and emailed the professor, who told me that I couldn’t possibly make up anything ( which I knew but I emailed just in case). I think that my friends from high school who all went away kinda look down on me for my decisions. I met several old classmates from high school in my college, and every time that they see me they ask “what are you doing here?” Because everyone knows me as this super creative person, everyone assumes that I would’ve been in a fashion school, or an art school, but I didn’t even get in, I didn’t even finish applying because I didn’t believe in my chances. And now I’m here, and I feel guilty for making my mom spend around $600+ on this course, but I did give her $380 out of my summer job paycheck towards my tuition.

I do have some friends yeah who i love dearly. But i never really had that youthful joy in me ig.\n\nIm 25m, never really had that youthful fun experience, never had a gf or anything nearly close, had a bad time in school/college for different reasons, money problems at home and im losing my hair fast (and my looks with it..), spent majority of my life so far grinding... Job is pretty hard and stressful as well. At least i have some of my friends.\n\nIdk, just something i wanted to get out ig.\n\n",

I am helping her out, getting her things she can eat/drink, getting her meds, talking to her professors about her medical situation and everything.\n\nI am bad for this as she is sick but I am a little satisfied. I got dengue like half a year ago, and she left me on my own, she never checked on me, she didn't help me much, like when i asked if she could get me some groceries on her way she doesn't want to as she would have to go out of her way to get them.\n\nThere is this other thing she does which is compare that she has it worse. And she has been doing that. whenever she says oh this wasn't as bad for you, I inform her, it was she just didn't know about it and she get annoyed and makes a face.\n\nHer parents eventually came to pick her up and she went home. Now she came back and was telling me about her 'experience' and she tells me that she did not have energy to do anything and her platelets dropped to like 120k. And I inform her that it was the same for me but my platelets ended up dropping to 30k and i did not have the leisure to go home.\n\nShe gets upset and states that as I had gone to all my classes, it means that it did not effect me much, but the truth is I had to take breaks in my 5 minute walk from my dorm to university building and I mostly slept in class. My college has certain minimum percentage for required attendance and I could not have skipped any and my parents would not have been understanding about my situation if i did not reach the minimum criteria, so I did not skip any classes.\n\nIn this whole time, she did not ever check up on me, did not go with me in any of my hospital visits and in general not cared.\n\nWhen she was sick I was overcompensating because I felt bad for feeling good about her being in the situation.  \nI know I am a horrible person for feeling this way but I made sure to not let her realize my feelings.  \nI just wanted to tell this to someone but I know people will judge me for it\n\n**TLDR**: My friend didn't care when I was sick, and she likes comparing she has it worse, I feel a little satisfied whenever she gets upset when I inform her that it was the same or worse for me.\n\nSorry for any errors, and I do not care about proper punctuation. Thank you.",

      "selftext": "Thank you all so much for the kind words and advice you gave me.I truly appreciate it. I honestly didn’t know if I’d ever make an update, but the support and comfort I got from my last post really helped me process things in ways I didn’t expect. I figured I might as well share this, since getting it out before helped more than I thought it would.\n\nI decided to take some of the suggestions and ask someone about the person from my memory. I chose my grandma, since she was also connected to it.\n\nIt took a while to get on the same page, since I didn’t know his name or exactly what he looked like. I only remembered that he was tall, dark, and a friend of hers. I didn’t bring up the details of the memory itself, because I didn’t want to worry her. I just asked if she remembered someone like that who was around when I was little.\n\nShe paused for a moment, and then mentioned a name I didn’t recognize. But then she said I used to have a nickname for him and hearing that nickname made my stomach drop. It was like something deep inside me recognized it instantly, even though I hadn’t thought about it in years.\n\nWhat really threw me off, though, was her reaction. She seemed fond of him. She even smiled softly, like she was remembering something warm. She said he used to babysit me when she ran errands, and that I liked playing with him and always listened when he told me to do something. That’s why she trusted him to help out.\n\nAnd I just sat there, trying to process all that. Because that’s not the reaction I was expecting at all. I thought maybe she’d frown, or sound uncomfortable, anything that would confirm that the heaviness I feel when I remember him makes sense. But instead, she spoke of him kindly, and now I feel… stuck. Confused. Even more unsure of what to believe.\n\nShe told me that he moved to another city which is why he's no longer around and that she is still in contact with him. He even invited her to his son's wedding but she wasn't able to attend it since it was a long drive from home. \n\nI’m still trying to sit with all of it, but I wanted to share this update and thank you all again for the support and kindness you showed me last time.

      "selftext": "Hello, Ive had this condition since high school but lately it has gotten worse! I keep seeing (and sometimes hearing) bugs in my presence! Usually I just see a tiny black dot or two crawling on a surface but when I try to focus on it they fade out. Either black dots or larger white worms that can quickly crawl away when I look straight at them. When I hear an insect which is rare, its usually very loud and it sounds like they are in a plastic bag or in the walls. \n\nHowever no one else in my life has seemed to notice any bugs. I spoke to my mother about finding bugs in her house growing up and she denied about us having any problems with that. I have a cat that I sometimes use to \"reality check\" and he doesnt seem bothered when usually hes the mass killer of insects. I had a meeting with my psychiatrist a few weeks ago and I saw some black bugs crawl on the floor between us which kept distracting me but he didnt seem to see or react to it? \n\nI remember a few years ago when this expeience was still new to me, I used to freak out a lot but have now grown a little used to it. I still have my items just in case the bugs come closer just to feel safe (cedar wood stock, cedar oil, etc) and if I hear a sudden bug related noise I get a little scared and grossed out. But now I can even ignore it, and think its not actually there..  But then what is it? Is it a hallucination? But I thought it only counted as a halluccination if you believe it to be real? Even though it feels uncomfortable and scary for me I can 50% say its just in my head or visison. Or can it be a visual problem, like an illusion or visual snow? I dont know what to believe. \n\nI started eating Olanzapine 5mg a day two weeks ago but I have only seen more bugs than before I ate the medicine, AND I feel super restless now. Im thinking of stopping eating this madication if thats the cause of the increasing bug vision and the painful restlessness because its making me just want to hurt myself even more, or maybe I do have a infestation following me? I try to keep as few belingings and furniture as possible to risk any more contamination following me, among other things. ",

      "title": "I'm Lost After Walking Away From the Love of My Life",
      "selftext": "Hey everyone,I’m throwing this out here anonymously because I’m desperate and confused, and I need to clear my head. I was in a long-distance relationship with my girlfriend, “A.” When we were apart, I felt happier and more in love than ever. I blamed distance for everything, but the truth is I wasn’t fully present. I didn’t force her to stay with me, I was the one running away. Yet I felt my heart swell every time we video‐chatted; I was so, so happy.\n\nA has always been someone who puts me first. She swallow her pain and apologize, even when she wasn’t at fault. Whenever we fought, she’d blink back tears and forgive me first. Meanwhile, I was neglecting her completely.\n\nI broke down the first time I discovered she had met someone else. I interrogated her emails and cried until I couldn’t breathe. Then I realized why she did it: I’d abandoned her. She was alone in a new city, studying for pharmacy exams that she failed, dealing with family issues, and still without a steady job. I was so wrapped up in my own fears, fear of losing her, that I pushed her away. I still don’t know why I convinced myself to leave her when my feelings were so strong.\n\nNow I feel crushing guilt for both of us. I’ve seen a psychologist and prayed Istikharah, and finally I can think straight: leaving my job where every day I feel haunted by regret might be the first step. I’m terrified of becoming unemployed, but I know I must break free to show A that I’m serious. Work can be found again; she is irreplaceable.\n\nEvery memory of us still hits me like a freight train: our first night walk, agreeing to eat the simplest street food, her red blush under dim streetlights, her breathing next to me when she fell asleep. I can’t stop replaying those moments, and it hurts that I abandoned her when she needed me most.\n\nI’ve drafted my resignation letter for October 1st and plan to finish one last project before heading to her hometown. I don’t expect her to welcome me with open arms; I’m prepared for anger, silence, or being ignored. But I need to prove that I’m willing to risk everything for her. Even if she never forgives me, at least I’ll know I tried.\n\nI’m at the point where life without purpose feels unbearable. My friends invite me out, but I can’t shake this heavy chest. Sometimes I wonder if I should’ve stayed in town instead of chasing job security or if I should have fought harder to support her dreams back then.\n\nI know I was cowardly. I betrayed her trust, I lied, and I ran from responsibility. But I still love her, and I want to make amends. I need advice on:\n1. How to approach her after ghosting her, should I send a heartfelt letter or go in person?\n2. How to rebuild trust slowly when I’ve shattered it so completely.\n3  How to cope with my guilt if she still refuses to forgive me.\n\nHas anyone here ever walked away from someone they loved only to realize too late what they lost? What helped you find the courage to face them again? Any guidance or tough love is welcome.\n\nThanks for reading. I’m tired of feeling lost, and I want to do right by her even if it’s the hardest thing I’ve ever done.",

He passed away just two days after being released.\n\nHis wife, Jane, has been nothing but controlling and manipulative since his death. She has been keeping his ashes hostage, saying she will only release them during a remembrance ceremony she is planning for April 18.\n\nThe worst part is she burned her own hair and mixed it into the ashes before dividing them into three vials, one for each of us kids. I cannot even begin to describe how disturbing that is.\n\nShe has also been changing the story about my dad's will. At first, I was told he left her the largest portion of the ashes, that each of us kids would get a vial, and that some of his possessions would go to us. Then the story changed and I was told we only got the ashes, and anything else we received from him was out of Jane’s goodwill. Most recently, I was told that I am not in the will at all, that only my siblings get ashes, and that nothing else is guaranteed unless Jane decides to give it.\n\nI have blocked her and cut all contact. I have even tried to convince my siblings to walk away too, but they are still trying to stay on her good side to get their portion of the ashes. I just cannot do it.\n\nInstead, my grandmother and I have decided to hold our own remembrance in the county where my dad actually grew up. We are also planning to put out our own obituary there that reflects the truth about him and where he came from.

      "selftext": "Hey so I’m a newly 18 year old girl who was exposed to graphically sexual images at like 6 and porn when I was 8. My father was abusive (a narcissist), and my mother was hardly spending time connecting with me in a happy state because she was constantly working and stressed to pick up his slack. I have adhd and my father didn’t let me receive any help for this (as in he became aggressive and violent at the mention of counselling or meds) until I was 16 and had a complete breakdown that could’ve landed me in a hospital months allowed me to see a therapist. In regards to porn, the last time I saw it was at 15 years old and I haven’t since then partly because of research and finding out what I was doing and partly because of very intense shame. In high-school I remember meeting a guy who seemed to like me and thought I was very sweet then immediately thinking that if he found out that I watched porn when I was younger any idea that I was sweet, innocent, kind or worthy of protection or gentleness would just fly right out of his head. I love working with kids, I teach piano and dance but I feel like that isn’t real, and that I’m some sort of con-artist or secret predator because of what I’ve seen. I’m also scared that when the time comes and I find my husband and am ready for intimacy he won’t find it as special. I compared myself alot to other girls because I was really envious of the fact that they got to live just not knowing certain things and that talking about sex was just this kind of giggly, exploratory teen girl moment and for me it was heavy, shameful and I wanted nothing but to not know of sex ever again.",

      "selftext": "Obligatory throwaway, on mobile blah blah. \n\nI messed up royally with my partner. She (27F) and I (29M) have been together for 7 years. We bought a house together. We have 4 dogs together. And I lied to her. \n\nWhen we first met I lied to her about my time in the military. I had been removed from a military program due to a DUI and was really ashamed about it. One day I got really drunk and ended up telling her a lie about it including I had been deployed. It was a deplorable and shitty lie and I recall the day after I realized what I had done I sat in horror. Up until this though I had never had a long term friend or relationship really of any kind (child of abuse/lots of moving/etc) and just assumed that's what the rest of life looked like.  I have since stopped drinking and told her about the DUI and got my life together but over the years I allowed that other lie to propagate and fester. I even supported it with more lies. Over the years I have also lied to her about the volume of my nicotine and marijuana usage. I have cut down on my marijuana usage and am working to cut down on my nicotine usage too. \n\nShe picked at that lie about the military this past weekend until I told her the truth. And she left. She took one of our dogs, went up to her parents, and left. We had a couples therapy appointment scheduled today but between yesterday and today she has decided she doesn't want to try anymore. \n\nIt's entirely my fault. Every single bit of it. I avoided telling her the truth about it because I didn't want her to hate me and leave and caused the exact thing I was terrified about to happen. The guilt has eaten me up for years now and it's all come to fruition. And I deserve every ounce of what is happening. \n\nAnd honestly I can't handle this. She was the sun at my back. The wind in my wings. She was every single good thing in my life and I pushed her away through my own actions. I love her so much it physically pains me some days.  I have an individual therapy appointment scheduled for Thursday because I want to work on myself and improve but I genuinely can't find the will to find the point of it. I want to go become better and not be this vile, twisted person I have become that's comfortable with lying but honestly I can't find it in me to care. She's probably not coming back. And I'm trying desperately to frame this individual counseling to be about improving myself because I want to improve myself but I just want to be a better person for her. \n\nI'm alternating between being entirely and completely numb and so much grief that I'm literally choking on it. I sat down to try to journal it out for the first time in my life and to be quite frank that rapidly became a rather dark and horrific note. And the scary part is I basically have a plan on what to do to get the pain to stop. It wouldn't be difficult and basically nobody could stop me. It's not that I don't want to be alive, it's more just I don't want to....be. I feel like my entire life ended and stopped. My body just hasn't caught up yet. \n\nIt hurts to breathe.  It hurts to feel. It hurts to think. I don't want to \"improve\" for the next person I meet. I want her. And I lost her. And I don't know if I even want to try to come back from this once she leaves for good. It's my fault. All of it. \n\nSorry for the rant. I just don't have anyone else in my life besides her I can talk to about this stuff and I obviously don't want to call and bother her. \n\nBe better than me folks. Don't lie to the people you care about. Because one day they'll get rightly fed up. ",

I caught My beautiful wife of 10 years sexting and having phone sex with another guy. I think the reasons this really really hurts is her and I are best friends. We know each other so well. This was so out of the blue I’m just speechless. I’m so hurt.\n\nWe have never had anything but love in our relationship. In the past I battled with a porn addiction so that may play into it a bit. In fact she used that to kind of justify this.\n\nThe whole things she said was because she just wanted to feel wanted. And it’s not like I don’t want her, we are very close. But she said that she felt like coming from me it wasn’t genuine because I’m her husband. So I have to compliment her and make her feel pretty. But some random guy doesn’t. So she craved that.\n\nHappened literally in only like 4 days. It was this son of a bitch worker at T-Mobile. We went to adjust our plan. He was nice and I even got the sense he was hitting on her a bit. I didn’t think twice, my wife is very attractive and disloyalty is the VERY last thing I would ever think of with her.\n\nHe ended up texting her after we left cause he set it up wrong so he was telling her how to fix it. First of all, he shouldn’t be able to do that right? This motherfucker shouldn’t be having access to my wife’s number and not texting on his personal phone. I plan to call and get his ass fired.\n\nBut he gave her compliments and it made her feel nice. I came back from a hunting trip and my wife’s confidence was through the roof. She was acting sexy and always wanting to screw. I felt like something had changed but I just thought it was for the best. Idk.\n\nFound the text convos on her phone. He had been sending her dock pics and they had had phone sex it sounds like according to the texts. She sent him a picture of her in skimpy underwear.\n\nShe said she just wanted to feel wanted. Why I couldn’t do that myself…idk. I wanna beat the shit out of this guy. He looked me in the eye and then made plans to get with my wife.\n\nShe assures me it was only text stuff. And I actually believe that. I also believe that it wouldn’t go any further. She screwed up but she wouldn’t go that far. Anyway. Found this all out last night. I’m hurting real bad. I still love her. She’s my wife. My trust is so broken. I feel like a little bit of a hypocrite with my battle with porn. She justified what she was doing saying it was the same. I strongly disagree. She was like building a relationship with this guy. He holds a piece of her forever. I would watch random porn.\n\nHad to get this off my chest. Any words of encouragement, guidance or just being mad with me is welcome.",

I’ve never liked confrontation, so I’d try to walk away to calm down, but she’d block the door or grab me to stop me from leaving. She hit and kicked me more times than I can count, sometimes saying it was “just a joke,” other times clearly trying to hurt me.\n\nAfter fights, she’d flirt or message other men, sometimes even arranging to meet them. Financially, she took control of my wages “for joint budgeting,” then refused to give me access to my own money. I even lost a military promotion opportunity because of it.\n\nWhen I left the military, we separated for about a year. She kept me hooked under the idea of “being friends,” but every time I tried to move on she’d pull me back, acting like we were getting back together, then doing what she wanted and claiming we weren’t together after all.\n\nEventually she asked me to talk, and we got back together. She promised things would change, that she’d stop smoking cannabis and focus on building a family. When our son was born, that promise lasted about two weeks.\n\nWhen I told her I couldn’t stay if she didn’t stop using cannabis, she threw our newborn into my arms and told me to “just take him then.” Her mother came downstairs, tried to stop me from leaving, and ended up attacking me with a knife. I defended myself and managed to get the knife away.\n\nI was arrested and convicted, but the conviction was overturned after her own statement confirmed that she’d attacked me. She accepted a caution for affray; I refused one because I knew I’d acted in self-defence.\n\nTwo years later, a drug test confirmed our baby had cannabis in his system. That evidence finally convinced the court and social services that I was the protective parent. My son lives with me now, and his mother has stopped her contact.\n\nI’m not looking for revenge or sympathy. I just want to acknowledge that what happened to me was abuse, even if it took years to see it.",

I told him about 2 talking stages online, but I didn’t mention that I once went on a real life coffee date with someone. It was innocent, nothing happened, and we didn’t even click. I just didn’t want to share that because:\n\nOne . We’re not in a relationship anymore, so he isn’t entitled to every detail.\n\n\nTwo. He’s extremely judgmental and tends to call me names and degrade me whenever he’s upset.\n\n\n\nWe had a really deep conversation recently about how I hurt him in the past and how much it affected his ability to trust and be with anyone again . It actually felt healing  until I started feeling guilty for not mentioning the coffee date. I couldn’t stop thinking about it, so I ended up telling him everything yesterday.\n\nHe was furious. He said I’m disgusting, that I’ll never change, and that I lied again. \nI tried to explain that if I had told him there was something but I wasn’t ready to talk about it, he would’ve pressured me endlessly until I broke down. He admitted that’s true  he would’ve pushed. But he still said that doesn’t excuse me lying.\n\nNow he’s demanding I send him pictures of the guy and tell him his name, but he won’t tell me why he wants them. He keeps pressing and I honestly feel so uncomfortable, but I’m almost at the point of giving in just to make him stop.\n\nSo that's why i posted..\nIs he actually entitled to know everything?\nAnd am I really this terrible, disgusting person he says I am?\n",

      "selftext": "Throwaway account.\n\nMy (25M) wife (28F) and I just celebrated four years of marriage on the first, which is also nine years together. We have been together since I was 16 and she was 19. She was my first and only everything. I love her and care about her, but after a couple years of difficult times I stopped being being *in love* with her about a year ago. I go through the motions in the hopes that the feeling will come back. She’s been verbally abusive for years following a surprise lay-off (she’s been in and out of various entry level jobs since) and I have been physically and emotionally withdrawn as a result, and we are currently working through that together. We are seeing some improvement but nothing consistent. I think because of this situation, I’ve started falling in love with someone else. I am really starting to fall for my classmate (26M).\n\nWe’re both graduate students in the same program so we see each other a lot. I met him two years ago but only started falling for him about 9 months ago when I both A) got closer to him, and B) realized with my therapist that my wife was being verbally abusive towards me. But I think that the worst part is, I would still want him even if everything with my wife was perfect. Because he’s really almost perfect. He’s my dream person. And I feel so gross about that.\n\nI want to preface that I have known for years that I am bisexual, I’ve just never been with a man. So this isn’t a reckoning with my sexuality as much as it is guilt that I’m falling in love with someone that isn’t the woman I am married to and trying to rebuild with. There is a layer to it that feels…strange? I guess? that I’m actually developing real feelings for a man for the first time. The only other person I’ve ever felt this way about was my wife. I don’t know how to describe it. Not quite guilt or shame, but uncomfortable for sure (which is just amplified by the actual guilt of emotionally cheating on the person I have spent almost a decade with).\n\nI just…he really is wonderful and if I were single I would pounce on him. He’s gay so I can’t even cognitively distance myself with the idea that he’s straight. He’s so cute. He’s literally so handsome. He has these big blue eyes and this smile that just makes me wanna pinch his face and kiss him. His laugh plays on a loop in my head in a way that my wife’s just doesn’t. He’s super easy to talk to, he’s so fucking charming and outgoing, he’s so cool and suave and sporty, he’s so intelligent, he speaks multiple languages, hes adorable, he makes me feel special just by talking to and listening to me, he always seeks me out in a crowd, and he works for my literal dream organization! Without giving too much info away, it’s a very well known and well regarded non-profit that kind of just makes you say “fuck you, of course you’re so handsome and charming and intelligent AND you work for this awesome charity, of course you’re actually perfect and amazing.”. I want him so bad. I think about him when I’m arguing with my wife or when she falls back into the patterns of abuse and it just calms me down to imagine him cradling my face and laughing with me about it all.\n\nFuck I am so depressed with my wife. I want him. But I don’t wanna throw away my marriage when we’re working so hard and I really do care about her very deeply. It just sucks and I wish I never met him because it would make my situation so much easier. ",

      "title": "I refused to help myself and now I don’t know what to do at 22",
      "selftext": "I (22f) have been struggling a lot with figuring myself out. I don’t know what to do with my life, career, academics, and relationships. I dropped out of college around 3 months ago. I was already delayed. The plan was to graduate by last year, but that didn’t happen. Everything was going so well during my freshman year, which was during the pandemic. I was a dean’s lister, I had good grades, my professors remembered me because my works stood out. But, everything came crashing down all of a sudden. \n\nBy the end of freshman year, I started slipping. I created half-assed outputs, submitted requirements past deadlines, and then I started actually failing. I became a slacker, I played all day, I focused on other things. And slacking isn’t something you can do, especially since I was working on getting an art degree. You can’t be better as an artist if you don’t draw, right? I was too arrogant. I didn’t think my skills would rust. I thought I could bring back my momentum of good performance, thinking that all of that was just a set back, but it never went back to the way it was. I kept sleeping in. I kept procrastinating. I kept spiraling.\n\nOf course, this affected everything in my life. It killed my passion for everything. From slacking on my academics, I started slacking in my relationships as well. I slowly stopped replying to my parents who both live far away from me separately. I didn’t contact my friends, and I only held onto my girlfriend as my only source of social interaction. I felt guilty, however, I didn’t do all of this in purpose. I kept deluding myself that I wasn’t wrong because it wasn’t any of my intentions. I absolved myself of the responsibility of acting like a daughter, a friend, and a partner. \n\nNow, 4 years later, I don’t know what to do. \nMy parents stopped providing for my college tuition, and in my country, it’s impossible to go to college without your parents’ financial support. I took it all for granted. They don’t check up on me as often because I kept forgetting or ignoring their messages/calls. They’ve lost trust in me and what I say, and I don’t blame them. I thought that ignoring them was valid. They weren’t physically and emotionally present in my life back then. They didn’t make any efforts to get to know me. Then they started to try. They started reaching out to me often, but I stayed angry and bitter.\n\nI don’t talk to 90% of my friends anymore. I stopped showing up, and I wasn’t active anymore in all of my friendships. In short, I was a flaker. I don’t have anyone who I can consider a close friend, and I’m pretty sure no one considers me as one. I stopped getting invited to hang outs, because I was stupid enough to ignore all of their efforts. I let my insecurities get to me. I believed that no one actually saw me as a friend, and that I was just dragging myself along with them. How stupid.\n\nI don’t open up to my girlfriend anymore. I don’t want to burden her, even if she says that she wants to help me. I don’t want her to. I keep failing her. I can’t even take her out on dates or give her gifts. We’re slowly turning into a couple who always fights and is always angry. We used to be so gentle with each other. That seems impossible now. We blow up at each other almost everyday at the tiniest inconveniences. I think it’s all my fault. I didn’t open up. I let it fester. I bottled up everything. I think I bring out the worst in her. She deserves someone who is stable, patient, and understanding. I’m not any of those.\n\nI kept blaming my ADHD, depression, and anxiety. I kept finding someone/something to blame. But it’s all me. I refused to move. I refused to own up to anything. \n\nI’ve lost hope. I keep thinking of hurting myself, as if that can make up for the problems I’ve created. I don’t know what to do with my life. I created and ignored so many problems that I don’t even know where to begin. Is my life even worth fixing? Am I worth it? After everything that I took for granted, after everyone I hurt, can I be forgiven? I don’t know what to do. I want someone to tell me what to do, but if someone does, I know that I’ll fail them eventually.",

      "selftext": "I’m not sure how to describe this properly, but it’s been on my mind for years.\n\nGetting into a good university once gave me a kind of illusion, that I was among the “elite,” or at least moving toward that world. I met all these energetic, ambitious people who had clear goals and confidence. But somehow, I slowly drifted away from that circle from social life, from ambition, from what everyone seemed to call the “right” or “positive” path.\n\nIt’s not that I decided to give up, but I just couldn’t keep up with that rhythm. I’ve become more isolated, more drawn to quiet, personal hobbies, like my own little otaku world. And it’s not that I dislike it. It just makes me feel as if I’m moving toward something smaller, something less meaningful.\n\nNow that I’m entering the working world, I don’t even want to join the big companies that many of my classmates aim for. I tell myself I’d prefer a simpler job with more free time to do what I like, but deep down I know I rarely use that time to create or chase anything big. My genuine inner drive feels weak.\n\nPeople often say, “Just start small,” but my scattered interests feel more like self-entertainment than real growth. They don’t seem to lead anywhere or create any real value. I admire those who build, create, or pursue something meaningful, though I know how beautiful that is. Yet I can’t seem to push myself in that direction.\n\nSometimes I wonder if I’ve just gone back to being my old, ordinary self, that my earlier “success” (getting into a good university, good grades, and so on) was only an illusion created by the school system. Maybe I was never really “one of them” to begin with.\n\nHas anyone else felt like this? As if you once brushed against that “elite world” but never truly belonged? How did you find direction or peace with it?\n\nMaybe my thoughts are contradictory, part materialistic, part idealistic. And I’m just floating somewhere in between. Or maybe I’ve just grown too used to my own quiet kind of nihilism.",

I was denied to go outside, I was coerced to go to military uni by threatening me they will throw me out if I do not.

I've tried ending myself plenty of times and I got shamed and laughed at for it.\n\nI could go on, but I think I made my point.

My mother 60/F has been depressed for the longest time but refuses to get help.\n\nLet me give some background, she found out she has cancer a year ago, she was offered help like getting into appointments with the oncologist because her type of cancer has a high chance of recovery if she gets a surgery done (TAHBSO for the medical people here).\n\nFrom the get go she refused to go to the hospital and refused to see any doctor. Whenever something she does not want to do is brought up she delays to the point that it is cancelled. For example I told her we were to go to get checked by the oncologist, she kept saying that she needs to \"prepare\" for it which took 6 hours of waiting and then for her to refuse saying that she doesn't feel well. Money isn't tight, we have enough to cover her expenses it's just that she does not want to. At home she has completely let herself go the house is dirty, she does not take baths, does not clean up after herself, completely let her part of the house become like a pigsty.\n\nShe treats me like a bad guy for challenging her on her bad habits (Smoking, eating junk, being sedentary etc.) What I find so frustrating is when she feels anything bad she runs to me. When she has chills from time to time she runs to me, when she bled out of her private area who did she scream for? Me. And yet when I bring up that we need to go to the hospital to get her checked I'm suddenly the bad guy.\n\nIt has become so bad to the point that when I hear her voice, I become angry. I always yell at her, I started hating her so much. It sucks. I love her I truly do and I find myself crying out of frustration in silence but I cannot tolerate her right now, her very presence makes me angry I don't know why. I want to provide for her needs as best as I can but I am not in a good place mentally. I feel really guilty every time I yell at her and I feel as if I'm going to explode. I work in healthcare it's a very stressful job and when I get home I also get stressed out by her. Sometimes I think about leaving the house because I can't stand her. We're dysfunctional as F\\*CK.\n\nI hope this slump would end because I don't want to spend the next few years hating the one who gave birth to me. God help me.",

      "selftext": "When I was a kid getting hurt always felt like doing something wrong. My parents never reacted with concern just irritation. If I scraped my knee or fell off my bike it was never “are you okay” It was “why weren’t you paying attention” or “that’s what you get for being careless” I learned early that pain meant trouble not comfort. I didn’t think much of it until recently. I was playing apex with a few friends the other day and I made a simple mistake that cost us a lot. Before anyone could even say anything I blurted out “It wasn’t my fault the lag messed me up” Nobody was upset but my heart was pounding. That same instinctive panic hit me like the one I used to feel as a kid when I knew I was about to be yelled at.\n\nIt made me realize how deep that runs. Even now I still try to hide when I’m hurt or downplay mistakes because part of me expects anger instead of empathy. It’s strange how those small moments from childhood can quietly shape the way you react to things years later.",

      "title": "I (29M) cheated on my girlfriend (30F) and feel suicidal",
      "selftext": "Until recently, I had been a in relationship with a girl for about 6 months (before this my last relationship was about 10 years ago). She's a really sweet girl and I loved her (and still do, despite what people will say). But for the past few years, I've struggled badly with depression, and many events this year had led me to what I thought at the time was rock bottom. I lost almost all of my savings, initially just to an unfortunate event, but subsequently through gambling. I started going to a counsellor about that a few weeks ago but wasn't finding it to be much help yet. And I stopped progressing in my career, to the point where I feel like a total failure. \n\nI think the very start of my depression was when my dad cheated on my mum several years ago, and my mum was suicidal at this time (told me she was thinking of ending it) but thankfully she is still with us. I developed a severe hatred for my father, I couldn't understand how he could ever do that to anyone.\n\nAlong with this, I've felt incredibly lonely for the last 10 years. Finally this year I met someone, and it was going great for quite a while. But recently I realised that she was showing very little affection for me, and it was cause for concern. \n\nWe had a weekend away recently, and afterwards I was dropping her off at the bus stop, but we'd just had a (very small) argument about a minor thing. When she left, I said \"love you\", to which she just waved and said \"bye\". Which I was pretty upset about, and getting worried.\n\nI was planning to have a chat to her about the lack of affection, but I had an upcoming holiday planned, for 2 weeks away with friends, on the other side of the world. \n\nWe had initially agreed that I would stay with her for the night before my journey (which was going to be 20-30 hours) and her house was about 2 hours closer to the airport, so it made sense.\nBut the day before, shortly before I was about to leave, she told me that she didn't want me over because she had a late day at work and having me over would stress her out more. I could tell that something was up obviously, and she said \"We can speak when you're back\" (in 2 weeks).\n\nThis was concerning for a few reasons, firstly, she didn't want to see me the night before I'd leave for 2 weeks, secondly, the idea of having me over was adding to her stress instead of being a comfort, thirdly, she didn't seem bothered at all about changing my travel plans last minute and adding 2 hours to my already long journey.\n\nI think I knew then that something bad was coming, and basically I assumed she didn't love me anymore. \nI was thinking about this for about 30 hours on the way to my holiday, and when I left I didn't get a message from her for quite a few hours, until she sent a basic, \"Hi [name], safe travels, enjoy your trip!\" message (previously, she would always say \"my love\" or something like that, or at least some romantic emojis). \n\nAnd then that whole day, and the next day, there was no affection shown at all, no calling me \"my love\", reacting with thumbs up instead of hearts. But she mentioned that we need to have talk but she didn't want to until I got back. I tried to arrange to talk to her while on holiday instead, but the timezones meant she couldn't (well, we probably could have in her morning time, but she was barely texting me at all, so it didn't happen). \n\nSo, for the whole flight and since then, I'd basically felt the worst I'd ever felt. In my head I knew she was going to leave me, and the relationship was over. She was the one good thing left in my life and I'd lost her. This was the worst I'd ever felt, and I already hadn't slept at all for several days because of the gambling losses and my career going down the toilet.\n\nBut, on the flight over, I was sitting beside a woman probably about twice my age, who barely spoke any English. At the end of the flight, she asked for my help filling out security forms, so I did, and she handed me her phone and said \"give me your number\", and I thought she wanted it in case she had any language issues with security. I went ahead and gave her it.\n\nAnyway the next day after the flight I get a text from that woman, just saying hello. I responded and then she started asking where I was. I thought it was weird, but I replied and made basic conversation, even though it made little since with her broken English.\n\n I didn't find this woman attractive at all (in fact I found her quite unattractive and was rude and annoying on the plane), and there was literally no chemistry or anything between us whatsoever. And I thought (and still believe) she really just wanted a green card. She was staying stuff like she wants to marry me (literally the day after I spoke to her for about 20 seconds on the plane).\n\nBut then, the conversation turned dirty, and I ended up asking her stuff like \"What would you like to do to me\" and things like that. At one point I asked for nudes, pretty much knowing she wouldn't, but just wanting to see what would happen. I don't really know why I did this, I think mostly curiousity. She wasn't visually attractive to me at all. \n\nTo be honest at the time I guess I thought it was kind of amusing/entertaining (shameful, I know, but at the time it just felt like I was talking to a chatbot or something, it didn't feel real) given the age difference and randomness of it and just wanted to see what would happen, but also, at the time, I just wanted to feel like someone was actually interested in me, because I was feeling so unwanted and unloved. But in reality, I knew neither of us actually liked each other. \n\nAnyway, in the end she suggested that I come over to her hotel to do things. I didn't, I knew this was wrong. \nBut the fact that I was doing any of this stuff in the first place just makes me feel so ashamed and disgusted with myself. I couldn't sleep for several days, and of course wasn't enjoying my holiday at all, constantly thinking about this, but also just waiting for my girlfriend to tell me that the relationship was over.\n\nEventually, I managed to get texting my girlfriend for a bit of time, and basically told her to just tell me she doesn't want to see me anymore, because I already knew. She wanted to wait til got I back, but then yes she admitted this was the end.\n\nWe managed to have a call the next day, which was very emotional, and basically it turned out she still thought I was a great person but felt a lack of connection. This kind of shocked me because it seemed like she still cared about me (albeit not romantically) when I'd been stuck thinking she didn't care about me at all. \n\nBut then it really hit me again about how bad it was, that had texted that stuff to the woman from the plane. I felt (and still feel) gross, disgusted, and ashamed of myself. I felt I had to tell my now ex-girlfriend about this. I did and we were texting back and forth about it. She basically forgave me immediately and actually said she's sorry she caused this, she felt guilty for the lack of affection and making me feel this way.  \n\nWhile I appreciate that she forgave me, it kind of makes me feel worse, because I know what I did was wrong and I don't deserve forgiveness, and I can't forgive myself for this. \n\nAnd worst of all, after telling her this, I asked her if the relationship was already over at that point (when I was texting the woman (not that that would make it okay)). She said doesn't know, she was still deciding at that time. \nSo that makes me feel so much worse, because in my head at the time, I had already accepted that she had dumped me, or so I thought. When in reality it ended up being a few days later.\n\nSo since then (a few days ago) I've barely thought about anything else, haven't slept, and feel worse than ever. I don't know how to accept that I'm a cheater, because i always believed these were the worst possible human beings, and now I am one. I don't know how I can live with myself anymore. I hurt someone I love (even if she didn't love me anymore at the time).\n\nI'm still on this holiday and don't fly home for another week. I feel awful and don't know what to do. \n\nIf anyone has actually read this, sorry for the massive wall of text, I know none of it excuses what I did, but I felt I just had to spit it all out.",

One worked while the other didn't, and my sibling was in school a while before I was, so I ended up home with parent #2 while parent #1 was working for around 8 hours a day.\n\nI was a quiet but unruly kid. I never meant to be, but I was curious about everything, as children tend to be. I would get into things I wasn't meant to get into, I would accidentally find bad things on the internet, I'd often get myself hurt, and that frustrated parent #2, who didn't look after me much during these times, as they were sleeping for much of it.\n\nWhen I would do something that upset them a particular lot, I remember one of their worse punishments, and one of the times they did it. I had to have been about three or four, and I guess I'd gotten into my parents' weed stash. I know that that's what it was now, because when I visited parent #2 years later, after my parents' divorce (I was around 14), they brought this story up. They almost sounded proud about it, it was weird. Anyway, I was only three or four, so I obviously didn't know what to do with any of it, but parent #2 got so upset with me then that they yelled at me (this was one of the first times that parent #2 yelled at me I remember, it was usually parent #1 doing the yelling at that point), took me to the bathroom, and made me wash my hands under scalding hot water. It's something that still affects me today in that I still do it (I have Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, I think it's at least partially related to that), and while it doesn't hurt now, I know I should stop because it dries out the skin and is pretty unsightly. \n\nAnyway, that's what I had a nightmare about.

      "selftext": "To start, this happened a few years ago but I’ve been thinking about it a lot lately. I had this friend at 16, Lisa (same age), and just recently stopped being friends with her now that we’re 20. she regularly accused men she didn’t like of rape or groping or whatever else she could think of. Anytime her life would get a little boring she’d all of a sudden have a huge pregnancy scare that ended in a miscarriage. The miscarriage thing happened about 7-8 times a year for 3 years. I’ve known multiple people who were all fine people but then they would do something that mildly irritated her or made her feel slighted and next thing you know she’s telling everyone they violently raped her or sexually assaulted her in some way. Not only has this happened a LOT but every single time she refused to do anything about it. She never told her parents that something happened. She would always vehemently refuse to show any type of proof of what happened (even if she said there was proof she would never show it). She would never go to the hospital to get a kit done even when multiple people said they would go with her. When we were 17 she got deep into an abusive relationship and started using meth. She called me one day saying she found a cool guy and we should meet because he gave her a kitten. I said sure because I was trying to help her out of that situation and thought if I spent time with her she would stop or something. The guy was just a normal dude I guess. And the kitten was nice. But the next day she called me screaming crying saying he had raped her and tied her to a bed in the middle of the night and asked if we could meet up so she can talk about it. Again I said sure and met her at a park nearby where I found out the dude had to give the kitten back to his grandma (who he had stolen it from) and she was upset at him for that.  She also found out he was friends with her abusive on and off girlfriend and didn’t tell her. So I guess as revenge she decided to pull the “he raped me and I’m a victim, I have all the screenshots and proof.” While at the park she refused time and time again to go to the hospital to get a rape kit done, refused to tell her mother, refused to tell her other best friend who she was closer to but lives in a different state. Even argued with a past social worker when he advised going to the hospital if she wanted anything done about it. The whole day this was happening she was going on and on about how her ex was going to regret being friends with him and how she was going to “crush his life to pieces” but after so many times of this happening I started to not believe her. About a month later we had gone no contact when I got a call from a detective. The detective said he was investigating a case and that my ex friend had given him my name and number to interview me since I knew what happened. He brought up the dude with the cat and said how it’s a rape case now since he was 19 and she was 17. And in all honesty I just told him the truth. I told him how this is NOT the first time she’s accused someone of rape after pissing her off. I told him how many “miscarriages” she had had from every man that supposedly raped her over the past 3 years. And I told him that she was an impulsive liar who would do about anything to cover up any of her wrongdoing. He ended the call and just said that he would call me back if he needed to chat again. About 5 months later I’m talking to my ex friend again and she brings up how the case went to a detective but “randomly got dropped due to lack of evidence”. Sometimes I think I’m a horrible person for telling the detective the truth, because what if? And what if I was a the reason a bad person is free now? You know? But at the same time I couldn’t imagine getting false accusations that completely ruin your life as a man. And that’s what seems like was the most likely outcomes So maybe imma bad person, but I don’t think what I did was wrong. ",

He deleted all the old pictures, and something in my gut tells me he’s chasing a new girl. The thing is… I know this girl. She’s really nice, innocent even, and I can already see the pattern repeating. Part of me wants to warn her.. not out of jealousy, but because I know exactly what he’s capable of. He plays the same game: acts charming, deep, emotionally open… then manipulates and hides things until the damage is done. I truly don’t want drama, but I hate the idea of watching another person get burned by him while I stay silent.",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI just need to let this out somewhere because it’s been eating me up inside. I’m a 22-year-old autistic guy, and lately I feel like I’ve completely lost my direction in life. I wake up in the morning and don’t really see a reason to get out of bed. I go to sleep at night wondering what the point of all this even is.\n\nI graduated with a degree in Computer Science because I’ve loved software development since I was 14. Coding used to make me feel excited and proud, it gave me a sense of purpose. But now, I can’t seem to find a job in my field. I’ve applied to so many places and got nothing back. I’ve tried working on personal projects, but I always end up doubting myself. I keep thinking, “This isn’t good enough.” I worry people will ask, “Is that really the best you can do?” That kind of fear just paralyzes me before I even finish anything.\n\nMy parents don’t support what I’m doing at all. They say things like “You’re wasting your time,” or “You should get a real job that pays.” I understand where they’re coming from, we live in a country where the cost of living is insanely high and they’re stressed too but it still hurts. I can’t just magically start earning a lot when I’m still trying to build experience.\n\nWhat really breaks me is how often they insult me. They say things like “You’re a failure,” “You can’t do anything right,” or “You’ve failed at everything you’ve tried.” Hearing that from your own parents destroys any motivation you have left. I’ve been trying so hard to move forward, to prove that I can build a life for myself, but every time I start to make progress, their words echo in my head and I shut down again.\n\nI don’t want to give up. I still love programming. I still want to work in tech. I want to build something meaningful and prove to myself that I’m capable. But right now, I just feel empty. I don’t know how to find that spark again.\n\nIf anyone has been through something similar, or has any advice on how to keep going when you feel like this, I’d really appreciate hearing it. Even just knowing that someone understands would mean a lot.\n\nThanks for reading this.",

      "selftext": "Hi\n\nSo that's the story. I am currently married and the mother of three children. The first child (girl)  will soon be 8-year-old.  You can already guess where this topic leads. Before the birth of our first child, we had a on and off relationship with my current husband and some disagreements with each other. Anyway, I haven't asked him yet and I don't want to know if he had anyone else in the meantime, but anyway, I had another acquaintance at the time, so we'll call him Joe, with whom we tried to have sex once (the emphasis is on the word we tried). Anyway, I felt that relationship is not right  with Joe and somehow we ran into our future husband again. It wasn't long before I found out I was pregnant. It was a surprise at the time because I was actually using a contraceptive (hormonal device). Later, the doctor consoled that fluctuations in hormones could also affect. Anyway, I did my math and could only calculate the potential father based on the estimated date of birth on ultrasound (since  I didn't have menstruation at the time in connection with that contraceptive). The months passed, the baby was born, and everything rather referred to my dear husband. Years passed and now we have two more children - the first is a daughter and the second is sons. And we've also considered the 4th child. \n\nBut for the past few months, I've been wondering if the father of the baby is still who I initially thought who was. Yes, I can be considered incredibly stupid and claim that every woman should know this, but at the time really didn't even consider the other option very much. The other man had brown eyes, I had greens, and the husband has bluish gray (but ibrown is also very common in his family). The baby was born with blue eyes and then turned green. But lately I've noticed her eye tone has changed even more and is more brown-hazel now. Something in me has triggered doubts over the past few months and compared child to Joe, with whom I unfortunately see even more similarities. Luckily, the only thing in my husband's favour is that we all have the same blood type as the child, but Joel has another. It also comforts me a little that even a younger childs eyes are also turning slightly hazel.  But still, sons are quite different from the girl. They're pretty much one-on-one with my husband, and then I stand out with my daughter. We're pretty similar, but the older she gets, the more traits I see fit into Joe's look. \n\nSo I'm totally stuck. \n\nOn the one hand, yes, some kind of home DNA test could be done on the one hand (although they are not very common in my home country). On the other hand i feel like i'm in a sort of Schrödinger's cat situation- as long as i don't know, i can still cling to hope that i'm just imagining things. \n\nI can't imagine telling my dear husband that his beloved daughter is not his. Even if we endure this relationship in some way, it's definitely not the same anymore. Specially feel so sorry for my daughter, who is very close to her dad. \n\nOn the one hand, I could keep it in me forever and hope that nothing will change, but that knowledge will eat me inside. I've made time for a psychiatrist and I've been there, but since I don't really trust anyone, I don't dare say what my recent panic attacks are, etc. And I've really considered all sorts of things in my head. I understand that all of this is accompanied by a major depression. \n\nIn addition I'm not financially dependent on my husband so that's not the issue. And i know that  it is too late but i really don't want to hurt him.  In addition  I can say for sure that Joe wouldn't want to communicate with his new potential child.",

I hate how my therapist recommends quitting, without suggesting how to earn money. If you easily can switch job, great for you. I tried, but if I find a workplace that requires commute with train or car I rather stay at my current place, reachable by walking there.\n\nI hate how work is utterly meaningless but you're still required to show up. I hate how I am \"indispensable\" but my request for reduced hours is pending for more than a year. I hate how they know I am breaking. I hate how I didn't got reprimanded when I yelled at a customer and threat to beat him up (it was justified). I hate how at some morning I just can't get up because I'd rather die than going to work. I hate how they pretend to be angry about it but still won't let me go.\n\nI hate showing pills into my body against \"depression\", while my psychiatrist tells me the circumstances are bad, but I'm mentally better than most people he saw. I hate that my psyche still drags me down even thinking about work. I hate knowing I won't get retired, the current retirement plans of the government wont work in the long term. I hate pretending to care about my future. Yes, there's a SO, yes, theres a flat to pay, yes, I want to stay with my cats, but if it means not going to work anymore, idk.",

It was my favorite thing to think/daydream about. Now it sends me into a complete panic. I stopped dating for a few months and for the first time in my life, found contentment in being intentionally single. \n\nI recently met this guy, however, and I told him that I’m struggling with dating and romantic relationships rn, and that if we were to ever try it, we’d have to take things extremely slow. He agreed to do just that.\n\nWe had our first date scheduled for tonight and I have tried to cancel it twice already. The first time was because I had a full blown panic attack last week thinking about it, and then I panicked again last night thinking about it and feeling like we had incompatible communication styles. We ended up cancelling the date and agreeing to just chat more, but I cannot shake this feeling of fear.\n\nI have made peace with the fact that there is no one out there for me. I have particular needs/standards that only leave me open to unicorn men (e.g., Christian liberals), and I’m not willing to settle for the sake of not being lonely - especially now that I’ve found contentment in singleness. \n\nThis guy seems promising. However, I don’t think I’m genuinely ready or willing to make myself vulnerable again only to be disappointed at the end. The guy who eventually told me he was aromantic was THE most promising man I’ve ever dated 🙃I have dated/chatted with SO many men and have been disappointed by them all in some way or another.

Initially, it was just because my acne was pretty bad, and after I started proper treatment with my dermatologist’s advice, I became more comfortable in my skin.\n\nFast forward a year, my acne is much better than it was, but it still hasn’t left me completely. Right now, I have comedonal acne which is pretty stubborn to get rid off so it’s gonna take awhile, but I’m consistent with my skin care. The worst part isn’t how I see my acne at the moment though, it’s how other people react to MY skin. I know people say “no one notices your imperfections as much as you do”, but in my case it’s the exact opposite. Right now I don’t think my acne is that bad, it’s healing, but my mom is always telling me to stop eating junk food cause my face is “already like this” whenever she sees me with a snack, my grandma even said “those are marks of sin”,… LIKE WHAT? My sisters also sometimes comment on my texture whenever their skin clears up cause they have hormonal acne which is less stubborn than mine. My friends used to comment a lot on my skin as well, asking “what happened?” (I wish I knew :]) or suggesting ways to get rid of it like “wash your face”, “eat healthy”, etc. I had to literally ask them to stop talking about it which was awkward but they eventually did, even though I can physically feel them looking at my skin every time we speak. However, recently one of my friends sent me this reel about how I’ll be shocked to see you without makeup (recently I’ve been wearing makeup more often cause I’m insecure) and that one really stung cause I can’t wear makeup these days without people commenting on how that’s the cause for my acne or how they can still see it through my concealer. Like I think I’m okay looking but it’s like now they only think I look decent because of my makeup? I can’t win and honestly it’s exhausting. I find myself constantly avoiding eye contact or white lighting cause I KNOW people are gonna have something to say and I’m way too insecure right now to just brush it off.\n\nI know my skin will eventually clear up even if it takes time but I don’t know how to get through right now, where it feels like my skin dictates my mood.\n\nIf anyone’s going through something similar, how do you stop caring so much about the comments? How do you feel confident again when people keep pointing it out?",

      "selftext": "So, I was lying in bed with my girlfriend a few nights ago, and she randomly asked me how sex is for me, like if I’ve ever had any issues or whatever.  \nI told her honestly that I sometimes have whiskey dick, that it’s happened before and I don’t make a big deal out of it.\n\nThen, completely casually, she said something like,  \n“Oh yeah, that happened to a guy I was with once, he couldn’t get it up and then he started crying.”\n\nShe laughed a little and said, “It’s not a big deal though.”  \nBut honestly, it just hit me weird. I froze.\n\nBecause the truth is, something similar actually happened to me before, years ago, with someone else. I didn’t cry in front of her, but after I left, I did. It was humiliating and it stuck with me.  \nSo hearing my girlfriend talk about that story like it was some casual anecdote felt… gross. Like, why would you even tell me that?\n\nShe wasn’t trying to hurt me, I know that. She’s just very open and sometimes thoughtless about what she says. But it completely killed the moment for me. Since then, I keep replaying it in my head and feeling this weird mix of disgust, shame, and resentment.\n\nI didn’t say anything at the time because I didn’t want to seem insecure, but deep down it really bothered me. It’s not just the story, it’s the fact that she thought it was okay to share it, while we’re in bed, talking about sex.\n\nMaybe I’m overreacting, but honestly it made me lose some respect for her. Some things you just don’t say to your partner.",

They would be awkwardly hunched over and just looked so uncomfortable.\n\nEvery room I was in, thin people were the minority, if they were even in there. Now dont get me wrong, there's a lot of fat people in the city I live in. But I have never seen so many large people in one space. And they are all so large.\n\nIt really flipped a switch in me.

      "title": "I hate life. I feel hopeless and lifeless. I don't know why I was born in such an aggressive culture that I can't connect with, I was motivated to make change but nothing changes",
      "selftext": "I hate my country and disagree with it's actions, it's Israel. The more I read into research of reincarnations the more it made sense to me that people choose where to be born. No matter how much I used to always endure everybody and be gentle with them trying to show them that they don't have to be so defensive and aggressive with me no one really changed. I don't know what's the reason that I was born here and endured so much bullying and harsh treatment. Eventually I found out that I have light schizophrenia which means that I'm fine when I don't have episodes but I'm sensitive as fuck to negative feelings that even manifest as pain in the body often. I don't want to kill myself because I know that my sister and my parents will be devastated but I'm really tired of living. I tried moving to another country but I couldn't do it with my condition. It's difficult to find friends because I rarely vibe with anyone here. However when I was traveling to another country I would make friends so easily in there and they would say how I seem so much like their countrys people, some even told me that they think I was from their country in my past life. In my own country I get mistaken as a foreigner all the time. I get it, it only means that I'm not the only one who can feel it. \n\nIdeally I'd look for others with my condition and make friends with them, because they likely won't be strong enough to have a job either and so it would be less weird to be their friend. The pool of people to find a partner out of seems really small that way. But more than all I'm just bored out of my mind. Life used to be so exciting to me and it's not anymore. Not at all. I'm bored. Various things used to give me profound feelings but now I rarely feel. I'm in pain because I hate my situation. I'm asking myself what is all the pain I've been through for. If I could finish this life by going to another country with the added perspective of my experiences until now maybe I'd see what was special about growing up in an aggressive country as a very gentle person, but no. I can't. My life proves that even under propaganda social pressure and fear I won't support war, I'll keep looking for a way to make peace and eventually realize that my own country is in the wrong and that I'm being lied to. I can take that W for myself and maybe that's what I came here to hone but what about the next 60 years of my life? \n\nThe online friends that I make get busy and stop logging in, it makes sense. Being friends online isn't as fun. I won't have kids because it's irresponsible. I likely won't find a partner because who would want someone with light schizophrenia and who would I find out of the tiny pool of others with a condition like mine. I won't get to find a job that interests me or even volunteering somewhere that interests me. Not only because I'm weak as fuck ever since my schizophrenia erupted but also because I'm fed up with this fuckass country and don't believe that it respects me to be peoples punching bag just for them to not change at all. In the countless places that I've volunteered until my schizophrenia erupted, I was always bullied and hogher ups would always support the bully and ignore my situation. You could say hey that teaches you compassion but I was really compassionate even as a kid so I don't think I needed that to become the type to help others when they're being bullied. I can't know but that's how I feel. I would never pick up fights or retaliate when others would fight me. I was rather really confused about what's driving them to be mean to me for no reason. I really, don't want this life anymore. I don't enjoy things as I used to. I deal with a lot of pain. I don't see a future for myself. \n\nGrowing up I always thought that I must be not understanding people well. That because I'm young I must be still clueless and that's why I piss people off and can't connect with them well. That I'll somewhen figure out how to connect with people better and better until I can make people understand each other better and fight less. I used to live while pitying everyone deeply for how much they fight for no good reason and wanting to learn how to help, believing that it only makes sense that I'll find the key as I grow up. But after I've learned more from interacting with other cultures I think the people here are just very manipulative and self centered. They get pissed off because of many reasons but it's their default. You can't make interesting conversation with them because they don't want to, they think in aggressive ways and they aren't interested in what you're saying unless you agree with them or seem normal to them. They're always judging people and there's always heaviness in the air unless you're repeating what everyone else says in an aggressive tone that hides your insecurity. My values don't align with theirs at all and even if I didn't have schizophrenia I didn't see a future in here anymore. I'm tried of having to fight people all the time everywhere I go, for the most mundane things they fight and cause trouble. Now that I know that I am schizophrenic I can barely see myself making friends. They argue about things, they talk about boring things, and that's about it. I'm really burnt out. Probably had I had a best friend, and some easy activities to go to sometimes, I'd enjoy life again. But the friends suck and so do the activities. Most of all I'm asking, what is the point? This is too much. What's the meaning? Again, if I still had open options in my future I'd keep hopeful and look for a meaningful future. Maybe my experiences will make sense to me. Maybe they taught me appreciation to cultures who aren't as insecure and aggressive, and an understanding that people are welcome to join me but I don't have to pity everyone who is lazier and more aggressive than me. I don't have to wish to help others who are struggling all the time. But with this empty future all I can see is a lot of abuse in my life by others and now a lot of misery in my life alone",

      "selftext": "Help me please\n\nHello! Uhm well I'm gonna lay out everything I've been feeling. I try my best not to self diagnose and let my psychiatrist do all of that. Uhm. So ever since I was a kid, I was fascinated with violence. I always fought with kids as a kid myself and just always argued with everyone.\nI was abused for years as a kid by my school teachers and I was sexually assaulted by my uncle when I was 9.\nAnd then the abuse from my teachers started again as a teenager from 8th grade to tenth.\n\nWhen I was young, pre teen, i came across gore, and videos of people being hurt and dying. At first, I was disgusted and traumatised.. but.. a part of me was curious. I looked again, and again, and again, and again, until it just.. got addictive. And now I watch it every other day until I'm satisfied and I move on. \nI have fantasies about killing people and i like the idea of hurting others physically and emotionally. I think I do have empathy. I definitely do. I cry, i feel sad, i feel hurt, i feel guilty. I feel emotions. I don't think I'm a psychopath. But again i won't self diagnose or eliminate possibilities.\n\nI always feel happy when others fear me, or when others treat me like a higher being or better than them. I like control and fear. And the idea of being worshipped feels so.. good.\n\nI definitely am a narcissist. I love myself. And I have alot of self compassion. I do believe I am smarter than most. Academically and generally.\nAnd I do always feel like I am better than others.\n\nNow I understand that's \"wrong\" I should feel these things. But, i can't help it. I don't want to change. I just want to know what's going on with me.\n\nI even planned out murders, how I would kill my family if I ever did. How i always take random alleyways hoping someone would try to hurt me so I can use the excuse of self defense to kill someone. \n\nI am suicidal too. I tried many times but I am too much of a wuss to go through with it.\nI am diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I do have social anxiety but also I am extremely good at mimicking other people's energy/personality and I can just switch my moods and personalities whenever I want. I am charming and i can make alot of friends. And it's so fun to manipulate people, like on discord. I'd find someone to talk to, match their energy, make them like me, no. Make them LOVE me and make them NEED me and then when I'm bored i throw them away and get to a new person.\n\nI cry alot and I feel sad all the time, i always feel scared when I'm alone, as if there's someone watching me, i have this woman in my head, a grey woman with a weird grin always watching me. I don't visually see or hear her, i do imagine here being there in my head, i don't do it intentionally it just comes into my head, but when I look around she's not there.\n\nI am very good at reading other people's mood.\n\nI also like the idea of making someone cry. Like, torturing. I like when they scream. Recently I saw a video of some cartel members burning some dude alive. The screaming was so..funny I watched it so much. \n\nWhat do I do. Should I tell all of this to my psychiatrist?\n\nI'm pretty sure I'm forgetting like 10 other things I wanted to say but whatever.\n\nI know conduct disorder can be a possibility so I'll talk about that to my psychiatrist. I talk to myself alot. Too much even. ",

      "selftext": "Heyyyy Reddit. I need to get this off my chest because I feel like I’m going insane.\nI (19F) have a friend, we’ll call her Riley (20F). I met her about a year ago at work, and we clicked right away. She was funny, loud, confident, and she made me feel included when I really needed it. Her life always sounded too good (or bad) to be true, There was always something crazy going on, and it was always the most entertaining thing to be around her.\nWe had a mutual friend from work, Jack (20s M), who I used to have a huge crush on. A few months later, Jack brought in a new girl, Tess (22F), and they started seeing each other almost immediately. I had no idea at first, and was slightly dissappointed when i found out. I just hoped they would still be my friends. Around that time Riley began telling me all these awful things about them. She said they made fun of me for my weight, called me ugly and a doormat, she claimed that Tess threatened me, and She said Jack was just “using” me for attention and leading me on.\nI believed her, and I trusted her. So I distanced myself from them. I didn’t even question it because Riley always sounded so sure of what she was saying. Looking back now, i feel like she was isolating me from everyone else.\nAfter our friend group fell apart, she went away to work in Michigan for a summer (a country club job with gold cards and high paying, old, affluent men) but when she came home, things started not making as much sense. At all. I started noticing cracks in her stories and when I started \"fact checking\" what I found made me question my friendship with her altogether.\nHere’s just some of what I’ve noticed.\n\n• She told me she was trafficked into the U.S. and Germany by a “family friend,” that she was sexually assaulted, and had to escape. She said she doesn’t have ID, doesn’t have a visa, and uses a fake military ID to get into our local commissary. She said she sends money back to her parents in Mexico who, by the way, she also claimed were abusive and “sold her.” Then out of nowhere, her parents are suddenly in the US, and she’s living with them again.\n\n• She’s lied about her mom’s name and her last name multiple times. First her mom was Esmeralda, then Johanna, then Matilda. I eventually looked her up on Facebook and found her. They look identical. Her mom lives in a beautiful home, went to Liberty University, and they even went on a cruise together in 2021 (there’s a picture of the backs of their heads on the ship). When I asked about it, Riley said it was “her aunt who got a name change and plastic surgery” and claimed she “doesn’t remember” if it was her in the photo. What the actual fuck.\n\n• She told another friend she was dating Jack and even went to Mexico with him. I knew this wasn’t true, so I told her friend it wasn't. Right after, Riley switched the story and said she went with an ex-coworker. except that guy had moved to Canada six months earlier. I texted him myself, and he had no idea what I was talking about. He even laughed at the idea. \n\n• I met one of Riley’s other friends outside of work once, and he said, “Oh, I didn’t know you two were close.” Riley immediately changed the subject.\n\n• She’s told me so many assault stories I can’t even count them anymore if I added them up, it would be over a dozen at this point. The timelines never make sense, the details change constantly, and she even forces fake tears when I ask questions that don’t line up.\n\n• She says she keeps moving because of “money issues” but every single photo she shows me is taken in the same exact house.\n\n• She calls herself a “runner” and a fitness freak but refuses to ever go running or to the gym with me.\n\n• She swears she doesn’t use social media, but I’ve seen Instagram and TikTok open on her phone.\n\n• She once told me she had an abortion supposedly to “prove” she understood what I went through (I had one when I was in my early teens). But when I asked about it, she didn’t even know the most basic things about the process, and two days earlier, she had told me she’d never even been with a guy and that she was a lesbian.\nThere’s more, but honestly i can't even remember it all, theres so much. Every time I think I understand what’s going on, she changes the story.\n\nYesterday, Tess (the girl Riley hates) reached out to me. We talked privately because I just needed to understand what was real and what wasn’t. Tess told me she had noticed Riley’s lies long before I did, and that she always wondered what caused our falling out. Everything started to click.\nNow I feel so so so guilty. Riley would lose it if she found out I talked to Tess. She degrades me if I even mention her or Jack’s name. She bosses me around, calls me weak, tells me to “stick up for myself,” but treats me like her \"pet\" (Tess's words). I feel like I can’t breathe around her sometimes, like my life is insignificant. \nThe messed up part is that she’s my only friend, my first best friend. I keep feeling this awful guilt, like I’m betraying her even though I’m finally realizing she’s been manipulating me from the start. I don’t even know who she really is anymore. She even lies about the music she listens to.\nI’m exhausted. I don’t want to lose my only friend, but I also can’t keep pretending this is normal. I just needed to tell someone because this whole thing has made me feel like I’m losing my grip on reality.",

      "selftext": "This is not a post I ever thought I’d write. Not something I thought would happen to me. \n\nI broke up with my now ex in September. Made the mistake of starting to hookup with him last week. This past Saturday we are at brunch and he tells me that he tested negative for STDs. Mind you he had told me that he had slept with one person once since we had broken up. I was confused by this because he said he used protection. Didn’t trust his answer. I’m about to leave to go see one of my favorite artists in concert (he knows this) and I ask if there’s anything else he wants to tell me. \n\nHe asks to sit in my car with me, tells me he cheated in July when we were together. Said it happened once with a chick he met at a concert. He had told me a few weeks ago that he has gone to a sex club. Then told me it was a lie. Then on Saturday says it was the truth that he did sleep with 1 person at the sex club. He says there’s nothing else to tell me that he’s lied about. \n\nFast forward to yesterday. I text him that I think he hasn’t only slept with 2 people since we broke up.  there’s more he’s not telling me. He eventually says there is something he wants to tell me. But he is addressing it in therapy. I push him to just tell me. He tries to ask to tell me in person. I push back and say to tell me over the phone. \n\nI will note one thing- I had a sense that he had cheated on me in July. I has called him, told him this and he reassured me nothing had happened. At this time he hasn’t done or said anything to lead me to believe he had cheated. It was just a gut instinct. \n\nA few hours ago he tells me that in July he slept with a chick it a concert. Goes to Warped Tour in Long Beach. Convinces himself Im going to breakup with him (I don’t even know he had cheated).\n\nHe then tells me he has all this pent up frustration. So he looks for a strip club. Goes there and finds out it’s a brothel. Proceeds to sleep with 3 women, 2 women he takes back to his hotel where he does cocaine with them. Has sex with them. \n\nAlso 2 weeks prior to me ending our relationship, he hired someone to come to his house for sex. He told me all of this to “build trust.” That’s his own words that Im quitting. I have cried, screamed, felt numb. I was in this relationship for almost 2 years. I’ve never in my life been deceived like this before. And the worst part is I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to trust a man again after this.  I won’t ever hookup with him again. His parents don’t know about his sex addiction and I don’t know if he will ever tell him. \n\nI’m in shock, sad, angry, and numb. Worst of all Im mad at myself for staying with him as long as I did while there were so many other problems. I’m glad I know this all now. It solidifies me not having anything to do with him ever again.",

I always needed some fresh air even though I knew it wouldn't have helped. I was disconnected from my own body and it wouldn't go away. I thought I was going crazy and it was the end of my life. I was trying to do anything to keep myself busy - watching funny videos, talking to my friends, walking. Even small distractions could make my day somewhat better.\n\nNow I'm wondering about prisoners - especially those who had mental health struggles even before being imprisoned. Imagine wanting to run, wanting comfort, but having nowhere to go, almost no privacy, and limited access to anything that might help.\n\nI've read some research talks about mental health in prison, but I couldn't find any personal stories. I want to know:\n\nDid these struggles get worse once you were inside?\n\nWhat small things helped you survive to get through the day?\n\nSince I've experienced similar feelings outside, now I cannot thinking about those who are literally trapped while feeling this way. I want to hear every story I can get. Thanks in advance.",

I thought I was doing what I humanely could.  I thought I did try my best with my past romantic prospect too. I was wrong. Over the past few months, I do realize to a certain extent, I have had a weird childhood where I missed out understanding a lot of basic empathy concepts. I guess I never truly realized what it is to care for people 24/7 rather than just showing up every now and then. I know now. Living while caring for others is truly a glorious purpose. It's better than the melancholy of a sombre and dull life of sitting at your desk and wallowing in your misery. The past months have been transformative. I don't help people because I feel a compulsion.  I do because I can finally feel myself in their shoes, feel what they feel. It's not a temporary thing I have been accustomed to, where I lose the feeling and bury it. It stays with me now. I think I've my roommates to thank for this. I probably could write the very moment the realization hit me but it wouldn't be possible without revealing details that might give away their identities. I guess I finally grew up for real. To my friends who stood by me despite me being a difficult person, I owe you more than my life. To whoever is reading this, whenever you can, just pass on some kindness and mean it. ",

      "selftext": "This will not be a regular confession, as this is directed to a specific person. I write this on my bed, late at night while I can't sleep because my thoughts are too busy reminiscing about the past. It might also be a little long as I need to put all my thoughts into words.\n\nSo, here we go.\n\n\nI miss you, you know? I am already 20 years old and it's been almost 3 years since you broke up with me. Most people will think I am too young to have these thoughts, and that I am being dramatic. They are probably right, and in a few years I will end up forgetting, but right now I can't. \n\nEverything was simpler back then, when you had this \"mask\" you talked about a few months ago. I didn't notice you were hiding so much about your true self, and that you felt suffocated by the way I reacted about things you liked but I didn't.\n\nYou know I've never liked parties or alcohol. I am sorry if I made comments that made you feel like you had to lie to me and tell me you didn't like those things either. If you had told me you did, I don't really know if I would've accepted it by the way I was during that time, and I understand why you didn't feel safe telling me those kind of things.\n\nAnd I was clueless, I thought everything was fine, that we were fine. That we watching anime together on voice call, seeing each other once a month since our houses were pretty far and we were teenagers with no money or means to visit more often, that all that was fine. That we would last together long enough to fix those inconvenients as soon as we started working.\n\nThen, that day came, the day you texted me with a single message: \"I don't feel the same way anymore\". And I was confused: The day before you sent me an \"I love you\" before going to bed. You were supposed to be there on my 18th birthday in a few weeks. To me, everything seemed fine.\n\nBut that text changed everything. It really hurt, I wanted to ask you if it was a joke, but I knew it wasn't, because you would never joke about something like that.\n\nOn the end, I didn't want to hold you back. Thought if you wanted to break up you would have a good reason to. So I just texted you back \"It's okay\" and turned my phone off.\n\nI felt empty that day. The daily calls, the flirting, the \"How was your day\" at the end of each cycle. All of that was gone, and I didn't realize how much you had become part of my life.\n\nDays later I finally snapped. That was the first of four times I contacted you after our breakup. I needed to know what happened, what made you decide you no longer wanted me in your life. I called you out about breaking up over text and demanded a call, which I got. That was the day I got your devastating statement \n\n\"There is someone else\".\n\nI hated everything. I didn't ask who he was or exactly what happened, just turned off the phone again and couldn't help but start crying. I was jealous, thinking about you laughing and flirting with another person. I couldn't stand it. But at the end, I told myself that if you were happy, I was too.\n\nThat was just a lie to try and feel better.\n\nI don't remember much more about that time, I was really out of my head with all that happened. Even though I was in college already.\n\nThen there was the second time I contacted you, I was 19. And you messaged me through messenger asking if I was near your house, since someone had told you they saw me looking for you. I didn't really know what you were talking about, I hadn't gone to your house or anywhere near in a long time, and I told you that.\n\nI was hesitating, a part of me wanted to ask how you were. The other wanted to block you and never talk to you again.\n\nBut then you asked about me, and I couldn't help but answer, I was still weak for you.\n\nI told you I wasn't really doing well, neither in college nor in life, as I was really struggling at finding what I wanted to do, or if I was doing things right.\n\nYou, on the other hand, told me you were awesome, that you finally had let off the \"mask\" you were wearing and be yourself. You told me more about the reason for the breakup and how you felt suffocated by my opinions on some matters, and that you were just changing your personality to fit mine. I admit that I wasn't perfect, and I could see most of what you said being true.\n\nThen I took a stupid risk, and asked you about the other person.\n\nWhat was my surprise, and some anger mixed in, when you told me who was the guy you got with after breaking up with me.\n\nWhile we were together, you had told me about this guy, the one you were going with to the gym every week, alone.\n\nI felt insecure about you spending so much time with him. I told you how I felt, but you said I had to trust you, and I did.\n\nThen you told me you developed feelings for him because I was not present, and you could be yourself with him, that his body was better than mine as he went to the gym and you no longer found me attractive.\n\nThat it only took you a week to get over me and go be with him.\n\nThat really fucking stung. I regretted asking.\n\nHowever, you told me something else: That you two had broken up already.\n\nI really hate this period of time. You were telling me how much you had grown as a person, that you had new standards, and that you had been exploring yourself and that your college life was awesome.\n\nMeanwhile, I was stuck in my place, not knowing what to do with my life. I felt awful. I had a little hope that maybe I could be with you again.\n\nThen you started teasing. Sending pictures of you, asking me about outfits. Insinuating that we could be together again.\n\nThis time you had the lead. I wanted to do anything to meet your standards: started doing exercise, attempted to go to parties and tried alcohol for the first time in my life.\n\nBut you really didn't have any intention of we ever being back together, huh.\n\nIt's my fault for not noticing, really. Even for attempting, I would say. I don't remember how we lost contact after this period, but I thought it was over, or at least I wish it was that way.\n\nBecause then, months later, I contacted you again. Silly me, I started making progress in life and becoming more secure, thought maybe I had an opportunity now.\n\nYou know how I finally realized you were playing with me the last time we talked? Because YOU told me. That you were just pissed about your breakup with gym guy, and you were using me to vent. You even said sorry about it, and clarified that nothing could happen between us again. You even told me you found a new boyfriend, an older guy that \"made you feel safe like no one\".\n\nI REALLY should NOT still miss you after all this. One part of me hates your guts. But I don't know why, you keep coming back to my head. Sometimes everything is fine in my life, I found a passion that I want to pursue, gave up on romance (though it's not really something I have control over).\n\nIn my best days, I understand that I don't need a partner to be happy. I spend my days doing things with no pressure. Even though I don't really do much exercise and my figure is not the best, I am comfortable since I do sports and can spend time doing things with friends and family.\n\nThen, why? Why do you keep popping in my head at 2 am every single week, and making me feel like I am missing a part of my soul.\n\nWhy do I miss watching anime with you for hours. Looking at your expressions when something exciting happened on the screen. Talking with you about a thousand different topics and calling each other by nicknames?\n\nThat is NOT YOU anymore. And I know it. The you I know was nothing other than a facade you put on because you loved me.\n\nWhy can I be perfectly fine without you and need you so desperately at the same time?\n\nAm I obsessed?? It's been almost 3 years since we broke up. I can't be missing a teenage love while being a 20 years old. It's pathetic, but here I am, \"talking\" to you. More like venting.\n\nI hate you, really. And I hope I never meet you again. At the same time, I feel terrible every time you appear on my thoughts and I remember you are with someone else. I don't understand myself.\n\nMaybe I am just a bad person who can't stand seeing you happy. I don't know. All I know is that I need to keep going forward and hope I can forget about you in the future.\n\nAt least, in the short term, I think I will be able to sleep now that I took all of this out of my head.",

I’m turning 30 soon and I’ve planned a birthday party event for about 9 people. The last time I ever had a birthday party was probably when I was in lower elementary school. So turning 30, I wanted to plan and do something special and invite friends. I’ll be paying for a duffy boat ride as well as dinner for 9 people which I am happy to be able to do. I’m not financially stable in any means but I’ve been putting money aside for this special day and so I feel fine with paying for the following. I think though, that something hit me when I was talking with some close coworkers and they mentioned how they would never let their friend pay for anything on their own birthday. And ever since that convo, I feel really weird about ordering my own birthday cake for the event, and I’m starting to think I should just not order a cake at all. I wonder if part of me wishes that one of my friends would surprise me with a cake or take care of the birthday cake part? I know this sounds ridiculous but is it weird that I’m buying my own birthday cake? How do most people go about their birthdays with friends when you’re in your late 20s+30s?",

I brushed it off thinking baka friendly lang talaga siya.\n\nPero she constantly chats with my boyfriend, sending selfies, spa day, random updates, kung saan siya kumakain or nagwo-workout. I told him before na it makes me uncomfortable. Hindi ko naman siya pinapapili, I just wanted him to draw the line and be mindful.\n\nThen one time, she visited their office after resigning, and they had lunch alone. He only told me after it happened, tapos nagtanong pa kung pwede niya ihatid si girl. I said, “It’s up to you,” hoping he’d remember how I felt. Pero ginawa pa rin niya.\n\nLater, I found out na nagme-message ulit si girl, sharing her relationship problems sa Instagram DMs, tapos naka disappearing messages pa. I found out kasi I checked his inbox. At first, sabi niya it was about a mutual friend, pero later on, umamin siya na it was actually about her fiancé. He justified it by saying “sensitive topic” daw and he couldn’t tell me. What broke me wasn’t even the topic, it’s that he lied.\n\nRecently, she messaged again asking if they could meet with their old friends. And even though alam niya how I feel about her, he still asked if he could go. Dun ako tuluyang sumabog. I cried so hard that day.\n\nIn that moment, I felt nothing. As in wala. Not even the love I used to feel for him. Just emptiness. Nakakatakot kasi kahit umiiyak na siya, I felt nothing.\n\nHe’s really sorry now. He admits na he was insensitive and that it’s his fault. ",

The other kids? They would stare at me for as long as 15 minutes straight, and meanwhile lose interest and look around the room when I talked to them.\n\nBy 5, I had the instinct of a social butterfly and the vocabulary of a 10 year old. I was befriending everyone in sight and having complex, two-sided conversations with them. Meanwhile a lot of kids would either stand there and stare at me (again, open mouthed) or have very simplistic dialogues like \"I like dat. I want dat. Dat is bad.\" Strangely, this was not autism, as I had plenty of super strong and extroverted friendships with kids of similar intelligence to me (who were also not autistic), and was able to carry lively conversations with adults.\n\nFast forward to age 8 and some of my classmates were still eating open-mouthed. I figured this out, again, at age 2. My classmates were still interrupting, shouting, screaming in public, while again, I learned that this was socially unacceptable at age 2.\n\nFast forward to age 12 and I figured out how academic research / literature review worked and did it on a range of topics just for fun, often presenting my findings to online forums or family members.

      "selftext": "Hi, I (f22) am so lonely. I’m not saying this like \"i’m bored rn\" I’m saying I have always been a backup friend, the backup person and I have always felt not cared about or whatever. I feel like I’m always the last choice and/or never treated right, even by my own family. And I have been drinking lately, a lot more than I used to and even though I don’t drink alcohol to the point that it ruins my life(I don’t drink on work hours and no one has realised that it’s a problem), I consider myself an alcoholic. I drink to escape my own thoughts and usually it works, I usually just dance and listen to music and things like that when drunk, but tonight, it was different, like really different. I cannot stop crying. I don’t know if this post will make any sense either and I am sorry for that.\n\nI think I’ve been depressed for years now, but I’m also a very positive person and I think I have been acting like I’m happy for so long that I have fooled even myself at this point. I can have happy moments, but I feel like I don’t matter to anyone. I have had multiple best friends over the past years, but none that have been there for very long(when people don’t respect me or treat me right, depending on the way they react when I tell them I don’t like the way they’ve acted towards me, I cut them off), recently I got very close to my little sister(I’m also close to my big sister, but not in a tell her everything way), she basically tells me everything and I tell her what happens in my life(which I’m not going to lie is not a lot lately). But she got a boyfriend recently and ever since then we have not talked that much, I have barely talked to her since last thursday. It is tuesday.\n\nAnd recently I really needed the talk I have been having with her because my best friend(I don’t know if I can consider her my best friend anymore) has been acting like she does not care about anything that happens in my life, and it hurts. We don’t really see each other, my work is pretty demanding ane her school is demanding too, we used to see each other every week because we worked together, but I resigned(for a month long trip, best month of the year yet) and even tho we text every day, we have not seen each other since june. Whenever I talk to her about personal stuff like a guy or a girl I’m seeing or talking to, something that happened at work, telling her something about my family or whatever she always answers \"I see\", \"ah\", \"that’s bad\" or \"that’s good\" depending on the situation, but she talks about her life and what happens in her life, so I know she’s not mad at me… I don’t understand why.\n\nI have also not been treated right by my family, at least, I feel like I have not been treated by them. I’m the middle child, I don’t want to say that I get treated like shit, because I don’t get treated like shit, but I do feel like my parents have this \"eh so what\" attitude about me. They’ve cared about me, but more my qbout my grades than me. And when they realised that I didn’t really care that they wanted me to have good grades, they kind of stopped caring if that makes sense? Like I graduated high school in 2020(pandemic style, so I didn’t get a prom, a graduation or anything of the sort) and when we started school online in march of 2020, my parents stopped caring(I was 16 at that time). As long as I was going to class, they didn’t care. When I started college(I was and still am living with them, I think that’s important to know), they did not care that I changed programs, they stopped asking for what grades I would have and just stopped asking about school and barely showed any interest. Also, they don’t really tell me that they’re proyd of me, like ever, I graduated college and we didn’t take any picture, they didn’t care.\n\nWhen I got into university(where I live there’s a step between high school and university and I decided to call it college in this post), they didn’t really care. What they didn’t know is that the pandemic made me somehow loose any motivation in life(I’m saying the pandemic, because I kind of thought that it would become a lot more bigger than it actually got, so I stopped putting effort in school, partially because I thought that in the end it wouldn’t matter but also because I got depressed), so since college I have had barely passing grades, but whem I got into university, the passing grades just became me failing in almost everything. I would make efforts to pass, but I was so stressed and depressed that after two semester of uni I was put on a list that meant if I didn’t get my grades up I would get kicked out. And I didn’t change the way I was doing school, so I got kicked out/dropped out of school, I think at this point I just gave up. I told my family, I told them I dropped out, when I couldn’t do anything at that point. At that point, my parents were disappointed, as they should, I mean having one kid being a nurse(my big sister) and the other drop out, is disappointing. And then I started working.\n\nThe thing is, when I started university, I didn’t get initiated(like hazed but bot in a bad way, if that makes sense), because I got into a small program, so I didn’t have any friends, even when I did try to make friends in my classes it would!mt last very long.\n\nI know this post is all over the place, but basically all I’m saying is that I have always been told that once I get into college and university I would get a lot of friends and opportunities. But all I got was depressed, since everything was online. And now I have one friend, if I can even consider her a friend. My life is so boring I only go to work, train a little, drink(I try to only drink on weekends that way I’m not hungover at work during the week)then go to bed and repeat. I barely talk to anyone, I don’t have to money to go to therapy. Even when I was in relationships, nothing changed(except I got sexually assaulted and/or got treated like shit).\n\nThis is not a cry for help, I am not going to cause any harm to myself or anything, I just don’t know what to do with my life at this point, I feel like nothing I do matters, no one is proud of me and I feel like no one sees me for who I am(I do believe I am a good person, I’m kind, I’m nice, understanding, empathetic, etc) or they take advantage of me.\n\nBasically, I feel like if I didn’t exist, the life of the people atound me would still be the same and they wouldn’t care. I have a plan for what I’m to do with my life, but I feel like no matter what I do, nothing is going to change, and that scarss me, because I don’t want to be like this forever.\n\nI’m sorry if my post is all overthe place, I’m not really used to writing anything. Also english is not my first language, so Imm sorry for the mistakes and everything. If you read this thank you, I appreciate it. And also sorry for the long post.",

      "selftext": "This is a long story, and I'm not sure to who should I tell this since I don't want to be an annoyance to my friends or make my family guilty, so I hopped on to an alt to make this post to vent a little and remain anonnymous of my friends and family, it's not a big tragedy nor any big juicy/funny drama, but it's my life. Also, excuse my poor English this isn't my main language.\n\nEver since I was little, my parents argued, a lot. I don't really recall many events that transcurred during that time, but I recall that those were really tough times, so much so that as a child I contracted Bronchospasm and I even became a bully as a way to vent all my frustrations against others in the form of hate. Massive outbursts of rage and violence weren't uncommon for little me and I got multiple citations by the school administration because of that, luckily I never did anything really bad.\n\nThe main reason of why I was like that was because of how things were at home, at that time, we didn't have a lot of money, so both of my parents were really stressed, my mother sold pillows and blankets through internet, and my dad worked in a pharmacy. They argued a lot, with each other, and with us. And it wasn't pretty, they screamed and insulted at each other, and same for us.\n\nMy dad was a really strict and temperamental man, he snapped really easily, and when scolding, he would always approach to you until he corners you and start screaming and insulting mere centimeters of my face, towering me, feeling his spit on my face while he did so. Also, at first during the first 6 years of my life, not only did he do that, but he also used physical punishments, like spanking, and using a leather belt.\n\nAnd the years went by, luckily at that time I had my big brother at my side, so when my parents started arguing, we would lock ourselves in the bedroom, and he would turn on his pc and start playing a game like the binding of isaac while making funny commentaries which would make me laugh a lot.\n\nNow, I don't recall these next events with 100% fidelity, but I'll try to describe them as best as possible.\n\nEver since around 2015 (I was 10) during some arguments that my parents had with each other, my father would sometimes barge into the bedroom where me and my brother were in, and he would start screaming to my mother that he was leaving, while packing his luggage right there, and I don't even know how my brother reacted at all in those situations, but I remember crying and screaming begging my father to not leave.\n\nUntil early 2017. That time both of my parents had yet another argument where my father packed his luggage while making us watch, but that time my mother actually made him leave.\n\nLater that year my grandmother fell very ill, it sometimes happened once every few years and my mother went there to take care of her, this would eventually lead to my grandmother going to live with me, my brother and my mother.\n\nNot long after, after an argument between my brother and my mother, my brother who I always relied upon finally moved out of the house, going to live at my father's place, which now was the house where my grandmother lived at (he was renting there), and a few months later, my brother eventually moved to his own place.\n\nAnd because of different health necessities that my grandmother had for sleeping, she took the double sized bed that my parents used to sleep at, then my mother couldn't sleep at the living room (it connects to the rest of the house, has 0 privacy and is right next to the bathroom that my grandma needs to use constantly) so she went to sleep at my room and I went to sleep at the living room, essentially losing the only secure and private place I had till this day.\n\nI could add to how difficult it was living with my grandmother, but I won't, because she might've been seriously difficult to deal with, and still is, she's very dependant on an emotional level, very manipulative (faking health issues, saying that she will harm herself so my mother or me have to come running) and pretty often has tantrums like a kid. But I still love her, and I don't want to make this story even longer.\n\nSo after all that, things were already pretty rough, and my life had changed 180° but I'm not finished, during like the middle of 2017, I started visiting my father, and we chatted, and walked a bit, I don't remember very well the details, but what I do remember was the moment where everything got so fucked up. So, my father that day started telling to 12 year old me that he was trying to reconnect with my mother but everything he did was in vail, she always rejected him with anger, and STUPID 12 year old me thought that it would be a great idea to help, so I asked him \"Why not give her some space?\" he did so, and next time that I went to visit him, he said that it worked (nowadays I'm not sure if he was lying) and started treating me not like his son, but in his own words \"like a friend\".\n\nAnd after that, he started telling me EVERYTHING my mother and him talked, from the good, to the bad, to the topics that you would normally find pretty gross to talk with (sex, accusations of cheating).\n\nSo now I knew every argument they had, every insult they said to each other, I even knew that my mother threatened my father with a restriction order, and not only that, but my father was also a really manipulative person, and he was constantly telling me stuff like lies in order of making me be against my mother.\n\nThat year was seriously tough, felt like I lost the family I once thought I had, my perception of both my mother and father completly changed, I lost all my privacy, and I didn't have anyone I could feel like I could count on.\n\nThrough the years, this stuff kept going, problems at home with my mother and grandma, problems outside with my father, I was starting highschool and I didn't even know how things were going to fold out outside of the school, I was already stressed tf out. I even remember asking my father around early 2018 to stop showing me the conversations he had with my mother, and he practically started having a tantrum in the middle of the street, saying that I don't love him, and that he will die alone, I didn't even know how to respond to this, so I went back with what I asked him.\n\nAnd things kept going like this up until 2019, he went back with my mother and they started going out once again (many years later my mother confessed me that it was because of the pressure and that she didn't want him to keep putting me and my brother in the middle of this problem), my father was completly different in front of my mother, pretty gentlemanly, never disagreeing with her, but he kept showing me their conversations and now that he was going out with my mother, he was way colder than before, and less \"friendly\".\n\nAnd things went on during the next years, they were still kinda rough, I was already dealing with lots of stuff from past years, and while yes, things looked like they were calmer, in reality, all the arguments they had with me now started from air, and were really really bad, one day I just couldn't even keep up with it, and while they both were yelling at me, I just ran away from home, I was feeling terrible, I was crying and I was feeling like I was lacking air, and so I walked towards a park close to my house to cry in peace for a while, meanwhile I got some messages from my father saying that I was in the wrong and asked me to come back home so we could talk. I just ignored him and stayed in that bench where I was crying for a while longer, I started texting some friends asking how they were doing, not wanting to show them in what state I was in, but wanting to feel comforted by just talking to them a bit.\n\nUntil I got a message from my brother, where he asked me where I was, I told him, and he called an uber to come take me to his apartment, so I stayed there for 3 days in total, where we talked the situation, and eventually he convinced me to go back home and tell our parents that I was sorry for running away.\n\nTime went on, eventually the pandemic came and I stayed at my mother's place with my grandma while my father stayed at my grandma's old apartment. The years eventually passed by as notmal, with the same stuff as the years before, but a little toned down.\n\nUntil at the end of 2023, a few weeks before christmas, my mother cut out my father for good, at that time I was already at university and working, so my father told me what happened one day I was leaving of work, at that time I felt so fed up with that shit, that I cut him off, apologized because I knew that it was a stong topic, and asked him to just stop narrating me all his arguments with my mother, he got really angry, and had a similar moment like in 2018 where he said that I do not care for him and that he will die alone, etc.\n\nI spent christmas and new years with my mother and grandma, I just didn't want to go see him at that time, I was actually really fed up with what he wanted to tell me. \n\nA few weeks later I decided to start visiting him, mostly to check on him, have a chat with him, and see what he's doing, at the end of the day, I still love him beucase he's my father, despite him acting so much like a fucker.\n\nAnd so I spent like a year visiting almost every weekend, sometimes we went to drink a coffee, sometimes we went out to eat something, or we went to the cinema, or we just stayed home, I even spent 2024's christmas and new year with him.\n\nBut he never truly changed, not only did he keep telling me everything he argued with my mother via chat, he also started acting like a poor victim that will die alone and as if my mother was so evil, when she started dating someone else, he did some kind of reverse search or something using his photos from my mother's instagram stories to try and find some info on that guy. He moved right in front of my mother's workplace. He even tried to make me believe that my mother was having an affair prior to her cutting him off. During one of the first months, he even told me that he wanted to kill himself. And if I didn't went to check on him for a couple of consecutive weeks he got super mad, saying that if something were to happen to him I wouldn't know until it was too late.\n\nThings got out of control at June 15 of this year, this is the last time I had a direct contact with him, I once again didn't visit him for like 3 weeks because I had exams (and also I didn't enjoy spending time with him anymore), and when I came back, he went back to try and guilt trip me saying that I do not love him, if something were to happen to him I wouldn't even notice, etc. That day I lost my cool, had a real argument with him in years and never came back after that.\n\n\n\nAnd that's the backstory, nowadays I try to live my life as cheerfully as possible, distracting myself with videogames, music, going out with friends, making bad jokes and laughting at them, etc.\n\nBut sometimes, when I'm not doing any of that, I can't help but remember all the stuff that happened in the past and feel really depressed and sad, or remember how I turned my back against my own father and feel really guilty, sometimes waking up from the bed is really hard, and thoughts of self harming or more are not infrequent, but still, I wouldn't do that, maybe it's just caused becuase I normally don't sleep enough but still. \n\nI feel like my life is going nowhere, and there's stuff that I want to do, like developing my own games, but as soon as I go in front of my pc I lose all motivation.\n\nAnd I feel that thanks to all the shit that happened before, talking face to face with other people it's harder than ever before, I feel way more shy than I ever was.",

I matured and realized that stealing as a concept is foul, regardless if these corporations are not losing money out of it. And that some of these stores that I was stealing from are owned by regular, most of the times great, people, and not *directly* by the company.\nRight now, I want to go and pay back to these stores for the things I took, but I'm ashamed, and also afraid they might press charges against me, or be able to use this against me in any way. \nI should also note that I'm using a wheelchair, so they might have noticed me doing this in the past and felt sorry for me and ignored it.

      "selftext": "Hi reddit, this is my first ever post so please be kind. \n\nI (19f) have been feeling so dissociated from my life lately. I am in my second year of university, doing what I thought I wanted, but now I feel like I’m stuck and have no idea how to fix it. \n\nI am on track to become an English teacher. I love English, I love everything about it. I love reading books, poetry, plays, and writing all of them too. I never was sure about teaching. I only picked it because my family said I would be good at it. But I’ve always truly wanted to do more. \n\nI feel so cringe and embarrassing for saying this, but hey, that’s what Reddit is for. I want to act, do musical theatre, comedy, literally anything to do with the arts. I’ve always wanted that. It’s been in my life in little ways since I was a child. Every time there was a commercial break on tv, the living room would become my stage. I would make my parents and siblings watch me dance, sing, or act my heart out. I’ve played guitar since I was a kid, I did drama in high school, a few plays in elementary school, but that’s as far as I ever got. I also have written multiple short stories, poems, and attempts at novels since I was 12, but I was never taken seriously by my friends or family, and to be honest, I didn’t even take myself seriously. \n\nMy mom was supportive when I was younger, she would post videos of me singing on Facebook claiming that it would get me on Ellen lol. But once I got older, this passion got buried away. I only re discovered my love for the arts recently. There has been a lot of issues going on at home and I’ve found my only escape to be watching comedians on youtube. I have consumed more comedic media in the past 4 months than I have in my entire life. This has now spilled into musical theatre, which I have always loved but never truly appreciated. I’ve also discovered a new interest in improv, which I was always scared of but now desperately want to do. Now, the only thing I can think about is how I want to be doing that. I want to be on stage somehow. Not for the fame, I couldn’t give a shit about that, but for the love of what I’d be doing. \n\nI truly feel like I could do it too. I know I’m funny, not to sound like an asshole or anything, but that is my one quality I am confident on. I can kind of sing, but I know I could improve. I can play a musical instrument. I can act, but of course I need to improve on that as well. I’m a good writer, I’m an English major so I sort of have to be lol. I have all the basic fundamental skills needed I just need a place to work on them. I don’t want to sound like some dumb kid that is just fantasizing about some make believe life, but that is how I feel whenever I talk about this. \n\nI can’t abandon my life I’ve been building for myself, I am supposed to be a teacher. I have mentioned auditioning for a play to my mom in the past few weeks, and I got a laugh. I know I would eventually be supported if I wanted to just do a little something like that on the side, but I want this to be my life. If it were up to me I’d drop out of uni, move to the city, and go to theatre school. But life isn’t that easy. I don’t have the money for that, I can’t leave my mom, and what are the odds of it actually happening? I’m the type of person who makes a big declaration like this, and then never does anything about it. This feels different though, I have never wanted something this deeply in my life. I feel like if I don’t do something about it soon then I’ll regret it. It feels like my life is slipping away from me and I need to gain some control. I’m only 19 years old but somehow it’s stuck in my brain that I’m too late. \n\nSo Reddit, I wasn’t originally going to ask for advice but if anyone wants to drop some anecdotes, please do. I just hate what I’ve been feeling lately. ",

      "selftext": "I do apologize for the overly long post. I need an outlet where my own friends or relatives might feel this is too heavy and negative a topic. I will delete this in maybe… 48hrs. Also, excuse my language beforehand.\n\nGrandparents are awful. They may be “nice”now since they’re old and frail but it doesn’t take away the disdain I have for them. What’s worse is that they have to live with us because grandma has Dementia.\n\nMy grandma is a vile person. She’s spoken ill of my dad back then when he was dating my mom. Even now while she’s old but it’s more “tame.” IMO, I think it’s a combination of him not finishing college and being a stay-at-home dad while mom is the main earner. He did have a job before but he gave it up to take care of us-his kids- years ago. Then, to hear grandma tell me bits like this in conversation upset me that I made her stop. Actually kinda shed a tear for my dad before falling asleep one night. As much as I have my own issues with him- looking at him as he is now and thinking about the stuff about him then, hurts and angers me. Previous years (around 2010s), there was a misunderstanding with my dad and grandpa that my oldest brother intervened. In doing so, it upset both grandparents that grandma wanted grandpa to hit my brother. Even going so far as including our uncle to jump him 2v1. Now that grandma’s more old, living with us and having to deal with her Dementia- it’s more draining. She causes problems everywhere she goes. Clogged toilets. Wasted food. Trash. Hoarding. Contamination concerns. Unreasonable demands. Forgetting. Looping. SO MUCH water. SO much tissue. Lying and deflection. Having to make accommodations FOR HER on the daily, especially since she’s got issues with: heart, eyes, mobility, T2D… now her brain. *I know some of the stuff is associated with Dementia and have already checked the subreddit about it for tips when I face certain problems.\n\nGrandpa is just as bad as grandma. He abandons her at our house when he leaves to work 3-4x/week  (83y/o, his choice). So, he doesn’t see what we put up with and denies that X problem never happened. But when he does come back, there’s frequent arguments between them. I hear the yelling, frustration, and swearing despite closed doors. This in turn makes grandma more difficult in behavior. I’ve seen her ugly side with me a good few times. It’s nothing new but I can’t help but get mad and need space to avoid her for my own peace. Oh yeah, you know that misunderstanding with my dad? It was about our tv before. Parents forgot to change HDMI to regular tv channel after watching a movie. Grandpa wanted to watch one day so he turned it on but since it was in HDMI he didn’t know what to do. He ASSUMED that my dad didn’t want him to watch television and made it very personal that he wanted a fight. And while he’s the “smarter” one compared to grandma… he gambles too. To the point that he still owes my mom about $2000 and is shameless to ask because he “promises” my mom, “I’ll pay it back once my check comes in!”(This was a few months ago) Mom gets upset but she can’t really say No because it’s her dad and the past“sacrifices” he made (as a sailor). It’s guilt-tripping and I HATE it.\n\nMy uncle- mom’s older brother. Money issues too. For some reason, I guess my aunt suddenly wanted to be all bougie and was giving attitude about it to uncle. Uncle asked my mom for some money. She gave ~$1k USD a few months ago. How much it translates to Philippine pesos, idk. NOW, he’s asking for more. Apparently for a restaurant(?). Not sure but it’s not an investment I personally want my mom to get involved with. They own a little shop but now it’s not doing well. But i feel like my mom might have to give if her own parents pressure her too much. Mind you, my uncle has 2 kids doing well- 1 living in another country with his family, the other is a realtor along with their spouse.\n\nOther uncle- mom’s younger brother. Has asked for money from my mom too but for his existing business. It does well. But the main problems stemmed from the relationship with our aunt/his wife. She cheated on him some months back. I learned this was not the first time either but he forgave her anyway. This last one, my uncle and his son, in anger, almost went physical with the guy. After learning and seeing evidence, they kicked aunt out the house for some time. Their own family heavily affected. Their youngest child kept crying for their mom for days. Then, somehow… after time and supposed talking, they let her come back. It was one day that I overheard my aunt crying to grandma on the phone of what my uncle was doing/did to her, triggered me. She was mentioning 🍇-like behavior from him, even when she would say she’s not in the mood. Aunt and uncle went to a doctor to tell uncle that what he was doing was hurting her. When my mom learned this, i think she came into the conclusion that it was mental illness. Out of loyalty to her brother/family. When she opened this up to me, I found myself starting to hyperventilate (let’s just say I know the feeling). I had to tell her not to excuse uncle’s horrid behavior and actions for that. There are people struggling with mental illness who would never. They’d have to have some sort of deviancy or something. I personally think my uncle disregarded what the doctor said to hurt aunt. Oh… and my grandma’s response after learning about it all? “[Aunt’s name]… you better take care of my son, okay?” Effing Heck. Dementia-afflicted or not, worst response ever. While Grandma cried learning about the situation, it sounded like it was more for her own son (he’s the favorite among the 3). Yes, what my aunt did was horrible but i think my uncle is worse.\n\n*Btw, my mom is not a complete pushover. She’s can be stubborn and she’s also fierce. But her family makes it complicated. I am no good person either. Saying all this. Heck, I’ve lost it with my grandma at times that I’ve had to fix my tone more than once.\n\nOKAY. I’m done yapping. I just wanted to get this lingering anger out. Sorry again. Will delete this after some time.",

      "selftext": "This is something I want to get off my chest, because I just realized something about myself. \n\nAbout 4 months ago, my stepfather ended up losing his leg to diabetes. This happened after a year straight of not taking insulin, and instead depending on homeopathic teas and crystals to mitigate the effects of diabetes (Yes, I am being serious). \n\nMy stepfather married my mother when I was around 7 years old, and since then he's been a pest in my life. When I was younger and my youngest sister was just born, he was extremely abusive to me and my mother. He would verbally, physically, and psychologically abuse her, and sexually harass me by pulling my pants down and poking at my ass for fun. For much of my childhood, I felt so much emasculation. I dreamed of being big enough to take him on and to avenge me and my mom.\n\nDuring my freshman year of college, I had started working out a lot, and put on a lot of muscle. I had this fantasy, I don't know why, of returning home over winter break, and finally beating the shit out of him to get revenge for all the years of misery he put me, my mother, and my sisters through. It was some type of masculine power fantasy that I was hoping to live out. I had the plan in my head, I would track him down to the gas station where he usually gambles at, confront him, and then just beat him up. One random sunday, I almost went through with the plan, I went to the place he frequented, and went up to him. However, he didn't seem the same as whenever I was a kid, when he was a terrifying figure in my household. He was older, shorter, fatter, balder, and almost looked sickly. When I realized how miserable and embarrassing he looked, I just had to abandon what I wanted to do. I just felt too much pity. \n\nEven though I didn't go with the plan then, it still lingered in my mind. Every time I saw him, I just filled with rage and scenarios played out in my head where I got some type of justice for all the abuse. I felt these fantasies play throughout my head up until about 4 months ago, when he almost died from diabetes. \n\nI don't know what psychologically happened to me, but I guess with him losing his leg, and almost dying, my heart felt some type of justice? I can't say. He's always been such a lurking figure over my life, even after I had become an adult and was out of my mom's house, still stories of his drinking, gambling, and verbal abuse still came to me through texts from my family members. Now he just doesn't appear in my mind, and those flashes of anger that I used to get when I remember something from my childhood are gone. He's just, gone.\n\nI don't know what to say, but I'm happy.\n",

He was put down not even an hour after we went to the vet.\n\nThe moment we found out he had to be put down, I've been holding everyone together.\n\nI had to stop crying because my mom stopped breathing, talking to the vet at the same time as she talked to me about the bill for the euthanasia and cremation. I had to talk to my older sister on the phone about what happened because everyone else was crying, and holding the phone on video call so she could see him one last time. I was hugging and comforting and helping everyone in my family to breathe and to mourn.\n\nWe decided to bury him instead, and I could barely get out of the car. But I still had to take out the trash, clean up, take out my dog, and help my older sister process the death through the phone. I was the one who made paw print clay pieces with his fur so we'd have something to have from him. Every time someone cried, took care of it. I took pictures and videos of him before he was buried.\n\nEvery night my mom has made me sit in her room until she falls asleep. If i try to leave she gets angry at me and calls me selfish. Shes done it every night since his passing.\n\nShe hugged me only because she told me she wanted me to comfort her. She's religious and im not, and the way she talks about him sometimes makes me uncomfortable. But I sit and listen because I know shes mourning too.\n\nIm in her room right now, sitting and waiting until I can leave. And she wouldn't stop talking about him.\n\nShe kept talking about how she had vision and dreams about his death and knew it was coming. And telling me that now something was going to happen to the rest of my pets. She asked if she would get over it, if he was lonely in the ground, if he was cold, and she wouldn't listen to my advice. I just wanted her to sleep.\n\nAnd then I told her to stop stressing herself out right before bed, she kept saying that she has nothing else to think about and that I didnt care about her or love her. And I just couldnt take it anymore and told her to sleep.\n\nAnd she's sleeping now, and im so overwhelmed. I want to leave, but im scared to get up. No one hugged me really or asked if I was okay. They didnt even look at me. And im stuck, without my cat, caring for people who dont love me.",

      "title": "I feel like my gender transition ruined any chance I have of a stable, healthy romantic relationship and my abusive past is haunting me.",
      "selftext": "Among other financial & social issues I’ve faced (the ongoing fight against homelessness, hateful words etc) it feels like I’m going to always be alone or abused because of who I am.\n\nI feel inherently vulnerable. I’ve dated one man, and another trans woman long term, both were incredibly abusive & one-sided. My last attempt to be with a man resulted in me being raped which has taken a while to heal fully from, which has left me solely interested in other women.\n\nIt feels like I’m the only emotionally available person in the world, maybe because it’s the south, but loneliness is killing me sometimes. I can be happy alone, but I feel so unfulfilled & without purpose. I have those stupid white bread dreams of a good job, wife, kids, all that American Dream stuff, and it feels like transitioning pushed it further out of my reach.\n\nYoung people haven’t figured out who they are or what they want. Old people want fun & games. I’m stuck in the middle. I feel too old fashioned. Online dating is a cesspool of heartache & unwanted dick pics and Third Places are dead here.\n\nA friend of mine dated me for a week before she realized she wasn’t ready emotionally to date again after her own past trauma. Then messaged me a few weeks later to say she never actually had a connection to me to even be friends when she pushed for everything.\n\nI tried dating another trans woman, who is one of the most emotionally immature & hurtful people I’ve ever met, and intentionally concealed it from me.\n\nAll the men want to use me for my body it seems, and I’m not into them anyway. God, the cis gay men here love to put me down for being a “confused man”.\n\nThe few single trans women here are all severely emotionally damaged and tend to physically/emotionally/financially abuse or abandon me (Recently a longterm platonic friend propositioned me and after I said no, she said never actually clicked with me & was just friends out of desperation for companionship.)\n\nThe cis women keep giving me the backhanded compliment that I’m so sweet, so caring, so smart, so helpful “If only I was a guy I’d be perfect for them”, and if there’s any cis Lesbians around here, not like I have any clue how to find or talk to them.\n\nIt’s left me feeling utterly frustrated. So I continue to practice self-love. I get therapy for my bad experiences with my relationships & my childhood. I search for better work to help with my terrible financial strife. I hang out with my friends. I play games. I continue on.\n\nBut my god, I want something real. Something meaningful, trusted. I miss holding a woman in my arms at night, the safety & security I felt. So motivated I could take on the world. The butterflies in my stomach, the sense of contentment I felt just being with a girl. I miss it, so much. I hate the south.\n\nI may be homeless at the end of the month, can’t keep up the payments. Even if I can’t I’ll still be here. Surviving, and hoping one day to find someone who’ll love me.\n\nMy friends all say, always say how great I am. How I hold them together, How kind, and helpful, and wonderful I am.\n\nThey don’t understand I’m falling apart. That I cry at night from loneliness. That I use humor, and what they think is a charming attitude, to delude myself into thinking my life isn’t as shit as really is. A few people have noticed, when I make a joke to someone, or flirt with a woman, or do something to make someone else’s day, that there’s pain in my eyes. Everyone tells me how strong I am while I feel as weak as I ever have. Before my problems were out of my control, my dad & other abusers. Now? It’s all my fault.",

      "selftext": "\nPosted on a throwaway account since I'd be screwed if this was found..\n\nAs the title says, the voices/urges in my head are getting worse than ever. They keep degrading me, pumping me full of rage and despiar. Feelings of hatred cruise inside of me. And worse, they make me want to hurt myself but mostly others. They make me want to kill people. The people who have wronged me.\n\nI can't help it. I have no real coping mechanism or even a way to vent. I don't have people in my life that I can trust to even vent a SFW version of this. I try to play video games and all it does is simply feel like I'm staring at a void with the thoughts occasionally surfing through my head, and sometimes it just feels pointless playing so I put the controller down and stop. I can't trust my parents with this info since my sister is already on meds and has been taken out of school for anxiety attacks in the past so they have already told me they don't wanna deal with two fucked up kids. Poor me..\n\nI feel like a disappoitment since I can't imagine what my drill sergeants would say to me if they saw me now. I tried so hard to make them proud and I think I did but the amount of shit I've gotten myself into is fucked.\n\nI hate myself and my existence. Why did I have to grow up to be 5'4. No fucking girl is ever going to want that and even worse is that if I ever do have kids with a woman, they'd be just like me, all full of resentment towards my parents for making me so short and wondering why I exist. Just for that, I'm denying my parents the right to have grandchildren. FUCK THAT\n\nRecently my friends caught me off. The ones that I would commute with to school. One of them was a constant downer, and a fucking school shooter viber that was pretty creepy when it came to his radical right wing beliefs. Something tells me his last fuck you to me was transferring his bad energy onto me. I've been stalking those 3 motherfuckers and have been planting small signs that I'm watching them, in a bid to fuck with them. Whether it's political symbols that make them furious, or whatnot, I want them to suffer, to feel the same rage I felt.\n\nI can't trust my other friends either. Their lives are too perfect or they're just plain fucking dumb to try to understand this. \n\nAfter all those miserable 22 weeks of Infantry OSUT and reporting a child predator at work in my civilian job, what is my reward at the end of all this. Losing friends, still not having a girlfriend because every girl I talk to always has a confirmed boyfriend or straight up doesn't like me and also getting sued by the child predator and I may lose my job at the same time for setting him off. \n\nIts not like I'm terrible at talking with women or people, I just have bad luck. I want to kill myself but then I realize that would be too easy, my enemies would win and revel in my death and I can't let that happen. I've lost the urge to even have a crush on someone. Stuff like butterflies in my stomach and stuttering while talking to them is a thing of the past. Smiling is harder because what's the point. The only thrill and dopamine burst I get is by fucking with my ex friends or that child predator. I've never kissed or even held a girl's hand and by this point, I've stopped caring about getting into a relationship if it'll keep ending with me gettinf hurt, betrayed or just result in me finding out yet again that they're taken/not interested. It's been nearly 3 years since I asked out a girl in person as every other time, I've had to resort to online simply because the universe forbid me from meeting them in person to ask the question. Last time I did ask out a girl in Feburary 2024, I didn't even get the words out before being told \"no thanks\" in a weirded out tone. Last rejection was in May 2024 and by this point I don't even have the luxury of getting rejected anymore.\n\nOtherwise, I hate existing, I want to kill myself, I hate myself, my life and I hate everyone that has wronged me. Normally I wouldn't care but even the slighest infraction is pissing me off because the voices tell me to hate that person. I don't even scream or throw shit, I just keep it all bottled in, waiting for the moment to explode. I fucking hate everything..",

      "selftext": "My first arranged marriage met this fate after 7 years. We had a son from that marriage, and I was awarded the primary custody on grounds on being the more involved parent. His mother changed cities and got re-married. \n\nI decided to give this marriage thing another shot. I am from a culture that heavily relies on parents for the matchmaking process. My mother found me a girl- we met once and we chatted for a few months while I was in the US and she was back home. With my busy work schedule and being a full time dad, I really didnt have time to focus on this task myself. My mother passed away a few months after introducing us in 2021. We felt there was some thing we could build on. It was going to be a 2nd marriage for the both of us. Except for the one time when we met, we didnt spend much time together until we got married, in 2021. My son was 8 then. \n\nAs a child I had been sexually molested many a times which made being intimate with my partner always an issue. I told her this before we got married, so she can make an informed decision, and I also told her mom as well, as I knew that even though I can do without it, it might be a deal-breaker for them. It wasn't at that time. \n\nWe got married. Things were nice at first- getting to know each other- learning the likes and dislikes and the honey moon phase. Soon our differences settled in. We had issues in the bedroom, which after several repeated tries, I was able to overcome for the most part. I wouldn't necessarily enjoy it but I knew it was a requirement, so I went with it. We wanted a family and felt that a family would bring about a good change. She could work, but she decided she didnt want to- she wanted a job that met her requirements/timing and being in a small town at that time in the rural US, it was hard for her to find a job of her liking. I assumed that being home, she would pick up the house work and help with my son. It was a constant struggle. My son was my responsibility and I had lived by self so I kept picking up the slack, while working full time and providing for every one. Many a times I explained to her that I expect her to at least have the house in a running order now that she is at home- but it was always met with a half-hearted effort. I could come back from home and house was unkept or my sons room could use a brush up and these things didnt seem to bother her- but bothered me. I always had the house cleaned, organized, packed- and I felt she wasn't doing quite the job I was. She came from a different background and upbringing and I had come from more simpler and humbler background. We were always taught by our parents to be self sufficient and she I felt always relied on others to do chores. I would show her how to do stuff- but she said shes grown and doesnt need to learn. I never felt entitled to much, yet I found her to be high maintenance and more entitled according to my standards. She wanted a BMW once we decided to change vehicles- which is a great car but who can afford the maintenance, expensive clothes, designer bags. I could afford these things thanks to my work, but always felt pressured to do more than I was and on a single income had to be careful. I told her its best if we invest and buy a house first before spending so much money on items that arent even worth it. She would spend 6-7 hours daily on social media and I have no social media accounts. I felt it was a waste of time- she didnt. I can understand that. When we would take a vacation- I would do the best I could to plan and put every thing together- but if she didnt like the hotel or airbnb I booked- not that it was unsafe or dirty- she would refuse to stay there and I had to make changes then and there. If I was spending more time with my son on the vacation, showing him around and giving him a history lesson, she would get mad at me for ignoring her. \n\nUnfortunately, we met with infertility two years after trying naturally and seeing the doctors- she couldnt conceive and of course it put stress on our marriage. Doctors said keep trying naturally- if its going to happen- it may. We tried IVF x2- both failed. Doctors said more wouldn't help. She kept asking to try naturally every other day and for me that was difficult. \n\nIf I was interacting cordially with his mother or his grand parents- she would not approve of that. I told her that I need to teach my son kindness and respect, to which she would reply what about her likes and dislikes. I couldnt maneuver being roles of a father and her husband as well as I could have. The final straw were two incidents back to back. My son's grandfather (uncle) came to pick him up from my brothers house. My dad had been ill and uncle wanted to come say hi and meet him. I asked my brother the permission to invite him in- since it was his house. He came in, met my dad, offered his kind words and picked up my son and left after a 15 min stay. My wife threw a fit about how could I do this without her permission and what her parents would think of this. She gave me so much trouble, that she doesnt have to support me and even showed me that CHATGPT supported her decision for not supporting me. I couldnt believe it that we are asking AI for advice. We made up, moved on. 2 weeks pass by and we are taking a vacation in Caribbeans. She didnt like the Airbnb I had booked- it had mosquitos. She got upset and I had to spend 4 hours trying to wrestle with airbnb for a refund/a new place. I told her that one has to learn to be flexible and to live in all situations- she said she doesnt understand why she has to be the one to learn something in all situations. \n\nShe went to her sisters this past weekend. We chatted and it was a constant back and forth about whos right and whos wrong- and I felt I was done. I told her who I am and who I want to be doesnt align with who she is and who she wants to be and vice versa- its best that we divorce. She said okay. And there you have it folks- my second divorce is coming up. \n\nI have to break this news to my son when he comes back- I hope I can offer him a good childhood-hes 12 now and my biggest worry. \n\nThanks for reading. \n\n",

      "selftext": "My mom is the typical suburban resident of a  large American city and though she never says it directly, she can’t stand the fact that I’ve chosen not to live the same life as her. I live in a small town because the things I love (gardening, hiking, nature, clear air, not sitting in traffic, knowing my neighbors, charming architecture, etc) are nonexistent where she lives (suburbia: giant parking lots, cookie cutter homes and gated communities), and I love it here. But she is constantly making comments throwing subtle shade on my choices and can’t seem to wrap her head around why I wouldn’t want to live the same life she does.\n\nWhen I tell me mom why I like it where I live, she says “you can get that here” and I say “yeah sure, if you’ve got $5M to spend”, to which she always replies that I should just buy a little condo and “work my way up the market” which drives me crazy because even if that was a thing I wanted to do (it’s not), she’s basically telling me I should compromise on what I want so that she doesn’t have to, and it’s especially maddening because she herself never had to make that compromise because of course her $2M house was like $75k when she bought it. I always jokingly say okay, I’ll buy the condo, you live in it, and I’ll live in your house, which she doesn’t seem to find very funny.\n\nShe also doesn’t seem to understand why I would possibly pick a small, beautiful quaint town when I could just drive till I qualify and buy a shitty house in the middle of nowhere closer to where she lives. And all this despite the fact that my mom herself moved across the country when she left her parents’ house and never moved back!\n\nIt all just feels so selfish to me.",

      "selftext": "i 25m was terrible with her. like genuinely. somehow in the end we were still caring about each others presence. anyways. i was absent, insecure, manipulative, emotional, bitter, barely made plans or dates mostly just wanted sex. somehow that worked for years. cheated in different ways, left her multiple times then got back. lied constantly didn’t take care of myself or my hobbies or mental health.\n\nleft the country a few times even traveled with another girl i cheated with in bali. i really left to study abroad to kind of escape my life back home. i started to get fat and depressed but i didn’t like work out or know what to do. i sort of freaked out and thought a new beginning would be great. when she asked to stay with me i cried and said no and i don’t know i came up with some reasons why and quickly started to feel horrible once the loss set in. i convinced her to get back with me. i started to feel unhappy again quickly and wasn’t super motivated.\n\neventually i started to spend a lot of my money and attention on strippers and hookers while still with her. flirted with others, lied to her about it. lovebombed then devalued her. acted nice so she wouldn’t be too mad but deep down had no future plans. don’t even know if i ever really wanted to be with her. i eventually saw her again and was in therapy at the same time and she tried to show me that she wants to love me but a part of me was convinced our relationship was unhealthy and so should end. i tried to end but we fell back into each other. she also begged me a lot.\n\ni’m not confident, lost my job, think i have cptsd, dissociate, stutter, hard to have real friendships. lonely, don’t exercise. most people in my life are just me venting or getting support.\n\nwhile traveling i didn’t take her anywhere meaningful. felt like everything was “normal” at the time. but constantly felt like i was lying and terrified of abandonment. dissociated these feelings away completely. have been fixated on my poor mental health in the years since. we used to have a lovely relationship at the very beginning. she was my closest friend i see her in my mind everywhere these days. she wanted me to get better. she saw the real me but i buried him for some reason unknowingly. now i see it. i’ve buried my ability to love and receive intimacy. i am numb around everyone. i suffer from panic attacks and misery and i don’t know how to take care of myself. im afraid i will have no one when my parents die and even then how i will make money when i am almost completely dysregulated. life was actually pretty good one year ago. since coming to thailand it slowly became my very own hell. not to mention the feelings of wishing i could love her, regretting and feeling confused, as if i forgot that i cared about her until now. that’s how much i blocked my love for her mentally i guess and now missing her. realizing i could be married or have a family. and she feels like my only out. even then i know how crushing the guilt is inside me. it’s like i never ended the relationship i just left for a time and ive accumulated even more things to separate us. \n\neverything is a constant reminder or comparison. i tried to get back with her but what i didn’t do i guess was sit down with her and really try to honestly repair. i grew so sick of how i mentally felt and i used to think it was the relationship to blame. this was before a lot of the nonsense. i started to dissociate and it made me lose my mind. like there was an itch i couldn’t scratch and it kept clawing at me. i didn’t have it before i started dating her. maybe that was a sign i needed to be more honest. that was years ago i never caught the sign.\n\ni really wanted closeness but when she tried to be close it scared me. at the end after another room i blamed my incoming depression on the relationship and left her again. not to mention i became so distant. then i moved to thailand for some reason, which happens to be the place she wanted to move to with me to get engaged. actually i am in pain and delusional enough that i was going to come back home and try to get back with her. i mean genuinely nothing in life brings me joy anymore.\n\ni didn’t even think seriously about how she wanted to be engaged in thailand i just wanted to escape. i won’t say she enabled my emotional outbursts but i felt comfortable in a way being so fucking infantilized with her. it’s like i felt real there. at the beginning i did try to repair and love her better but slowly i must have grown tired of the dynamic i was in and started to hope for better control over my life. i sort of felt like i was with her just because. we fell in love fast i thought we would make it for a long time. i guess we did. and she actually knew a lot of this that im talking about but in my limited stream of consciousness mind i still just discarded. actually she forgave me for a lot and still wanted marriage. but sure she was probably also very trauma bonded to me. i lacked empathy and i used to feel like it was all okay. i was very alone but fantasized about the great life i will live. somehow none of this came to mind when i moved around. or if it did i figured it was in the past somehow. i wasnt parented or guided very well. i was afraid to commit nonetheless and believed if i could only overcome this abandonment would i have then i would go back to being in good shape mentally because that was my belief for years. that it was me staying in the relationship for so long and avoiding abandonment that was making me suffer and lose on my potential. that was my mindset yes. \n\nnow i’m 25 broke depressed suicidal. she has a new boyfriend, they went to germany together. we used to get along but i mirrored her a lot just to feel close otherwise i feel empty. body feels like it’s shutting down.\n\ni know i caused this. full of regret and shame. don’t even know who i am. don’t know how to live with what i did or start fixing myself.\n\ntl;dr cheated lied neglected ex multiple times she loved me i ruined it now alone broke suicidal trying to live with guilt and emptiness\n\nedit: added more context",

      "title": "Moving out of my abusive household and telling my parents 5 days before the departure.",
      "selftext": "Hi. It's my first time creating a post like this. I am posting on an alt account. So right now I (21F) am moving away from my parents. I haven't told them yet because I know the things will hit the fan if I tell them. It all started at night a week ago when I told my fiance(27M) that the country and home I am staying is killing me from the inside. All of my social and other aspects of life is in my own home country. Now a little bit of my backstory.\n\nI live with a mother that used to make me a little copy of her. If I didn't fit into what she thought of me. She would scream and be angry. But she would praise me if I fit in her little form and buy me things. My father wasn't really around because he was out of the country or home as a truck driver but I remember when he came he used to only see how I am failing at class not who I am. My father landed a job at the country I currently reside in. My mother also worked as a cashier and most of the times my grandparents took care of me... to the point I see my grandparents as my parental figures not my parents as I healed from some things. They are not perfect but they shouldn't take care of not their kids as it was thrown into them as they moved in with us. My mother hid my autism diagnosis for 5 years in front of my grandparents and I think because of that they thought I was spoiled(My grandparents are pretty understanding when you explain it to them). But for years I took responsibility for my mother's emotions as her \"friend\".\n\nSo when I was 16 we moved to another country. Before we moved there like a few months I vaguely remember my mother crying to me that she misses my father so much...that she can't handle it anymore. So when my father asked me if I wanted to be here I agreed without much thought in my mind other than making my family happy and whole again. \n\nIn those 5 years I was often treated like I wasn't the member of the house. After I was 17 They barely bought me any clothing or care products that I needed. And I don't mean some expensive creams or something. I mean basics like shampoo that didn't make my head itch. While they bought a new car, new furniture or clothes for themselves. When I stopped being fake nice to them when they treated me badly they pinned it on my ex-friends(I will not get into details on that one but it helped me open my eyes a little on how my parents treated me). My parents often talked to me about things and told me \"my opinion matters\" but when I disagreed they would be angry,scream at me,be passive agressive and do it anyways.\n\nWhen I became 20 and lived in the house with them. They wanted to take my adopted brother(34 M) into the house back. I only knew him when I was maybe 7 and seen him a few times when I was a teen. But I remember that he was a very shady person. I disagreed and told them it's a bad idea and I was concerned about their safety (financial/physical etc). But my mother told me that he is good in his job and they want to start a bussines with him and I should stop crying so loud because it's 2 AM and she goes to work tomorrow. Yes I was crying because I was afraid he will put them at harm because I knew he is that type of person. \n\nIn a nutshell. I was right because my adoptive brother didn't take care of his dog,took drugs,put my father in harm in the day of moving stuff because he stole the car from his job and didn't show up for 3 days.\n\nMy parents swore he is out of the house and they are done with him but I saw how my mother went quickly from f-him mode to \"oooh you poor thing\". And they took him back. Yes. He messed up again when my parents left the house to visit my grandparents because he left his dog in a hot garage. we got the dog out with my fiance as he was visiting while my parents were gone. And they finally kicked him out.\n\nI noticed he washed the dog's bowl in the sink of my bathroom so I jokingly said \"I will piss in your kitchen sink if u keep doing that\"(I wouldn't it was a joke). He cried to my father about that and I heard from my father \"Remember that bathroom isn't fully yours\" and that \"You can move out nobody holds you here by force\"\n\nIt was two months ago\n\nWell about the bathroom: \nWe have two bathrooms the one I am writing about, it is in more of a bedroom part of the house.\n\nOnly I clean it with the detergents that I bought.\nOnly I supply it with everything including the toilet paper that they use.\nEverything that is in that bathroom is bought,cleaned and supplied by me. (excluding hand me off laundry basket from my mother)\n\nComing back to the moving out. I wanted to tell them when everything is finalized with my fiance by my side. Yes, my fiance is flying here to help me pack and move out. Lately as my father saw my fiance he told me he doesn't want to see him here if it's not necessary. \n\nI will tell them myself the day my fiance will get here. Of course when moving out I will give them the money for rent and clean up my room and the bathroom so I don't leave a mess and no paid rent behind me like my adoptive brother did. And move the boxes to be taken to the garage ourselves\n\nThe only thing I will ask them to do to open the garage where moving boxes will reside in for the moving company that will arrive 2 days after our departure. \n\nTLDR:\nMoving out of an abusive household and telling parents 5 days before departure. I will leave clean and without debt to paying them rent. My fiance will arrive the same day I tell them to help me pack and be my emotional support.",

      "selftext": "tried posting on another subreddit but couldnt due to karma requirements, i hope this is fine in the style i wrote it\n\nim not sure how it came to this, but ive felt it for too long now. ive always had friends, mostly from school, but even going back 8-9 years ive never felt like i belong with most of them. there was a point when i had a close friend but that has long passed. all friends ive had have been from school, and one of those friendgroups have stuck together for a few years now. i tried to socialize and be part of the group because even if i didnt feel 100% like i belong i still felt like i had fun with my friends, but as time has gone by ive had to try harder and harder to get included in less and less things. it came to a breaking point where i decided i cant do it like this anymore and i instead focused on just keeping them as online friends and trying to move on.\n\nthen i decided to move far away to a new city where i knew no one and get a fresh start. this decision was already in my plans for a long time, but the specifics of moving far was partly to force myself to make new real life friends. rent was also cheap, the scenery was nicer and there was a good university there were i decided to study.\n\nlong story short, i moved here just a few months ago but i still cant say i have made a friend. im still in contact with the old friends that i decided to just speak to online (since we have always played a lot of games) and I also keep in contact with my parents but anytime they ask anything about my new social life i feel like i have to lie or exaggerate to make it seem like im enjoying my social life.\n\nwhen i came here I had an open mind and a lot of energy i wanted to allocate to making friends. i wouldnt say i have any anxiety issues or anything like that which would prevent me from having conversations with strangers, but regardless of how many people i have spoken to i cant seem to find anyone with similar interests that seems interested in socializing, even within my classes.\n\nmost of my living expenses are taken care of with debt, and university is free here, but i still decided to get a part time job working some hours every week. i feel like ive had better connection with my small set of coworkers than anyone in my class, but now that my training is done i only see my coworkers when swapping shifts (we work alone) so i dont even feel like there's anything i can pursue there.\n\nout of the countless (or maybe countable, say around 15-20) school events (most involving drinking, which did help with striking up conversations) ive gone to and all of the different people ive spoken to there is not one person i could see myself being good friends with. At least half my class knows my name and face, but theres not any common interests that would bring any of us together outside of class, and friend groups have mostly been formed already now and i cant find the energy to break into those friend groups if i dont even have anything in common.\n\nive never enjoyed making new friends. it takes a lot of energy with a very low chance of anything coming out of it. most friends ive had over the years have been because another friend introduced us. i wish there were people i wanted to be friends with. i need the social connection and it isnt enough just to play games with my old friends online. im not looking for ideas but if anyone has read this far im not against feedback or others just venting in the comments just know i would be slow to respond as im not on reddit much or at all\n\nmaybe its too early for me to feel like my social life has failed, it has only been a few months since i moved here, but i really do not feel like i belong here yet. i want to keep an open mind and keep trying, but its draining me.\n\nill add that im a male in my early 20s, not from usa, never had a girlfriend (dont even know where to start with this one). i like being alone sometimes, and i feel like i could stay alone like this for many more months without issues, but beyond that? A year? Two? it freightens me to think it could even come to that. ive heard a lot of people have similar social issues, that its a big problem with a lot of men not having any friends (probably for women too) but when i look around at the people in my class, i cant help but feel alone in this\n\nthats probably it for me",

I honestly love my stepdaughter more than my husband. She’s amazing, kind, thoughtful, and genuinely cares about me. She goes out of her way to do little things that make my life easier and happier. Every year, she makes me a cake for my birthday, helps around the house without being asked, and even helped me out when my car broke down, she even left work early to jumpstart it. She does all of this while going to college and working a job.\n\nMeanwhile my husband is an absolute nightmare. He acts like he’s the man of the house, but in reality, it’s my stepdaughter who cleans, cooks, and keeps things running. I work as a nurse, pay all the bills and groceries, and still do so much for him, but he never seems to see it. He has his own business at home and I never see a dime of that money. He thinks he knows everything and constantly tries to make me look dumb then brushes it off with a “whatever” when I prove him wrong. He gets angry over the simplest questions, cusses at me, and treats me like I’m worthless.\n\nHe won’t cook dinner, even though he works from home, and I’ve asked him to help out. Our daughter, who works and goes to school, ends up doing it anyway even though I tell her she doesn’t need to. He rarely says “I love you,” refused to celebrate our ten-year wedding anniversary this year because it’s a “Hallmark holiday,” and won’t get me gifts for Christmas, my birthday, or Mother’s Day.\n\nHe only seems to care about smoking weed and taking naps. No hugs, no affection just constant demands. Meanwhile, my stepdaughter is always there to cuddle, help, and make life better without expecting anything in return. She’s honestly one of the kindest people I’ve ever met. I feel guilty that I love my stepdaughter more than my husband, but she’s truly the heart of this household and the one who actually makes life bearable.",

I think I peed on myself. It was humiliating. And I was 21 when it happened. I had no friends to take up for me then. It reminds me of things that are happening now. There’s an online community of people that hate me. Someone I thought was my friend is accusing me of abusing my daughter. She’s tried to get me locked up numerous times. She called the psychiatric hospital I was at and told them they shouldn’t have let me go because I’m truly crazy. I know all this and I know the people involved but when I ask them they all gas light me and say it’s not true. But I’m not crazy. I know it’s true. Even my family has turned their backs on me. I’d honestly rather be dead. Maybe I deserved what I got then and maybe I deserve it all now. It just hurts that I’ve allowed people into my life that betrayed me so badly. ",

I know so many people are stuck in these “relationships” that are really just financial arrangements held together by fear and rent prices. It’s not love anymore. It’s survival.\n\nSo yeah, I’m surviving. I get what I need, he gets to feel in control, and I pretend it’s normal. But it’s not. Capitalism kills love because it turns connection into currency. It makes people like me stay with people like him.\n\nI just needed to say that out loud somewhere.",

I hope that the universe got to enjoy a nice popcorn while all this happened because it sounds like a y/n Wattpad story.\n\nA little over a year ago, I was hanging out with a work friend and I was talking with him about how I was in an odd position with my hobbies. They completely contradict each other with one making me look like a video game nerd and the other, a cowgirl. I told him that I was looking for a new relationship but felt that I would have to pick one identity over the other which sucked. I then told him I was thinking about downloading Tinder as a last resort. He encouraged me to get it and he told me that we should look at the people together.\n\nSo I made the account and almost immediately, an old coworker popped up. We had a good laugh and after a while, I went home. I found myself mindlessly scrolling and laughing at some of the accounts because of how ridiculous they were. For a few days, I actually forgot about it and moved on.\n\nThen in comes my female coworker who I’m great friends with. She tells me that her college roommate’s boyfriend had been found with a tinder account. Normally I wouldn’t get involved but I personally had known the boyfriend for YEARS. So I start my search, ready to catch this guy. I start by his college and don’t find him, so I move onto our hometown. I’m swiping no on everyone to find him and then I stop.\n\nRight in front of my eyes is a cowboy gamer and I start looking at his entire bio. Everything is well written and laid out and he’s got the same hobbies as me, so I swipe right. I kept looking for the cheater and never found him, so once again I forgot about it.\n\nAnd then we matched. We talked for a few days and planned a date which was quite nerve wracking. I swear to god it was like someone copy pasted my personality and hobbies into a man because how the actual hell do you find someone like that ON ACCIDENT?? Our high schools were 5 minutes away from each other and I’m willing to bet I’d seen him before we officially met. In any case, the date went really well and we grew closer together.\n\nNow it’s almost been an entire year and I wouldn’t change anything for everything in the world. Thanks universe, you the best.\n\nEdit: this is not ai, I made this as a throwaway account. What ai would mention Wattpad y/n? 😂 Well it’s not my problem anyway ",

The feeling he feels that he can’t quite put his finger on after hurting a woman is usually called “shame”. So in his eyes, she now needs to be made felt … you guessed it, … shame. Their tool set? : Denial . Blame. Punishment.\n\nTo these men I wish I could say: Do the horrible thing, go on, do it - but just own it. Lets have a shared reality. So I don’t have to live the rest of my life thinking something is off with me, for imagining something happend that never did, for thinking i am at fault for the terror that was inflcited on me. To live witht he wieght and the torment inside my head.

Watching her slip away in a sterile hospital bed when she had longed to die peacefully at home is something that still aches in my heart. I wish I could go back and advocate for her, to give her the end-of-life experience she truly wanted and deserved.\n\nBefore her passing, I had some understanding of the dying process, but when it was my own mother, I couldn’t see it for what it was, at least, not soon enough. Her fading appetite, her long hours of sleep, the way her body could no longer regulate temperature, all were quiet signs that her body was preparing for its final rest. I noticed them, but far too late to truly act with the knowledge I have now.\n\nThat loss, that helplessness, became my turning point. I realized that death didn’t have to be something feared, ignored, or hidden away. It could be honored, guided, and met with dignity. My mother’s death led me to my calling: to walk beside others as they or their loved ones face their own transitions.\n\nToday, I am a death midwife and funeral service professional, dedicating my life to providing comfort, understanding, and gentle guidance at the end of life. Every family I serve, every hand I hold, is a tribute to her. I know in my heart that she’s proud of the person I’ve become, because through her death, I found my purpose.",

      "selftext": "Hi Reddit, this is my first time writing here.\n\nI (30F) and my husband (31M) have been married for 9 years. We’ve known each other since 2012, and we have a pretty and smart little girl (3 years old).\n\nI just want to share my thoughts because I don’t have anyone to talk to.\n\nLast night, after doing my skincare, I lay down in bed beside my daughter and husband. I’m the kind of person who likes putting on perfume and lotion before going to bed. When I lay down next to my husband, I felt annoyed because he was already asleep without me. When he talk I said, “Your breath is so stinky,” and he jokingly replied, “As if you’re not stinky,” then followed up with, “Well yes, you smell good though.”\n\nBut I didn’t hear the last part. I asked him what he said, and he answered, “Nothing.” I kept asking until I got upset, and he finally said he was just joking and asked why I was so pissed. Then his voice started getting louder, like he was the one who should be mad. I said, “Why is your voice getting louder at me?!” After that, we both went silent. I was really upset, but he just didn’t care.\n\nThis isn’t new. He always goes to sleep even when we fight. He doesn’t care if I go to sleep angry and upset. I’ve gotten used to it.\n\nSo I got up, grabbed my blanket, pillow, phone, and lotion. He said, “Yeah, you’re going downstairs again.” I just shrugged and went down to the sofa, where I fell asleep. In the morning, he got ready for work and left without even talking to me, even though he saw me sleeping on the sofa.\n\nI’m so used to this. In the past, whenever we weren’t okay, I would cry my eyes out alone. But last night, I fell asleep without crying. Still, when he left for work this morning, my tears came. I tried to stop crying, but I remembered the past like when he physically hurt me during fights.\n\nWhen our baby was still little, we fought and he dragged me off the bed while I was holding her. We both fell, but thank God there was a spare foam mattress on the floor. I protected my baby with my arms. My clothes ripped from how hard he dragged me! he pulled me by the front of my shirt.\n\nHe hasn’t hurt me just once or twice, but many times. The worst was when we fought and he tried to suffocate me. He pushed his arm against my neck while my back was pressed against the refrigerator. The most painful part was that our little daughter was there, watching and crying. My father-in-law came downstairs after hearing the noise and tried to stop him. When he couldn’t, he just took my daughter and tried to calm her down.\n\nThat was when I thought about divorcing him. But I don’t have a job, I’m a full-time mom and my husband is the only one working. I also don’t have family or friends here, only his family. At one point, he even let me and my daughter go back to our home country for a vacation, and I spent time with my family. My grandmother didn’t want me to return to him, but my daughter kept asking for her dad. I couldn’t take it, because she loves him so much.\n\nHe can be a good dad, but only for a short time. He doesn’t play with her for long. That’s why she loves it when her godmother/aunt comes home woth her bf because he plays with her a lot. My daughter gets so excited whenever visitors come, because she knows her dad won’t play with her much. But her dad still try to play and have time with her.\n\nI know I’m not a perfect wife! I’m far far far from perfect. But he takes care of me and our daughter, and he even does a lot of chores that I don’t do. Sometimes, when we fight, he tries to console me. But what I really hate is how he just goes to sleep even when we’re not okay. I can’t stand sleeping when things aren’t resolved.\n\nI think I just needed someone to talk to. Thanks, Reddit.",

I had actually been feeling a bit better recently, but that day I really needed to talk to someone and get support.\n\nWhen I arrived, I explained everything to the nurse on duty, that the clinic had sent me there because they couldn’t see me sooner. She clearly knew I was referred from the outpatient clinic, but she didn’t tell me that I wouldn’t actually be able to get a consultation there. She just told me to wait.\n\nI waited almost six hours. When I finally saw the doctor, instead of empathy or help, I was met with contempt. He spoke to me in a way that made me feel worthless, like I didn’t even deserve to be there.\n\nI left feeling worse than I have in months, honestly, worse than during my most severe episodes. It was one of the most humiliating and painful experiences of my life.\n\nAnd at the end, the doctor gave me a private prescription, which I had to pay for in full, it honestly felt like punishment.\n\nSince that day, I’ve been completely put off from seeing a psychiatrist again. I feel anxious and even terrified at the thought of going back, especially to a male psychiatrist. I never thought one bad experience could make me so afraid of seeking help.\n\nHas anyone else gone through something like this?",

      "title": "My [25F] fiancé’s [26M] mom has made our engagement unbearable. I think I need to go no contact.",
      "selftext": "I am new to reddit and this is a throw away so no one involved finds this post. \nSince these events span over years I am going to do my best to organize this in chronological order to make the most sense.\n\nMy fiancé and I have been best friends since early high school. We officially started dating in 2022. After almost 6 years of friendship and 4 years of dating, we finally got engaged 3 weeks ago. Which should have been one of the happiest times of our lives. Unfortunately, his mother has made it anything but.\n\nWhen my now fiancé called his parents to tell them he planned to propose they initially gave their blessing then quickly changed the subject and made the entire conversation about how he is a failure. They later said the issue was that he shared the news over the phone instead of face to face. He initially planned to tell them in person, but they were out of town on the weekend he had off. Since we live 6 hours away he thought a phone call was best way to do it.\n\nThe tension didn’t start there, though it’s been building for years. A while ago I planned a birthday dinner for my boyfriend (now fiancé) and invited his parents. I thought it was a kind gesture. His mom reacted by reportedly hyperventilating and saying I was “stealing her son.” She cried and he had to comfort her. Afterward she banned me from their house and from texting her. \n\nEight months later , it was my birthday. I was already over it, but my boyfriend (now fiancé) told me to give her an opportunity to tell me happy birthday. Surprise… she didn’t. My boyfriend reached out and asked why. Her response? I didn’t come by her house therefore she did not wish me a happy birthday (yes, the house I had been banned from). They offered to have me over to “start new” when asked if they’d apologize they said they were not going to speak about the past. I already knew how this was going to go. I also lived 7.5 hours away at the time in Pennsylvania, but I went anyway because I knew it would mean a lot to my boyfriend.\n\nDuring that visit, I made an offhand comment complimenting him and his mom:\n\n“You can tell he was raised by a woman.”\n\nOver a year later she has recently told my fiancé that she found that “the most disrespectful thing she’s ever heard.” This is her reasoning as to why she has refused to speak to me since though, to be fair, she barely spoke to me before.\n\nAs I’m sure you can assume, she has never invited me to a holiday, never told me happy birthday, and once told others she was “ready for grandkids. Just not from us.” (My fiancé is her oldest son)\n\nAt a football game, she even looked me up and down, turned to my then boyfriend and said, “Well at least you look good.”\n\n When we got engaged my fiancé called his parents to tell them the happy news. Two days later, his mom called back. Not to celebrate, but to accuse him of being a liar and a manipulator, and to say she “didn’t want to deal with his new fiancé” (me). For context the ohonecall started as a list of over 20 questions like, “Why the urgency?” And “How much was the ring?” This was also the phonically where she let him know how disrespectful my “raised by a woman” comment was. \n\nThen just a few days later and now two weeks ago, my dad passed away. My fiancé told his mom. She didn’t send condolences, didn’t reach out, Nothing. Her entire response was a single text that said, ”That’s sad.” This broke my heart. It offended my fiancé deeply because the mother he knew always raised him to even tell stranger that he is sorry for their loss. He always witnessed her go above and beyond for people who are grieving \n\nMy fiancé called his mom a few days ago to tell her my parents wanted to take us all out to dinner this weekend when we are in town. That my parents want to meet and celebrate. She and his dad said they have “no time” for dinner. Immediately after that, they told him he needed to come home alone to “have a discussion to find common ground” before the wedding. This is when they let him know telling them about to engagement over the phone was disrespectful. \n\nThis phone conversation that started by asking them to dinner with is and my parents then spiraled into insults where she called him “disrespectful,” “a liar,” “a little b*tch,” “a trashy loud mouth prick” and more. \n\nAnd then came the part of the phone call that broke me\n\n(“The man” is in reference to my fiancé’s father)\n“Respect the man that ki**ed himself for you. He wasn’t out traveling for work to hang out with chicks and be on drugs.”\n\nI know these were her exact words because my fiancé and I recorded the call. My dad struggled with addiction, and the way she said that immediately after referencing death felt like a deliberate cruel jab at my father no less than two weeks after his passing.\n\nOn this same phone call she is now demanding that before the wedding, my fiancé “come home alone” to “sit face to face” with her and his dad so they can “clear the air.” She keeps calling it “respect” but it’s clear what she really means is submission.\n\nThrough all of this I have remained polite, patient, and respectful. But hearing her weaponize my father’s death… that was it for me. I can’t unheard the contempt in her voice or the guilt she tried to plant in her son.\n\nI have decided the only healthy option for me is to go no contact (even though her and I basically already are). I don’t care what my fiancé chooses to do. That’s his relationship to deal with, but I don’t want or need any connection from her.\n\nThis Friday my fiancé is going to have the “common ground” convo with his parents. I think this could be a turning point in what he decides to do moving forward. Our engagement party is next week. I’ll try to update after that. \n\nThank you so much for reading any insight or advice is welcomed.",

I know it's stupid to feel like this when people have real problems. \n\n Growing up I didn't always get them because we were poor as hell. Over half I was told I'd have to wait until tax time and the rest I didn't get what I want. I'm used to being let down, so it's my fault for getting my hopes up. As an adult I've tried to do something every year to make up for it but it isn't easy. \n\n All I've managed is dinner with my mom. I was gonna see a movie with some friends last weekend but one of the guys child care fell through so it turned into baby sitting until he fell asleep and our mutual friend dropped out. I was going to a haunted house this upcoming weekend but everyone canceled. I was gonna go to dinner with my dad the next day but he canceled too. That was everyone and everything this year. \n\n Every year I feel awful. I look forward to getting to see my friends and family then it never fully pans out. I feel guilty even asking at this point. Clearly they don't care that much, it's not like my existence is worth celebrating. I shouldn't be so hung up on something so childish but I help feeling hurt. ",

But as someone who’s currently dealing with some genuinely heavy stuff (sexual assault, the death of a close relative, the end of a long-term relationship, a recent layoff, etc.), it’s honestly exhausting listening to her complain about these trivial issues.

They say living with your ex can make the breakup drag out and you can start to hate each other which isn’t what I want. I also can’t tell him or my friends about the date because I don’t want to seem callous or hurt his feelings and we’re all in a friend group together. \n\nIt’s also annoying to see him sad sometimes bc it’s like you did this but whatever, I know that feeling isn’t valid and I’m glad that he left a relationship that he didn’t feel happy in. \n\nMy coworkers say there’s prob someone else in his life but they’re both pretty jealous/insecure people and their claims are based on 0 evidence.

      "selftext": "I'm probably beyond cooked but I figured I'd try to get advice anyways. How can I make myself enjoy learning or struggling? I work nearly full time at a job while in college full time. I'm 21, and a Computer Science major in my last year. Most of my degree has been for nothing.\n\nI have retained little from my degree. Beyond that, I have consistently struggled for my entire college life. I was an Honors / AP / DE student with straight A's up until my senior year of HS, blah blah life stuff, I fell into a horrible depression and started to do poorly in school, etc. blah blah. In college, the problem seems to persist but at a much worse level.\n\nI struggle with my homework IMMENSELY and have no idea how to fix it. I have to spend hours and hours on almost every assignment I get and I never can figure it out. Some stuff is menial, but most of the time it's complex enough that I struggle way too much. In my freshman year, I'd try coding assignments for 10-20 hours and never finish in time for a deadline so I'd try to copy other work last minute. For math, it'd be the same where I would spend 5-10 minutes per problem because I just couldn't grasp the concepts. I spend most of my time merely trying to understand the bare minimum, I never even have the time to actually get good at the material or understand the homeworks to a point where I can just do them because I understand it.\n\nI don't know if I'm just an idiot, or what. Maybe my brain is too fried. I've made a small game demo that I am pretty proud of, but that was mostly using tutorials and barely tweaking it to my bidding. I can't seem to balance how long it takes me to do homework with my job, but I need the money to LIVE. It seems so easy for everyone else. They can knock out homework in 1-2 hours flat. I never have time to actually study because all of my time is spent on assignments and not understanding them, wasting hours and hours just to give up because I never figured it out. I'd nearly always end up cheating in some way to keep good grades.\n\nI'm probably too cooked for graduation, but I figured I'd try to salvage what little time I have left and at least try to fix the wiring in my brain somehow. I want to stop relying on AI or cheating but I can't seem to break the curse. I never seem to have the time I want nor do I know how to think on a deep, complex level and actually solve problems. I know the common thing is to break a problem into smaller problems, but even that doesn't work because I don't even know how to solve the small ones, and when I do, putting all the pieces together creates Frankenstein and doesn't work. I'm not going to sit here and say I'm a genius, but I'm not stupid. I have some semblance of a brain I think.\n\nI probably should have prefaced this, but I am diagnosed autistic and also suffer from BPD which probably plays a factor but I'm not going to get into it or expect a pity party, as plenty of people like me have persevered. I want to enjoy learning again, or learn how to struggle without ever giving up, but I just can't. I can't ever meet the deadlines placed on me. This is mostly a rant but I also am begging people for advice. I need someone to be honest and help me get my shit together. I don't expect any one person to have the perfect answer, but I need to hear everything from likeminded people so I can navigate better. Please help me.",

      "selftext": "My name is Aiden, I'm a 28-year-old woman, and I'm getting married this weekend to Mark, a wonderful 36-year-old man.\n\nWe've been together for 8 years, and we got engaged last December.\n\nHe proposed to me with my mom and my brothers at a beautiful restaurant in the city.\n\nAnd I don't know what to think about this situation, because it's not \\[I don't know if my mom is too picky; traditions aren't their thing\\], and I honestly don't know what to say or do to my mom because she complains a lot about my in-laws because:\n\n1. I didn't know my mother-in-law was buying my wedding dress, and my mother-in-law insisted on going to the capital to buy it. We went to a place with beautiful dresses with my mom, my mother-in-law, my younger brother, and my godmother.\n\nShe didn't buy it, she just bought me some beautiful heels.\n\nI wanted my mother-in-law's opinion on the dress, so I wanted her to come with us. My godmother and my mother took it as an insult.\n\n2. They haven't asked much about the wedding or my fiancé's family; they only invited 70 people.\n\nThey asked things like the date of the presentation at the church \\[which they must attend\\].\n\nIf I can set aside four tables at the front of the room and if it's okay for some of their nieces to be matrons of honor \\[we are Catholic\\].\n\n3. My fiancé didn't mention whether they would be supporting us financially, and the truth is, I don't care. What happened is that my mother and I are paying for the wedding.\n\n4. And what my mother has been insisting on lately:\n\nThey haven't proposed to my family. The only time the two families have gotten together was five months ago at a noisy restaurant, and they asked about things that were already there.\n\nI don't know what I should do with my mom because she's a mental burden I can't carry right now. She insists I should know how to answer her questions, that they should know the protocols and traditions because her oldest daughter is married in both a church and civil ceremony.\n\nMy sister-in-law has been even more attentive to the wedding than my in-laws, even with the smallest details. For example, I asked my mother-in-law and sister-in-law for photos of my fiancé as a child without him knowing so I could make a video showing photos of them as children and as a couple.\n\nMy mother-in-law replied that she couldn't find any and that she'd only use the couple photos, while my sister-in-law sent me several.\n\nI've been thinking about talking to them without my fiancé at a restaurant to see what's going on, and if there's a problem with the wedding, the date, or if I'm the one who's involved, to try to fix it, but maybe that's stupid.\n\nI asked my fiancé to talk to him because my mom wants to have a serious talk with him, and I don't want that to happen because it could be very hurtful and even lead to yelling.\n\nWhat should I do?",

      "title": "My parents abused me, I tried to go no contact, and I can’t get away",
      "selftext": "I still have a hard time admitting I was abused, even to myself. I was raised in a “reformed baptist” household by a well respected church leader- the view we gave the outside world was spotless. We weren’t even allowed to sit with friends during church service because that would “send a message of disunity”. I remember several occasions where my “rebelliousness” was challenged with the passage about a pastor having their house in order and my father’s threat that, if I didn’t get in line, he would lose his job or have to quit. He never did quit. He did cause several church splits in hindsight. I was spanked growing up. I don’t know how I feel about spanking as a whole- I know some people who seem to do it “right” if there is such a thing. What my parents did was certainly not it. I will never spank my children. My parents spanked us to demand immediate obedience, no matter what it was for. I got spanked for reading in the bathroom, for missing a spot on the kitchen sink, or for not cleaning up my room fast enough. Spankings were bare bottomed, with a wooden stick. At one point (my mother loves to tell this story and laugh) my mother spanked my brother so hard the logo on the spanking spoon was imprinted on his butt. She broke the spoon and couldn’t stop laughing. When she finally did- she got another spoon. I was spanked for crying too much during discipline (spirit of weakness) and for not crying enough (spirit of defiance). I could go on but I won’t.\n\nWhat’s important to know is that I and my siblings are all adults now- my youngest sister turns 25 this year. With the exception of one brother, who acts and thinks like them, we are all varying levels of no contact with them at the moment.\n\nAs an oldest daughter (and late diagnosed autistic) I always was the peacekeeper. My brother was the first to cut them out and he did it silently- just unfriended them on social media and blocked their numbers. I kept talking to him and hoped we could fix it eventually. My sisters situation was more dramatic and fully her story alone to tell, but suffice it to say she endured significant trauma from an outside person and they blamed her for it. She tried for several years, with our help and mediation, to make it work anyways- even to the point of cooking meals for them and helping around the house. But eventually they brought it up again and when she refused to apologize to them they kicked her off of their insurance and told her over an email. She hasn’t spoken to them since. I have children who love their grandparents deeply so it felt harder for me. My parents sucked at raising us but they were seemingly decent grandparents. Still my parents remained controlling into my adulthood and my husband and I let them talk down to us. We sat down and counted at one point and in the first five years of marriage we were having a minimum of one “meeting” every two months with them. These meetings would go exactly the same way every time- my parents would say “hey let’s get coffee” to my husband. He’d say “okay, my wife is coming”. They’d throw a fuss, he’d put his foot down, and suddenly we’re all four meeting at their house or ours at which point they give us the list of ways we are not “honoring God right”. The list ranged from not keeping a clean enough house, to us daring to get our kids tested for autism. We would hear them out and consider carefully, then make decisions as a family and let them know what we would be doing. They would roll their eyes and tells us why we were wrong. We would let them know we didn’t want them interfering in our parenting, they would do it anyways. Eventually we hit a breaking point. I had made the decision, with my husbands agreement, not to tell my parents anything about the comings and goings of my sister who was no contact by this point. My parents found out and demanded to speak with my husband without me. He pushed but eventually relented, with the decision to record the conversation. He left battered and defeated- my dad had convinced my husband he was a bad dad and husband. He told my husband to “get your wife in line” and then proceeded to equate my decision not to share my sisters life to being a habitual liar and cheater. They said my husband would cheat on me because I decided not to tell them where my sister was. I was done. I sent them a strongly worded email explaining why I would no longer be speaking to them. I hit send. I was expecting an explosion, but it was so much worse than I expected. My parents got their church involved and their church leaders immediately began harassing my church leaders over the phone and email. Eventually they pressured us and our church into mediation meetings. Honestly all I needed was a break from constantly trying to navigate the accusations and derision from my parents and somehow I am a year into even more harsh deliberations than before. I’ve asked for an apology- they give none. I go to counseling, they say it’s not the right kind. I ask them to go to counseling and they tell us to trust that their friends are giving them wise counsel. At this point they have changed nothing. Just the other day I found out they had been going through my reposts on TikTok and found one that they claim proves I have an “unrepentant spirit”. It was an accidental repost, but more importantly why on earth are they going through my reposts? I fully privated my account. We have gone back to allowing 2hr visits with their grandkids, but only in neutral locations and only with my husband present. They want more. They are constantly checking to be sure I’m still in counseling but still refuse to see a therapist. My therapist is actually the one who suggested I put this on here to get it off my chest. At the end of the day- I don’t hate my parents. But I sure don’t want anything to do with them and they seemed determined to beat my down until I give up and grovel back to them. I’m ashamed to say I have done that in the past. I can’t do that anymore- at the very least for the sake of my kids. If they’re not willing to do their part, reconciliation cannot happen. I want reconciliation- but not at the cost of my sanity.\n\nAnd at the end of the day- I want a mom who will listen. Not judge.\n\nI’ve always done what they asked of me. I was the “golden child”. I’m done desperately seeking to keep my place on the pedestal so they don’t throw me out. The problem is they’d rather grind my bones to dust than let me walk away from it. I don’t know what to do.\n\nAnyways. Just wanted to get that off my chest.",

She sent a friend request and we ended up playing both Friday and Saturday nights.\n\nWhile playing together i didn’t ask her for any personal info for safety reasons but due to other people (often obvious teens) we met while playing asking those and her and the other players revealing their info (first name, home country but nothing more thankfully) i did too.\n\nSince then i’ve been getting the feeling that she might have taken a liking to me which scares me due to the age difference. But she’s never made actual remarks to this being the case so it could be me being paranoid. This is also completely one-sided as i didn’t make any remarks myself.\n\nSince i’m still studying, i leave for campus during the weeks and am home on weekends. I can’t play this game much during the week due to my classes and work schedule and told her about this. I, thinking she was in my age range, proposed to keep in contact through social media on Saturday night.\n\nI asked her how old she was and she mentioned her being 17. That flipped a switch in me and i’ve been puzzled as to what to do now. She asked to play again yesterday and i replied quite bluntly but we haven’t had contact since Saturday. I think of her as nothing more than a friend and due to the obvious age circumstances refuse to think further. It’s currently eating at me as i’m feeling like i’m a predator. I’m trying to figure out whether i should cut things off entirely or set clear boundaries.\n\nDespite all this i do enjoy our games together on a strictly friendly level. I’ve had adult online friends when i was still a late teen and luckily it was just friendships but now that i’m on this end of the stick i have no idea what i should do now.",

There’s this male coworker who I have always had a good relationship with and who has always helped me, but I gradually developed intense feelings for him (largely because he is the only person in the office who was nice and decent to me and not aligned with the manager, everyone else supported that manager for their own benefit and I felt super isolated).  I don’t even know it’s romantic/situational/trauma-induced as without that manager’s exploitation I don’t think I would have ever developed these feelings - I always liked him as a person as he is genuinely decent and also charismatic.\n\nThen weeks after I developed feelings I learned he actually had a partner (I didn’t know that before and it seems to be a recent relationship too) and I felt both heartbroken and embarrassed. If I had known he was unavailable I probably could have restrained my feelings, but to be perfectly honest he wasn’t exactly acting like someone with a partner, and the attachment has already formed now.\n\nHow can I get over it? Obviously, I wouldn’t even try to get into a relationship with him even if he didn’t had a partner as I don't do workplace romance, but I genuinely also really like him on a personal/professional level even without the romantic feelings, and I don’t want to damage the working relationship either, and I kinda want to be just friends.",

I feel like I’ve been fighting nonstop for years and nothing ever gets better…\n\nI was officially diagnosed as autistic about two years ago, but I had already known for a while. Before that, I was constantly in therapy, in and out of hospitals, and being told I had depression, anxiety, or that I was just “not trying hard enough.” None of it helped because no one understood how to actually help me. Even now, I can’t find support that fits. Every therapist or hotline I reach out to seems overwhelmed, like I’m too complicated or too much to deal with.\n\nI dropped out of school a few years ago, partly because of autistic burnout and partly because my mom was terminally ill. I helped take care of her until she passed away last March. That whole time feels like a blur honestly… hospital visits, exhaustion, fear, grief. After she died, everything kind of fell apart. I live with my brother now, but we’re being forced to move because the house (which my stepdad owns) has water damage and mold. We’ve tried to fix it for years with minimal success. Now that the problem is found stepdad wants to sell the house. \n\nMy stepdad has already moved on. He was my mom’s husband, but he was also like a father to me since my real dad isn’t in my life, and it hurts so much to see him just… disappear emotionally. He’s focused on his new girlfriend, his new life. I keep realizing that maybe he only cared because of my mom. Now that she’s gone, I feel like I’ve lost both parents.\n\nI tried working recently, hoping it would help me get back on track, but I got fired less than a month in. I have debt piling up, no savings, and no idea how to handle any of it. My front teeth are literally rotting from stress, vomiting, and grinding but I just can’t afford dental treatment. I’m ashamed of how I look, so I don’t want to go out. I don’t have energy for anything.\n\nI have one close friend, but I’m terrified of losing her. She’s been distant since she got into a relationship, and I can feel that I rely on her way too much. I know that’s not fair to her, but I also don’t have anyone else. I’ve never had a real support network… just a few people who drift in and out of my life.\n\nMost days, I wake up and I don’t know what to do with myself. I don’t see a future. I don’t have a plan. I just exist in this constant state of panic and grief and emptiness. Every day I just want to give up. When I try to explain it to people, they look at me like I’m speaking another language. Even when I call suicide helplines, they say they don’t know how to help me. One told me that my situation is “too complicated.” Hearing that makes me feel like there’s no hope for someone like me.\n\nI don’t even know what I want from posting this. I don’t expect advice. I just feel like I need to scream into the void a bit, because otherwise I’ll just sit here feeling invisible. I feel like my life never really started, and now it’s basically over already. \n\nYeah idk, thanks for reading ✌🏼\n",

      "title": "I’ve been hooking up with my ex for a month and just found out he has a serious girlfriend",
      "selftext": "\nMy ex boyfriend and I broke up about a year ago. When we were together, our relationship was very up and down. Extremely passionate, most love I’ve ever been in, but he was controlling, manipulative, we were constantly arguing, he was physically aggressive. Therapy helped me get it out of it and finally realize how unhealthy everything was so I ended it. \n\nA year’s gone by and I thought I had moved on from it. I’ve had a rough year, I was lonely, I missed him. I unblocked him and texted him. Which is extremely out of character for me. He responded immediately and ultimately, he has been spending 1 night a week at my place for the last month. I don’t want to get back together with him and was very upfront with him about this. But the nights he’s here it’s been amazing. He tells me he loves me, wants to marry me, have kids together, etc, not that I believe him (maybe I wanted to). He has a history of love bombing. We have incredible sex all night and spend the night in each other’s arms. \n\nWe were on the phone last night, he was in the car and wouldn’t be upfront about where he was going. I called him out on it and he hung up and wound up knocking on my door later that night. I brought up my suspicions that he’s lying to me again and he confessed he’s in a serious relationship with a girl he started dating in May. Says she’s a great person. They go to church every Sunday morning. When we were on the phone, he was headed to her apartment, dropping off a heat pad for her because she’s not feeling well and then he showed up at my door directly from there. He called ME last night. It made me feel sick. Says he only cheated on her because he’s so in love with me and couldn’t help himself and lied to me because he knew I wouldn’t have let him back into my life if I knew he was seeing someone. I knew better than to get involved with him again, and yet here we are. \n\nI told him to leave, blocked him again. I feel so stupid and selfish for reaching out to him a month ago. He’s pretty off grid and doesn’t have social media. We don’t have mutual friends. I knew nothing about her. I feel awful for knowing what I know now and not doing anything about it. Before he left, I told him I wanted nothing more to do with him. He told me if that’s the case, he’s going to keep seeing her. Apparently, it’s the healthiest relationship he’s had and he’s not going to tell her he cheated. And if I want to ‘get back at him’ I could try to figure out how to contact her myself and tell her.\n\nI don’t want to talk to my friends about this because I’m embarrassed I started seeing him again and I know how strongly they dislike him for how he treated me, and how strongly they feel about cheating. Even though it’s not necessarily my fault, I still feel responsible. And I feel incredibly stupid for feeling blindsided when I knew better. ",

      "selftext": "TL; DR: I have like three friends, my closest of which recently got into a relationship, now we have less contact. Now I'm salty and jealous of happy people with social lives. I also hate myself for being so salty and not letting her enjoy things.\n\nJust to make things clear: I am not mad at my friend (let's call her Rosa), I'm in fact happy for her. I like her bf aswell, he's nice, and I wish them all the best. \n\nHowever, it makes me jealous. Not because I am interested in Rosa or her bf, but because of my loneliness. I am almost 19 years old and have never been in a relationship. I only have like 6 friends, but 3 of them ghosted me, so really it's 3. Most people my age are partying and doing stuff with their friends, and I am sitting alone in my room, slowly going insane. \n\nMy friends also rarely have time for me, due to their hobbies, family, travel, school, etc. Except for Rosa before she got into that relationship. She was the only friend I would regularly meet up with, the only friend that texted me first sometimes, the only friend who seemed like she genuinely cared about me the same way I cared about her. \n\nBut that all changed when she met her boyfriend. She doesn't have time for me anymore. She doesn't text me anymore unless I text her. We don't meet as often. \n\nEven though Rosa and I were never anything more than platonic friends, - hell, I was never even close to being her best friend - it feels like her boyfriend took her away from me. This feeling is of course very dumb, and I hate myself for not being happy for her. She is not obligated to hang out with me. She should do what she wants. \n\nI also hate that there's something irrational in me that feels attacked by her relationship. Every time she posts a cute story with her bf, that thing in me gets so salty. Like \"oH LoOk aT uS, wE'Re hAPpY aNd iN LovE anD nOt dEaD iNsiDe. Get fucked!\"\n\nTwo of my friends are in relationships, and all of them have better friends. People they like more than me. I am nobody's special person. I felt like I was the closest to being Rosa's someone, at least more than for any of my two other friends, but her relationship showed me how far away I was from that. ",

I hadn’t smoked for a couple days and got too excited, so I went overboard. Yesterday it happened again, and to the people in that lobby – I’m sorry. Different weed, same result. You know the story.\nThe truth is: I feel nothing. My memories are fading more and more every day. I feel numb inside. I can’t even remember what joy feels like anymore, because my addiction has gotten so bad that every time I touch weed or drugs, I crash. And when I have money, I know I’ll go back.\nI’ve had my ups, but the downs were always heavier. My thoughts are slipping away, one by one. Maybe one day this numbness will fade, maybe I’ll feel better again – but right now I don’t know.\nSometimes I tell myself I’ll never “make it to the sky” because of all the lies I told, the people I hurt, and the mistakes I made. But maybe… maybe at least I’ll end up somewhere, around people who can help shape me into something better.\nI don’t even know if this makes sense, but it’s just a small piece of how I feel in this nothingness of a life.\n\n\n(This was originally a message to a friend of mine, but I reworded it a bit and never sent it)\n\nThank you for reading it.

I'd say I'm a decent-looking dude, maybe a 6 or 7 out of 10, 6ft tall with an average build and a good sense of style.\n\nBack in my undergrad and school days, I had a couple of girls interested in me, they have txt me (usually I'll try to end the convo with some generic answers), but I was mostly just messing around with my guy friends doing some lame yet fun dude stuff and didn't pay much attention. Now that I'm in grad school, I'm actually trying to meet people, so I decided to give Bumble a serious shot. I even paid for the weekly subscription to maximize my chances.\n\nI spent a week swiping right on every single woman that came up on my profile. The result? Absolutely zero matches. It's a strange feeling to walk around campus and see women who I know for a fact left-swiped me. I feel naked abt myself walking around them, especially if they're hot. Now I hate good looking people. Now, whenever I go to the gym and see a hot or good looking women, I don't even wanna go near her.\n\nHere's where it gets weird. Out of sheer curiosity, I switched my preference to men. Within that same week, I racked up over 50 likes.\n\nHas anyone else had a similar experience? I'm trying to figure out if there's something specific about my profile that's turning women off, or if the dynamics on these apps are just this skewed. Is it the algorithm? Is it my profile? I'm open to any and all feedback.\n\nThanks for reading.",

Technically we're all part of the same company, but it feels a bit like outsourcing. Our department handles support, and production happens over there.\n\nA new female coworker, 20s, very smart and polite, had a request assigned to her by our boss. The request originally came from the general manager in Austria, a guy in his 40s. All these requests gets assigned.\n\nIt shouldn’t have been assigned to her as she was new but she followed the rules: if you have questions, call the person who submitted the request. So she reached out and asked if she could call him. He said yes. She didn’t have a solution, so the call was a bit useless, but his reaction was completely over the top.\n\nI overheard him raising his voice, saying things like he was done with our bad joke of a work and we are making a bad joke out of this services. \n\nShe became defensive and told him its not her fault that the platform isn't working and he cut her off. And who's fault it is? She kept telling him she cannot help him and he was irritated and frustrated she cannot help him and she tried to tell him that the platform is maintained in India and he was like: I don't care if its lndia's fault or N orth K orea's fault. Since your department is dealing with it nothing is working\n\nI told her to tell him she can talk to her boss about his concerns. and he didn't like her answer. Because she \"Suggested\" she can talk to her boss. Its mandatory, not just something you can do, he said raising voice again. She was intimidated. Some parts I didn't hear but at some point he asked her: do you even read what I wrote? Ok, lets check this together. Can we do something very basic together and check this?\n\nShe told him to not speak to her this way and treat her with respect, as she treats him but he denied not treating her right. He kept on saying stuff lile you don't understand what I am saying.\n\nHe is older than us. Indeed customer service is not the most brilliant department, but we are at the start of our careers and she is a very smart young lady (in her 20s). Polite too and beautiful (and yes, she has a profile picture). Indeed he put there an information that she did read but because she was so affected, she simply forgot and felt lost. Anyway, he didn't have to ask her if she even reads what he wrote.\n\nI encouraged her to report him and she did to the headquarters and he was contacted by them to fix his attitude.\n\n",

      "selftext": "We met through a language exchange app. I wasn't planning on being in a relationship at this time, heck even in an LDR (we are literally antipodes to each other on earth) in fact, the reason we met is that I wanted to improve my spanish, but she somehow managed to slip her way in through my walls that were built up from past traumas.\n\nI was happy casually speaking in spanish to strangers on the app, even though I'm an introvert, I had the urge to chat up people in a language that I was excited to speak in. I would chat up people first, but this one girl. She was different. She was the one who started chatting me. We started off well, and the vibes were on point, it felt like we were long lost friends.\n\nWe talked about our interests, top 5s, and how similar our cultures are. I mentioned how I am fascinated by their country's geography, especially their famous waterfall, because I used to look up photos of it in 2nd grade thinking \"how on earth is this so tall?\" We later exchanged instagram profiles, and sent memes to each other.\n\nNow being the cautious person I am, I treated her as a friend, hoping this boundary would define where we stand. But the more we talked, the flirtier she got. Of course, I immediately thought \"Oh, this is their culture, flirting is dancing with words.\" So I flirted back. I know, I should've stopped there, but I just thought of it as friendly banter, I couldn't help myself.\n\nI thought nothing of it initially, but day by day, we started to get closer and closer, despite being separated by our phone screens. she knew how to soften me up and show the loverboy side that I didn't even know existed. It eventually came to a point where both of us decided to be in a long distance relationship. Now I have my doubts about LDRs and I might've been blinded by love, but I really wanted her to be my one and only. She felt like home.\n\nNow at this time, I was unemployed, I had a pending interview for a job in the IT industry. At first, I thought nothing of it, but now that's she slowly beginning to be a part of my life, I locked in. We always talked about the stuff we're gonna do in person, dates we planned, and of course wanting to finally see and embrace each other (despite her country being in an unstable state, etc.) so I needed this job.\n\nUnfortunately, I didn't get it, but now I have this fire inside me that motivates me to get a job. I have never felt this locked in before. I kept applying at jobs, even at ones that don't align with my skillset, as long as the goal is to get money and meet her. However, the IT industry in my city aren't look for new hires at the moment. So I settled for a job in the BPO industry.\n\nA month has passed since we officially started dating and I'm still in love with her like the first day we started flirting. I was so obsessed with her. (At this point, I started to question myself if I was infatuated) I also noticed my vocabulary and my ability to read in spanish has improved. I never managed to quickly deconstruct a sentence so fast before, although given I had prior knowledge, but even then it's still progress.\n\nNow... two months have passed, I am still in love with her as ever, but she suddenly felt distant. She said she's going through things. I was patient with her, so I gave her time for herself. But, at this point, it felt like she was avoiding me. I emphasized to her the importance of communication especially in an LDR.\n\nAnd then my gut feeling started to feel something. Her terms of endearment are gone. The I love you's we used to say are now rarer than Plutonium. So, I broke the silence. I told her to be honest with me. She said she doesn't like the distance. The LDR. But in my mind, I screamed, \"didn't both of us wanted this? The goal was to see each other. Why would you lead me on?\"\n\nNow I've heard of the honeymoon phase in relationships, and yeah this could be an example of that. She said she couldn't do it anymore. I wanted it to work, but there was nothing I can do anymore. I don't want to force things. But the one thing that got stuck in my mind was that \"If they really wanted to, they would've. Love will never find an excuse.\" And I realized, I was just a pastime for her. Time and energy that I spent, all went down to the drain.\n\nNow the language that I used to love learning, feels empty now. The excitement I used to get from learning, gone. It feels like I'm being haunted by a ghost of what could've been.\n\nWherever you are right now... I hope life treats you well. I love you, and goodbye.",

      "selftext": "People never let me complain because I’m some awesome straight A student and I already get to live with my boyfriend at 17. They think my life is amazing, and I’m just forced to play into it and act like I love everything and I’m so happy. The truth is, it feels like nothing is going right in my life. I have looked at every school assignment for the past six weeks and had no motivation to do any of it, but the second I tell someone they don’t believe me because my grades are so high. The only reason my grades are so high is because I can’t let myself have an actual reminder that I’m failing at life. I can’t see how far I’ve slipped every time I check my grade book. I don’t even know why I can’t do school work. It’s always come easy to me, but I look at it and it’s just too much. And living with my boyfriend isn’t amazing either. Everybody acts like it’s awesome because we’re “basically like a married couple” but teenagers aren’t supposed to live together. It’s not healthy at all, because I am forced to do whatever he says or else I’m a homeless teenager with no where to go. I only live with him because my parent’s home was damaging to me both physically and mentally in the most detrimental way imaginable. Me and my boyfriend yell and argue all the time and any time I try to talk about my issues to even him, he doesn’t let me. Even he thinks my life is perfect. And there’s so much more. I do band which takes up almost all my time so I’m literally always exhausted. And I have literal schizophrenia that I get absolutely no treatment for so I’ve been having visual and audible hallucinations for over a week now. It just feels like everything is crumbling around me but I have to keep up appearances because everyone around me, even my own boyfriend, gets mad at me when I show it. I have one friend that I can talk to about this with but my boyfriend hates her. I don’t know what to do anymore at all. I cry for an hour in the shower every night, I cut myself every chance I get in places where no one will see them. I feel like I’m experiencing every negative emotion there is but I’m not allowed to because no one wants to be proven wrong by seeing someone who they think is doing perfect actually struggle. With every action I take I either upset someone or remind myself of just how much my life sucks.",

      "selftext": "im 17 and havnt had friends since I was 12, i dont remember how i developed anxiety but it eventually got so bad that i stopped going to school and ive only just started to go to college this year.\n\nevery thought I have and everything I do makes me think im not good enough, and I tell myself I don’t deserve to be happy.  if momentarily I do I tell myself I’m stupid for thinking im allowed to be, or that it was embarrassing to feel nice about whatever it was that made me happy. whether its from yesterday or 3 years ago every thought makes me want to punish and hurt myself and I get stuck in a very self destructive head space. ive been physically harming myself a lot less than I used to (arguably never at this point) but its always in the back of my head. \n\nevery time i look at someone my age i think about how far behind i am; i dont know how to dress well, i dont know how to do hair or makeup, i dont see the appeal of dating and being boy-obsessed or getting involved in gossip & drama. even writing this now I feel the need to tell myself off because this sounds like i think im “quirky” and “different” and want everybody to know it or something. \nim conventionally very unattractive and i want people to know that i know it,so that i can walk around normally without worrying about people thinking that i think im better than i am. i find it especially hard at college to keep these thoughts out of my head because there are so many people i can compare myself to. \n\ni tend to go quiet when im anxious but ive been trying hard to make sure i reply to people cheerfully if they talk to me, though ive rarely been able to initiate anything myself. if i do it will only be a lesson related question or something like that. though once i heard a girl in my class say it was her birthday on a day we had a test. it took me a while to say happy birthday and afterwards I told myself off because i thought she would find it embarrassing to have me talking to her. \n\nim spending a lot of my time in the pastoral office at school because im finding it too hard to be around so many people my age. while it’s helpful to be in a quiet environment, it makes me feel worse to be there because of all the posters, cards, books and activities they have. I dont mean to sound insulting to the other people who struggle and appreciate these things, but it just reminds me that im different and that im not normal enough to know how to regulate my thoughts and feelings by myself. \n\ni obviously dont have any friends and its not looking like i will any time soon, which is on me. it sort of works for me though because i would further torture myself with thoughts that they didnt genuinely like me or that they wanted me gone. even so i do get lonely and its hard to see everyone else with each other. i dont know if ive ever had real friends because i dont think that anyone at my old school liked me. im convinced they all found me unbearably annoying and every memory i have of that time makes me feel a need to punish myself. again here i sound like i feel sorry for myself which i suppose i do, but i dont want to come across like im trying to invite sympathy or something. any way i try to put it will make it seem like that though, so sorry. \n\nim not really close with anyone in my family apart from my dad. he is spending an exceptional amount of time trying to help me with a genuine effort that i deeply appreciate. however, he is almost 80 and quite stubborn, so sometimes i find it very difficult to explain how i feel and what i think i need in a way that he can appreciate. because of his age I feel an extreme guilt that im wasting the last years of his life which is a very hard thing for me to write. he works hard to provide for us and has done an exceptional job, i dont know how he manages but he does, and although ive never admitted it, i definitely idolise him.\nwhat he doesn’t understand though is my mood. i can be affected by the most insignificant thing, a thought or feeling, literally anything. if one thing goes wrong my mood drops so low to a near unrecoverable point, and I struggle a lot with that. i can be very optimistic and bubbly one night and seem extremely depressed the next morning. it messes me up so much and feels torturous. occasionally ill switch between between good and bad feelings so suddenly and unexpectedly that I start to feel numb.\n\ni could say a lot more but this already feels like too much. thanks to anyone who endured my whole speech, and hello to anyone who scrolled down to see how far it went haha",

      "title": "I recently ended things with my partner, and I feel guilty over why.",
      "selftext": "I (29F) met my most recent partner (31M) and fell in love very quickly and unexpectedly. He has two children, 10 and 5, with 50% custody. After six months he introduced me to them. I fell in love with them too. We had incredible chemistry and I really, really loved him. I still do.\n\nA year and two months later, I ended things as we were discussing next steps. I’m struggling, bad, with whether I was holding too high an expectation of him. I miss him deeply. I love him and I don’t want anyone else.\n\nBut. He is irresponsible with money. I do not mind debt, and I was willing to work together to pay it off if we married. But he regularly expressed anxiety about finances, and then spent money impulsively on hobbies. He pursued an associates degree at a for profit school and accrued 17k in debt and did not know how much he had accrued until I insisted he look. He had no idea it was that much and broke down. He wanted to continue the degree (he has a decently paying job with no college degree), simply because it would postpone the monthly payment. When I kindly pointed out that this would put him about 20k more in debt at his current school he said he was just trying to survive.\n\nHe owes 20k on a truck he’s upside down on. He’s upside down on his house and it has a lien from the IRS. He’s borrowed thousands from his 401k. I think the total debt excluding the house is something like 80k between credit cards and these other things. Plus he provides child support to their mother. To his credit he has never been late on that. It is the other things, and the fact that he continues to accrue debt with no real plan to pay it off. Again, debt is not a dealbreaker in itself to me. My family was well off growing up and though I am not connected to them or their resources I am mindful of that and that I have been fortunate in that regard. I would have been fine to marry and live on one of our incomes and be debt free in a year. Or something to that effect. My point is that I was not going to break up with him over debt and poor money choices from the past.\n\nBut it was the approach to money and impulsiveness. He didn’t drive over to my side of town sometimes to conserve money on gas. But then he would buy items for his hobbies (spending multiple hundreds or even a thousand if he found something on FB marketplace he thought was a deal). I defaulted to covering for things we did together because he regularly expressed crushing anxiety and shame over finances. Recently he wept because he was so financially strained he couldn’t afford flowers for his daughter’s birthday. I ordered flowers and a cake from Publix for him to pick up. Three days later he got paid, and he called me to tell me he was going to spend 90 dollars on a hobby item. He already had three others of this same item. When I gently suggested he may want to conserve the money for a different experience with the kids or together, or just save it so he didn’t end up in the position he was in for her birthday, he said this made him feel selfish and he offered to pay me back. I didn’t want him to pay me back. I was very confused by his choices.\n\nWhen I brought up finances and offered to cover something nice for him to do for himself or expressed concerns for him (because of his stress levels) it gave him anxiety attacks. So I stopped.\n\nI recently got a job in a better paying field and it was closer to my side of town than his. He asked me if the job was going to put a strain on our weeknights. That made me sad.\n\nAlso, his daughter has behavioral trouble at school. Again, not a dealbreaker. I tried to do what I could do to help support him and her when I was around. I watched YouTube videos and took an online class on how to help regulate young children so I could understand better. I read everything I could find on her specific type of speech delay. I advised him for many months to pursue having her evaluated by a professional. Her teachers called a conference because his daughter was biting and scratching and hitting other kids in class. She threw a chair. He seems to blame the little girl’s mom and said his daughter was having big feelings. The teachers wrote home and were very concerned. But I was a teacher and this feels more like a cry for help from his daughter. That seems really severe. I am not a parent, but I feel like I would be trying to access every resource to get my daughter help. When I brought that up, he became anxious. Anxiety about finances…I found a child psychiatrist that took Medicaid and gave him the number. He didn’t want to make an appointment because he didn’t want to rock the boat with their mother. I just feel like the little girl needs help and obviously something is very wrong inside her, if she’s throwing things in school and screaming and biting her teachers.\n\nSometimes he communicates childishly with their mother. Their mother has borderline personality disorder and she is a bit unstable with her moods. His texts to her feel inflammatory and immature. Once she sent him a text that he didn’t like and he texted back “HA. ARE YOU SERIOUS.” To her. also, any time she texted him about something that involved conflict, he had an anxiety attack or felt like it was coming. She gave their son an iPhone and he had a full blown panic attack. He often called me to tell me things his ex said on the verge of a breakdown. I had to help him craft lots of texts to their mom. This was exhausting. Her son from a former relationship (not his) was expelled from elementary school for making violent threats. She called him crying and moved their kids school district to a different one mid year. I was concerned because the behavior was bad enough to warrant expulsion and he was still defaulting to their mother to handle his own daughter’s behavioral challenges.\n\nHe regularly discussed wanting to have babies with me and sometimes would ask to have one in the middle of intimacy. Sometimes he would ask to remove protection. I really want to be a mother. But if I am seriously considering marriage with a man, shouldn’t I be concerned for these things? Am I overthinking regular hardships? I know he’s drowning and struggling. But I want to have a family. I don’t know that he is mature. I don’t mind the money or the behavior or the contentious ex. I mind his character and reactions toward those. I feel awful. I miss him.",

I go to the gym 5 days a week, eat clean, and try to keep things together, but mentally I’ve been stuck in this constant loop of anxiety and self-doubt.\n\nThe part that gets to me the most, though, is women.

      "selftext": "I 31F regret that I didn't say no when I was 16 and my dad asked me if I was okay with him marrying his wife. They are roughly 39 years apart and at the time I knew it wasn't an ideal situation but I didn't want my dad to be lonely. As far as I knew he hadn't dated anyone since my mom died 16 years prior and even being a 16yo myself I had already known what loneliness was. \n\nI never expected us to be like Modern Family or anything like that and I never wanted a sister but now I'm just alone in my family. A short while after they got married my (much older than me) half brother told me that I should basically watch my dad's back and I did. Sometime last year I told my dad that I knew she had cheated on him and I provided the receipts. I didn't expect him to divorce her or anything like that but I had hoped it would better my circumstances in a way but nothing changed. \n\nI wasted my life watching his back only to realize no one has mine. I'm basically a house wife for my dad since his wife does what she wants. She comes and goes as she pleases, doesn't wash, cook (she cooks for herself) or clean, and doesn't even help bring in groceries. He is now retired and I am still required to do the housework, go to actual work and run his errands when he doesn't and I also help take care of my aunt (his sister) who is in a nursing home. \n\nOne day I looked up and realized I was the one under my dad's thumb even though I never wanted to be. I cannot maintain a romantic relationship because of where I live and I never even wanted to stay in the country I was born and raised but I did. \n\nI put all my focus into trying to protect my family's legacy, made all decisions with this knowledge in mind and now I've lost myself completely. I'm trying to move to another country now but the world is in chaos and nowhere feels safe. I don't even know what I want to do for work etc because I've been living in survival mode because of my home life and the way I've been treated. I feel like a lame person. Which other person is just looking to start life at 31? \n\nTLDR: I said yes when my dad asked me if I was okay with him marrying a girl 39 years his younger and now both he and her treats me poorly. I have completely lost myself because I put them above myself and now I don't know who I am. I am now looking to move out and start my life away from them but I don't know how to do that. ",

I’d meet new people, we’d get close, and then they’d just disappear or start acting strange, like someone told them something about me. They’d suddenly know things I never shared, or change their behavior right after I’d talk to my mom about something private. It started to feel like there was some invisible connection between what I say and how people around me act.\n\nAt first, I thought it was just coincidence.

I hate that I even think this way, but it’s hard not to when everything feels staged.\n\nNow I don’t trust anyone. I don’t know who’s being real with me or who’s pretending.

      "selftext": "I've been told that I don't fit in for quite a while now.\n\nIt started when I was around 9 or 10 years old. I still don't really know the reason why.\n\nI know that I was not really a child who was gentle, to be honest I was quite a energetic child. Doing mischief, but all those mischief some big some small where done with spirit of a child. Not with any harmful intent, not with hate or even anger.\n\nBut just today two of my own blood cousins told me that they hate me, and have been hating me for years.\n\nTelling me that I don't fit in anywhere, and they've just been putting up with me all this time.\n\nIn their own words \"Everyone pretends to like you\", which to be honest I see clearly in their behavior.\n\nWhen in family gatherings, I feel it. Room always shifts subtly when I enter. I feel the dislike.\n\nPerhaps that's one of the reasons I don't like family gatherings. It makes me feel suffocated and lonely.\n\nTrust me I don't feel lonely when I'm by myself. I can stay in my room and do what I need to do.\n\nAs a matter of fact I've stayed alone for an entire month just to complete a project.  \nDidn't feel a bit lonely during that time. I enjoyed every bit of it.\n\nSo you can guess that being alone is not a problem. But y'know it certainly hurts when you're in a room full of people but no one acknowledges your presence.\n\nI've never hurt someone intentionally, nor have I done anything that would make them uncomfortable.\n\nEven when said cousins team up and make fun of me when with other relatives. I certainly defend but don't have a revenge mentality of letting them go through the same thing I suffered. But I got told today that I need to be bullied.\n\nThat I need psychological counselling just because I tried to tell my opinion on something. I was told that \"I try to put my feet in everything\" and \"debate in everything\". I am \"too pushy\" and should just remain silent.\n\nThat I don't have a real \"personality\". There is this guy in our circle that has a really nice personality. I was told that I copied my whole personality from him.\n\nLook, whole time I was told these things I certainly didn't say anything that is hurtful to them.   \n  \nCause as Jesus said love even your enemies, of course even though they might hate me I don't think of them as enemies or hate them.\n\nI don't like them for who they are to me, but I certainly feel no hate.\n\nI told them this upfront.   \n  \nI know that you don't like me. I don't either but around other relatives at the very least don't show it.\n\nI know at this point I'm just telling you my grievances, but the main point is.\n\nIs being different such a big crime that even your own blood hates you?",

      "selftext": "Soo, I am an engineer working with a work visa in the EU. I arrived 3 years ago through an agency, and even though the agency is my legal employer, I work directly with another company (let's call it Company Great) so the agency is just an intermediary.\n\nEverything has been great, I love them and they love me (both agency and company Great ). My initial contract was for 3 years in hopes of converting to a direct contract with the company Great. At the end of my initial contract, a deal that was not guaranteed, but it is the way that a lot of people who work for company Great get in.  \nNow company great hasn't been doing well financially, so they are now under a hiring freeze, and they told me they won't be able to offer me a contract because of this. So when my contract ends in January, I'll be unemployed.\n\nAround this time, I found out I was pregnant (yaaay!). My husband and I had planned that when this would happen, we would go back to our hometown and I would leave my job to be around the baby at least for the very first months or maybe the first year, so we figured out that, given the circumstances (only one income), it would be better to go back to our hometown beofre planned. It is not ideal as the salaries for engineers there are definitely less for both my husband and I, not to mention I would be unemployed earlier than planned. We are very disciplined financially and have managed to save a decent amount, but it wouldn't be ideal.\n\nI was already making numbers and trying to figure everything out when my agency called me to tell me that even though Company Great is not hiring, they are very happy with me and would like to offer me another contract with another company client of theirs. I haven't told them I am pregnant and due in May, and in theory, it is not illegal for me to withhold information, and I am not obliged to tell them until 2 months before my due date, but if I do accept their offer, I would only work from January to April and then be on maternity leave and would resign after.\n\nIf I already had a contract going on with them or if I were to extend my contract with Company Great, I would honestly be ok with it. Becoming a mom is part of life, and society should allow us to decide if we want to continue working or not without any shame to it, but the timing is getting everything complicated, and even though I am legally protected, that doesn't mean it is moral or ethical.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that my maternity leave wouldn't be paid by the agency but through the employee insurance agency (a national benefit), so I wouldn't be affecting them financially but I would probably leave a project for some client unfinished, and honestly, 4 months is very little time to start fresh in another project.\n\nOn the other hand, if I accept the contract without telling them, it would allow both my husband and me 6 more months of double income that we could save up for when the baby comes, which is honestly a very good sum.\n\nShould I tell the agency I am pregnant, or should I accept the contract without telling them?",

      "selftext": "I (28f) have had a very tumultuous relationship with my mother since I was old enough to start formulating memories. She had, and still has, a myriad of personality disorders that led to some unbelievably unhealthy parenting choices for my sister and me. (If anyone wants specifics on some of the things she did/still does, let me know and I'll add to it, but for the sake of length, I won't do it on this initial posting.) I had a massive panic attack mid-2023 that led me down a path of serious anxiety and depression issues. I took LOA from work, met weekly with my doctor, and did weekly therapist/psychiatrist visits. It took a couple of months to develop a medication and coping mechanism system, but I eventually made some life changes and have been gradually getting better at managing my disorder. One of the main causes for stress in my day to day life is family, and my therapist, in lament's terms, recommended considering going low to no contact with at least my mother if I feel it would help my mental health. So, I began very low contact mid-2024 and have continued it up to the present. At first, Mom obviously picked up on my hesitance to respond to calls, texts, and visits. Lately, though, it seems like she's realized what I'm doing and has almost completely stopped attempting to contact me.\n\nI know a lot of people will think that 1. This is a response that I hoped for when I began this mental-health journey and 2. I shouldn't feel hurt that she isn't speaking much to me when I'm doing the same for her.\n\nThis is where my feelings are mixed. While I'm much less stressed and very relieved that I'm managing my stress and panic disorders better, I guess I'm just disappointed. I suppose I thought she'd finally realize that she'd pushed me to a breaking point and make even the smallest of changes in order to protect the fragile bond we still have. I know I'm an adult, but I feel like a little kid when I think about the situation for too long. Like, I wanted my mom to care about and love me enough to finally get help after all these years. To me, it feels like she's chosen to accept my pulling away while stubbornly refusing to outright acknowledge it just so she won't have to admit for the first time in her life that she was in the wrong.\n\nAnyway, that's all I really wanted to say. I know this isn't a therapy thread but I wanted to get this off my chest. Thanks for reading.",

But thanks for trying if you choose to. \n\nI'm 24F. I live in France. \nI'm currently dating someone, 22m. That guy is incredible, he saved me from my parents. \nI lived in a family where vi0lence was a daily thing. It started when I was around 8, my dad used to regularly b*at my mom and me... My brothers too. Regularly threatened to k- us over things like dinner made too late or just because he felt like it. \nIt was insults, hits, threats, guilt-trip, isolation...\nIt never stopped, i started missing school more and more to protect my mom until i dropped out at 17, a year before graduation. Got bullied at school for missing too much, tried to off myself a few times because I was terrified to be both at school and home. Child protective services got involved but my dad was a fucking narcissist and hid it so well I stayed under their guard.\nMy mom was a victim that ended as a bully too, she used me to h*rm herself, tried to off herself. She hurted me a lot too, today I barely trust them.\n\nWhen I was 20, for my birthday they threw me out of the house. And did it again when I was 22, a few weeks after meeting my boyfriend who took me in. (We started living together like two weeks after starting dating. I felt safer living with a stranger than with my family)\n\nI got diagnosed with PTSD and BPD When i was able to get medical help few years ago.\n\nToday, i got my life together, i have a job i love i became the person i needed to protect me. (I'm a proud security guard) \nI'm talking again to my parents, they changed a lot since they threw me out. (i cut ties for a good while when they did) Today we're in good terms i guess, they try to make amends by trying to help me financially but I don't want anything from them. \n\nConsidering my real issue... I'm changing my mind about being child free. I wanted that for so long... thinking i'd be a shitty mother. \nBut... My partner wants kids and I started thinking why not ? He knows how traumatized I am and says i wouldn't make the same mistake because I already know i don't wanna be like them, and I think he's right about that.\n\nBut god it terrifies me, i think about it everyday. I'm terrified i'll be like my parents one day, I worked hard to be the person I needed when I was younger. That person a kid would turn to to get protection.\nI'd love to be a mother one day, but I deal with traumas, anger issues. I tried therapy, didn't help much. \nMy partner helps me so much, he appease me when I'm going through something, knows how to bring me back when I need it. \nI want to be that woman, that good mother, partner. But it scares me to the core. It's hurting me, daily. And I have no one to talk about it. \n\nIf someone read it fully, thanks. I just needed to vent a little and it got awfully long in the end.\nHave a good day, whoever you are. ",

I've already done the time so I may as well do the crime. \n\nI can't leave him. We combined finances and now I'm constantly broke. My name is on the lease but I can't kick him out legally. My cat and car are registered to him. And I DO love him, when he's not being like this. He can be kind, sweet, loving and funny. But then he spirals and I feel like a trapped animal ready to chew my own leg off. \n\nI'm not looking for advice. I'm not actually going to cheat because all this has killed my s\\*x drive (which he says is ALSO sus, btw). I'm just gunna explode if I don't vent and I have literally no one IRL.",

My own father took me to a plastic surgeon when I was 16 cause he said I needed a nose job. When I got turned away for my age, I sobbed. I wanna get so much done.

But it’s been 5 year now, and were super comfortable with each other. Is it normal for someone to still feel shy about showing they’re in the mood even after being together this long?",

They said that they wished we could have also had this discussion over VC and wished they could have been a better friend so they could have thanked me in person for telling them how I felt. They told me also that I didn’t make them uncomfortable at all and that I hadn’t done anything wrong and thought it was sweet our friendship has progressed to a point where I feel that way about them. They ended off the response by telling me how they may not be the best friend or buff girlfriend I deserve, they still really appreciate and am glad I’m a part of their life however it might look.\n\nI’m hoping we can talk about it some more over VC like I was hoping to tomorrow, but I suppose I’m a little worried and nervous about where things are gonna go from here. I don’t want to rush things and maybe some of my nerves are me thinking I’m rushing but I don’t know.

      "selftext": "So basically I (30m) am gay and from a family who doesn’t believe in that “lifestyle” to put it kindly. I was outed when i was 19 and basically lost everything over night. My whole family was sent drunken photos of me making out with guys at a pool party basically, and yeah…\n\nI never was able to figure out who did it and really spiraled. My family kicked me out and i moved in with one of my friends at the time (now 35m then 24). He really helped me get on my feet and became one of the closest people to me. \n\nOne thing led to another and we basically started a romantic relationship, we ended up breaking up for different reasons a few years back and have been pretty off and on since and it’s been a bit of a mess but i guess i always had this white knight who saved me when i was down view of him so i let him off the hook easy. \n\nAnyway the other night we got pretty smashed at a party and got into an argument, I ended up going home with him anyway and we had one of those drunken over sharing moments. \n\nI’ve been emotional lately because i found out from one of my cousins (who still secretly talks to me) my brother passed and i just don’t have any closure, and none of my family even thought to reach out to let me know. I guess a part of me thought somehow they’d come around eventually, i know i should hate them but it’s complicated. I just wished things hadn’t gone down the way they had. I basically told him the same thing through tears and that’s when he dropped the bomb.\n\nI can’t remember word for word but he tried to argue my life’s better now that I’m out of the closet and I’d be miserable if i hadn’t come out and if i hadn’t gotten the push I’d still be living a lie. Something clicked in my brain and i asked him if it was him and he denied it but in a very not convincing way. We started to argue and he did end up admitting to it eventually but basically arguing he did it for me and he saved me and blah blah blah. \n\nHe always brings up the argument of how he took me in when i had no one and that’s always worked on me but now i find out you basically orchestrated that? Suddenly someone i viewed as a savior morphed into my worst nightmare in front of my face. Feel like I instantly sobered up and didn’t end up getting any sleep. I’m still sick to my stomach about it. I’m suddenly very afraid of the person, if you went that far to hurt me when you weren’t even mad at me what will you do if you are mad? \n\nThe next morning i could tell he didn’t fully remember what had gone down but seemed to be paranoid, like he remembered bits and pieces but wasn’t sure if he told me or not. I pretended i didn’t remember anything and went home, hes texting me the way he does when he’s anxious and im not responding as of now. I know i need a clean break from this person but….\n\nJust had to get this out there, and it’s easier to tell strangers at this point. I know my family sucks but if you arnt gay it’s hard to describe how bad being outed is, and how it can be dangerous sometimes. I should have been able to come out on my own terms and he took that from me. Also my whole family seeing embarrassing photos of me was the cherry on top. \n",

      "selftext": "It's a long read, but I have to get this off my chest. I don't have anyone to talk to about this. \n\nA little bit about our background bcs it's relevant : I come from a country with many cultures. My family is originally Asian but we are natives to our country. As a result, we aren't typically Asian bcs our traits are a mix of all those cultures here. His dad is my uncle, so he's from here and his mom, European. As a results, he grew up there so there's this slight difference in culture norms and upbringing. \n\nHe (29M) is getting married this week. He's from an European country, he found the girl of his dreams, everyone is happy, there's a new wedding in the family. And of course, everyone has forgotten what he did 3 years ago. \n\nI was 17 years old at the time and it was my brother's wedding. He was coming to visit us after many years following his father's death. I remember feeling happy to see him again for the most stupid reason ever: we share the same last name because my dad has only 1 brother. But it didn't go as I expected. Even since the first day, there was something off happening.\nI know some cultures condone cousin marriages but in my country, as is in most countries of the world, it's taboo. \n\nI noticed how he would always approach me whenever I'd be alone, especially whenever my parents weren't there. It looked so innocent; small touches, intense looks and even some slight flirtatious comments. Oh and kisses. Yeah. \n\nThis went on for days. I was dumb, I didn't know what to do. Maybe a part of me thought this was normal, maybe this is what he grew up with. Maybe it's also my fault for not putting clear boundaries too, for not pushing him away in time. Maybe if I did, he wouldn't have attempted touching me below the belt that one evening while the whole family was present. \n\nHe did it in the open air. No one noticed. I froze. He saw me sitting on the couch armrest, talking to my aunties and cousins. He sat on the couch right where I was sitting. Even today, I hate myself for not moving away and freezing. I was so shocked when he sat there, knowing that he must be doing it on purpose. His head, level to my chest and his hand slowly attempting to touch me. \n\nDo you love your underage cousin so much that you feel like you need to prove it by touching her thighs?\n\nThe worse part was thinking, I thought it was love. I thought I was in love. I was disgusted with myself and scared too and I'd cry for no reason. I knew deep down this was sick and that it wasn't normal. But I'd still be complicit in it. I wish I could shake my 17 year old self and slap some sense into her. \n\nWhen my parents learned of this, the damage had already been done. They told me to hide rather than not be scared of him and face him. Some time later, I also learned that the whole family saw it. And oh, since the golden family boy, he got away with it. Under the guise of my kind, innocent girl act was a sl*t, they said. Since it was my brother's wedding, I dressed up lavishly. As if it was a crime. I hung out with my two male childhood friends whom I haven't seen in so long. Another crime to them. So obviously for them, I'm the one at fault here. A girl who did things with her older cousin. Even writing this rn I want to puke. \n\nSince then, he always came to my home country every year. With time, I thought I got over it. I thought I forgave myself and grew up, which I did. And then, truth got revealed. With all the years he came, he didn't do this only with me. It was hard to learn that he did this with the underage girls in my family too. I healed and understood why it was wrong. \n\nAnd now, this guy is getting married. And I don't understand why do I feel sad. I feel both disgusted and sad. He got away with it, that girl he's going to marry knows nothing about this. I am conflicted and I don't understand what I feel. \n\nI'm perhaps still sick. A part of me wished he chose me instead. But I reserved the best part for the end. He didn't choose me because I am not good enough for him. I am light olive skin with brown eyes. His fiancee is fair with grey eyes. Maybe in terms of beauty standards, I failed. I'm back to being my insecure self I was at 17. \n\nTL;DR my cousin is getting married and I can't get over what he did to me when I was underaged.",

      "selftext": "About me: I am 34 years old, male, American. I have been epileptic since I was a child due to head injury at school. My step mother and father raised me locked in an empty bedroom with a Bible, and a bed from age 13 to 17 (i moved out at 17), along with letting my stepmother's family abuse and molest me. They randomly starved me if i didn't behave well, took away hygiene, and sent me to school hungry, and dirty to be bullied. \n\nI went no contact with my step mom and dad for several years...talking only to my mother...who died 6 years ago from meth. My seizures were down in amount, and I had an apartment, and was doing decent for awhile. \n\nMy situation, and how I got into it: about 2 years ago...I lost my apartment of 4 years to a corporate airBNB buy out/conversion of my apsrtment complex. Lost my job that same week due to a few days at the factory from my epilepsy.  \n\nThere were no apartments available in my hometown in wisconsin, so I moved into my van with my two orange kitties. I lived in the woods in upper michigan for a bit..managed to get a job, but i went completely broke, and stranded before my first paycheck. So i contacted my dad and step mom for the first time for a place to live. They let me move onto their land in tennesee. \n\nOver the past 2 years it has been constant screaming, my step mother constantly trying to find ways to stress me/ruin my life so she can drive me away while she abuses the several foster children she has. \n\nI finally snapped this week...after a lifetime of abuse, homelessness, and struggling with my healthcare, and support. I called out my parents for abusing children, and they immediatly want me off their land despite me having no food, no money, and no job at the moment while being stuck in rural...middle of nowhere...tn. \n\nI called the crisis lines...which triggered a massive cps investigation on my parents...who will find out i did it..and my parents are extremely aggressive, and mentally unstable, and extremely good at being manipulative/ruining lives. \n\nIdk what to do or where to go. Every crisis line, every shelter...even state health insurance in tennesee has turned me away simply stating \"we cannot help you. Have you tried a church or going back to wisconsin for better help?\" Only thing that happend from me calling the crisis line, adult protection services, 4 different organizations in my area...pretty much the only few resources they have here...was a massive cps investigation...which was needed...but further puts me in danger living on this land with my parents who will absolutely attack me for it.\n\nIve been trying for disability. Ive been working...even despite constant firings for missing a few days from my seizures. Been paying my parents thousands in rent over the years. Been trying to make a better life for myself...but I am officially stuck living with monsters. \n\nThis post is also a written statement...in case anything happens to me due to reporting my family for being abusive. I will be updating my reddit, and any other social media I create this week to pull in help, support, and public view of my condition as an american/single human simply trying to exist, and survive.

      "selftext": "Content warning for SH and ED mentions.\n\nI (24f) organized a move across the country with my friends. Friends I’ve known for 4+ years. I’ve lived with them before, and my partner is the only one that wasn’t as close to anyone in this group. There’s five of us in total, 3 women (including me) and 2 guys. Two couples, one single woman. All between 22-24.\n\nI feel like I live with ghosts. Shells of the people I trusted most. My partner and I got here 1 week after everyone else. Our coupled friends got the master, and our single friend got the second largest room in the house. Partner and I now live in the basement, in a 9x8 room. We can’t even sit in the floor it’s so cramped. It started a big fight upon our day of arrival.\n\n“We didn’t know, the rooms look the same size empty. But you guys just have to make it work.”\n\nThey don’t ask about my life. My job. Nothing. They finish series we start together without me, the girls do their makeup and do self care nights without me, and three of them will go out and get lunch/dinner together without inviting us.\n\nIt got to a point where we were left behind for a dinner with one of the roommate’s parents visiting, and we had been previously invited. They left without us. No text, no knock, no call. They all just left while we waited downstairs for any word on the plans. We texted, no response. Then we texted the groupchat.\n\n“Yeahhh we left. We thought y’all were busy. We can bring something home if you want ig.”\n\nWe talked about it, but nothing has changed.\n\nIt’s not lost on me that I’m the fat person in the friend group (200lbs). They’ve all been on a weight loss journey and I’m super proud and encouraging of it. But frequently, they talk about how gross it is when people don’t “take care of themselves” in reference to size/weight. They make comments about how disgusting they feel when they’re bloated. How gigantic they feel today. How gross their bodies look. And I sit there, hearing it all, while they talk like I’m not in the room. All of us have had serious mental health issues, including but not limited to SH and ED.\n\nI feel suffocated, constantly, in a house with people I thought cared about me. In a new city. 20 hours away from “home”. And every conversation I have is met with therapy-speak and zero nuance. Just, “Name a time we did ___. I’m sorry you feel that way.”\n\nAll our names are on the lease. Partner and I pay 40% of the rent. I feel completely alone, and honestly like people couldn’t give even half of a fuck about us being here. The only community I’ve ever had not treating me like a stranger that just helps with rent. It sucks.",

      "selftext": "The title basically. I won't go into detail to protect myself. \n\nExcept lately it has been persistent, almost constant thoughts about it. My life was horrible 4 years ago. Absolutely miserable. I was in a mentally abusive marriage but was able to get out of it. That was the first time in a long time I hadn't had thoughts of suicide. I felt free and in control. \n\nNow I'm going through it again because I'm realizing I've created such a strain on everyone in my life, including my kids. They have to go back and forth now because of me and they hate it. I've thought that offing myself would stop that and they'd be happier. I am the catalyst for so much unnecessary strain on the people in my life, despite it being unintentional. \n\nI have a wonderful, absolutely amazing SO that is way out of my league. I don't deserve them. I feel like everything happening in my life right now is just putting strain on them. \n\nMy parents have helped me through leaving my marriage but shouldn't have had to. I should have been able to provide a good life for my kids without help. Despite being employed full time and going to school I can't make ends meet on my own. \n\nIt's stupid, but the only thing that keeps me from pulling the trigger is being too chickenshit and my animals. They would be confused and wouldn't understand. I would just be gone one day. That's probably just chickenshit me finding an excuse not to. \n\nI have never told anyone about these feelings. I've made jokes but they were always rooted in seriousness but they don't know that. I can't tell anyone because they'll think I'm being dramatic or overreacting or that I'm being ungrateful. I'm just tired of being a drain on everyone despite doing literally everything I can not to be. \n\nLike I said, I don't have anyone to tell. Just wanted it off my chest because it's hard to get past today. I'm not looking for responses or sympathy, it just feels better to write it and put it out there. ",

      "selftext": "Hey guys, I (17F) just wanted to rant a little because my boyfriend (18M) is obsessed with this Roblox game called Evade. Ever since he found out about this game, he’s been on it for hours and every time I ask him when he’s going to get off to spend time with me (which rarely happens now thanks to this game), he tells me to wait but ends up not doing it. Also, whenever I ask him to hang out he just replies with one liners and says he’s busy playing Evade. This led me to find out he has a girl best friend named Leah, apparently he plays with a group of friends and she’s in it. I’ve also heard him on Discord calls with her one on one, and he doesn’t even hide it. Whenever I ask about it, he just says “she’s just a friend, chill..” I’ve asked him why he plays with her so often and he just shrugs and looks at me weird, saying “don’t be so insecure.” Anyways, a few days ago we were having our annual Friday night date, but when we were at the restaurant, he didn’t even talk to me once and just pulled out his phone to play Evade. I was so upset, every time I tried to start a conversation or ask him about something, he just shrugged and said “I don’t know.” It’s honestly getting annoying at this point. I’ve tried to be nice and even played the game, but he just says I suck and should just watch. I’ve tried communicating with him so many times but it’s always the same with him saying “you’re overreacting” or “it’s just a game, what’s the deal?” Honestly, I’m sick and tired of this. What am I supposed to do?",

      "selftext": "I’m really not sure what to do anymore. I have been with my fiancé for a pretty short amount of time a little less than a year. We had an amazing whirlwind romance… No love bombing or bullshit like that (been there and done that), but truly met him and just knew. This man I love is sweet, self sacrificing, kind, hard-working, patient and all around the most hilarious person I’ve ever met in my life. We’re best friends. I adore him. We have three problems right now: one, difference of religion; my philosophy on this has always been as long as we respect one another and communicate about expectations things will go pretty smoothly. Two, I haven’t been able to find a job for seven months… I am working part-time doing lots of odds and ends to make what I can, but I haven’t been able to find a full-time steady job… I don’t know how I don’t know why, I’ve done everything I know to do and none of it is working. Three, I snore like a trucker; this would be something to joke about except I’m pretty sure I have sleep apnea and my fiancé is a really light sleeper. We live in a one bedroom and I keep him up a lot. I’ve tried a lot of things, mouth tape, nose strips, etc. but none of it’s really working and I can’t afford to get a sleep apnea machine…\n\nNow, as far as the difference isn’t religion goes. We’ve been pretty chill about everything, I’m a Christian. I have a pretty intense belief because I almost died, and I had an experience with God that I could not question. He respects this, having also had a near death experience during which unexplainable things happened, but he is not a Christian. Mostly we’ve been okay, but lately there have been a lot of snide comments about me having Bible study with my friends or going to church or spending time in prayer. He’s just been saying stupid little things.\n\nAs far as the job thing goes, he’s really stressed about money like I am and doesn’t understand why we can plan a wedding, but I can’t get a job. He thinks it’s unreasonable and that I’m too focused on wedding stuff and not focused enough on getting a job. I can totally get that, but my dad is paying for the wedding, he’s been saving money for me since I was a little girl , and I’m just trying to be excited about something that is so special for me because I really didn’t think I would get married… But when you meet the one… also I really haven’t spent more time on the wedding than job searching, I literally spend as much time as I can applying for jobs… I have a degree and it’s literally doing jackshit for me rn… I applied for jobs at grocery stores, restaurants and every job IMAGINABLE and I’ve been rejected for being overqualified and all kinds of stupid shit. It is frustrating and I understand his stress, but I’m stressed too.\n\nThe sleep thing is the worst, it is extremely difficult because everyone needs their sleep, right? I feel terrible because it’s my fault and I don’t know what to do about it anymore… In our one bedroom apartment we have a weird seller type room that lives next to the kitchen… I think most people would probably use it for a pantry, but you can fit a bed in there, and so my fiancé bought a twin mattress and a twin frame and put it in there, we’ve been switching back-and-forth because it’s really not as comfortable in that little room as it is in the master obviously… But this weekend it was my turn to sleep in the main room, and I came out Saturday morning to find him on the floor in the living room, he didn’t say anything but essentially, I could see it on his face. He is exhausted and angry that this is the situation… Also, just so you understand you can’t wear earplugs because he has some PTSD and is afraid that he won’t hear if somebody breaks in the house…\n\nI feel like everything is my fault. I feel like I am a huge problem, not making his life better but making it harder, I’ve expressed this to him and he told me that I do make his life better but right now our “ machine is not running away. It needs to.” I am frustrated by the work situation. I am frustrated by sleeping situation and I wanna be left alone, I have every right to believe what I want really everything has been fine until this week, we’ve been… polite to each other, but I can see his disappointment, frustration, and anger at the situation. He’s been very careful to not put any of that anger on me, which I appreciate, but also doesn’t stop me from feeling absolutely guilty.\n\nI don’t wanna talk to my family or friends about this yet… Because I don’t want them to feel angry towards him… He hasn’t done anything really wrong to me and I’ve seen how venting about one’s partner can make relationships tense… I want to respect him as much as possible in this and understand that he is also feeling terrible and exhausted. But I’m afraid that we’re gonna break up because it’s too much… and I’m so sad and scared and heartbroken… I love him.\n\n\nTLDR: life is hard and I’m afraid my fiancé will leave me.\n\nEDIT: my fiancé has made it clear to me that he does want to get married, he’s just so stressed he can’t even think about it, which I get… I honestly haven’t been planning hardly at all…",

      "title": "I lied about my sexual past to my girlfriend, and now it’s poisoning our relationship..need perspective",
      "selftext": "I (25M) have been my girlfriend's (22F) boyfriend for approximately 9 months. Before that, I had a relationship with someone else, where I lost my virginity. We had been doing it, going on trips, staying at each other's places for about a week, she had been to my place, and finally, I got betrayed because she deviated from our plans.  \nMy current girlfriend and I never talked explicitly about our past sexual lives. Only a few indirect conversations occurred...for instance, she said she had never seen a dick and I didn't tell much about my experience. She is very possessive and hates lies due to trauma from a past relationship where she was cheated on. The thought of her being hurt or jealous if I did so made me not confess my past. I thought I would share with her once she inquired. I also postponed our sexual relations for a few months..giving her the time and space to ask if she wanted to know.\n\nWhen we eventually did it after seven months and she asked me one day if I was a virgin, I said I wasn’t but lied about the details. I told I had only one sexual encounter with my past girlfriend and it was messed up, and I downplayed the event, thinking that sharing the body count was sufficient and I don't need to share the details....after few days she starting asking more and more questions, I kept lying in order to uphold the lie I had already made. I was in so much fear and shame...when I realised I am doing wrong I decided to reveal everything....over two days, I slowly revealed more and more truth, and on the third day, at her place, I went into the full story of my past relationship and sexual experience. \n\nIn the last few months, I have been observing her reactions, and every time she used to get so jealous and stop me from talking, saying she is not interested in hearing when I used to mention other girls from my past. I thought that I was rather honest with her from the start, disclosing only a part of my past would suffice, I handled her jealousy mostly, and less of the complete truth because she was not interested, so I thought it was enough to tell her about my body count, I did not have to reveal the details.\n\nRight after that, she was very upset and angry because I lied…she said she’d have accepted me even of I haven’t lied but I was too scared at that time because of her jealousy. I had apologised over 1000 times explained everythinng tolerated so many insults from her. She said that the lie shattered the image she had of me..she had always thought that I didn’t lie and trusted me unconditionally. She is sorting things out now and she knows I’m not a bad person, but she keeps mentioning it during arguments. I experience the feeling of shame about the lie intensely every time it’s brought up, and my anxiety about it alters my behaviour to a degree which makes her even more upset. At that time, as well as later, I were acquainted with her past which was a bit deceptive. Her past sexual experiences comprised of oral sex, foreplay, and making out but not penetrative sex. For instance, she did a blowjob in the dark...strictly speaking, she had not \"seen a dick,\" but it was a little misleading.\n\nMy lie which I corrected eventually is the heart of the matter that keep on acting like a poison in our relationship. I was wrong to lie I was so scared to lose her..never had any bad intent. I was not doing this to hurt her, and I eventually came clean. Nevertheless, the shame, her trauma and distrust are still there especially when we are fighting.\n\nOn what grounds am I to rebuild trust with my partner and at the same time cope with guilt and shame? Has anyone else been in such a situation where only one lie from the past kept haunting the relationship even after total honesty? How can I not let this happen in our present and future days?\n\n  \n",

      "selftext": "\n(Sorry if its scattered, on mobile and am at work so sorry for any Grammer and spelling. Also may be a repost? I needed to read the rules so I hope this works )\n\nExactly as the title states. My work place makes me miserable. Its not even the job itself, I enjoy my work its easy to do and I am able to go at my own pace. I can work on my own as well as listen to music.\n\nThe issues\n\nThe pay sucks, like most jobs but I've been working at my company for 4 years now and make roughly a dollar more now than when I first started. New employees make more than I do and its frustrating.\n\nToxic work environment, my coworkers are seriously some of the most toxic people I have ever met. They constantly talk crap about everyone including eachother. There have been numerous times where me breathing wrong has set someone off. \n\nA few examples.\n1. They used to time my bathroom breaks (5-10 minutes depending if I had ate)\n2. If I talk too much they get upset and shun me.\n3. If I talk too little they get offended and shun me.\n4. I am currently being shunned because after being called a parrot by one particular mean lady, I retorted with calling her a mockingjay (I know, it wasnt the best but I thought it was all jokes). I have thus been shunned for the past month, silent treatment.\n\nThose were just off the top of my head. I'm miserable, I hate waking up in the morning to come in. I've of course been applying to jobs and have been fixing up my resume as much as I can. At this point I feel like I work in childcare as they act like children.\n\nSadly my company is very short staffed and those that give me issues have been at the company longer than I have. I know I need to just stick it out and wait to hear back from other jobs, I'm just so miserable.\n\nMaybe important info?\n\nIm 24f, full time college student while also working full time as well. \n\nIve talked to my boss about them previously, sadly he moved me to a separate area just to move the other ladies in there with me a few months later.\n\nI have been actively looking for a new job for about a year now. \n\nI have a hobby that I dip into in my free time with hopes for that to grow into a profession. But also know that I need to be realistic and is thus why I am still searching and working at my current job.\n\nI will gladly answer any questions, I am at work though so responses may be rough. Thank you for reading this mess. ",

      "selftext": "Our rental house has three rooms. One is mine, one is for a couple, Leah and Mary, and the last one was Clara with the master room. We are all girls in our late twenties. Clara recently moved out, so Leah and Mary decided to move into the master room. We also have another friend, Kate, who’ll be moving in soon to take Leah and Mary’s old room.\n\nThe issue is about the curtains. Leah and Mary’s old room still had a curtain and a curtain pole. The master room doesn’t have hooks for hanging curtains, and Clara left behind a bigger pole. I thought it would make sense to swap things around. I took the smaller pole from their old room, replaced it with the bigger one since their curtain could fit it, and then used the smaller pole in my room with a new curtain I just bought as it can only fit in the small pole.\n\nI didn’t tell Leah and Mary about it, only Clara (she came by). Thinking back, I know I should’ve asked first, but honestly I don’t even know why I didn’t. I just acted on impulse because it seemed practical.\n\nThen today, Leah and Mary took their curtain and the pole from their old room. I honestly thought they were leaving it for Kate, now I just feel awkward about the whole thing.\n\nNote: Leah and I are not compatible as friends. I’m mostly scared of her. She’s kinda passive-aggressive.\n\ntldr:\nI swapped my housemates’ curtain pole without asking because I thought it made sense and they weren’t using it. Now they took their curtain and pole back, and I feel bad about it.",

      "selftext": "Edit:\nGay or bisexual - since yeah bi men exist. But found out because he’s cheating via snapchat:\n\nit’s my (29F) birthday and my bf(31M) came to visit from Chicago.  He was going to drive me to FL to celebrate my birthday and help me move.  We were in a whole ass long distance relationship - I visit him in Chicago where he’s from and currently lives, he visits me on the southern coast.\n\nThere were possible signs - he struggles with alcoholism and financial issues, he’s kind of addicted to bl0w and says he has “demons” and internal struggles but I thought that was related to having a tbi from his time in the marines. Also when I went over to his old house in my current city where we met, he would have nights where he would sit downstairs not coming to bed.  I’m pornfree so was concerned he was on his phone watching porn even though I’m a very sexual person and he’s reassured me that he was pornfree too. So I’d go downstairs bcs I was waiting for him and he’d just be down there with his phone on his chest eyes closed maybe pretending to be asleep.\n\nWell a few nights ago after going out with him and a few of his guy friends I see a 🔥 notification from Snapchat - which he said he deleted - while he was drinking beer in my living room at 5/6am as I was trying to go to bed since he was supposed to drive us 4 hours next day.  This wasn’t cool because we had an agreement that there was no SC bcs he said SC is where the 403s are at and we were in a relationship.  He said to stop freaking out and the snap was from a guy friend who only communicates via Snapchat. I asked him to open the snap then, which he refused and said he was worried it was a d!ck pic.  Then I looked at him and asked “are you gay?” And he said no.  Then I asked why not show me then, what are you hiding I deserve to know etc.\n\nHe looked me in the eyes and said “I’m a horrible person and I’m a piece of shit” and walked out.  Posted about this to a local awdtsg page and one anonymous commenter said “he’s been seeing my brother” like going on dates and stuff. Not sure if that person was truthful but to me this would explain a lot and confirms he’s exploring outside our relationship.  So I drove to my bday destination alone and am celebrating alone and this isn’t what I had in mind.  I feel really stupid and manipulated and heartbroken.\n\nI fear that I’ve dated a few closeted men in the past and that’s why I went for a seemingly masculine guy (pro-gun, crazy about football and baseball) who pursued me obsessively. It is so frustrating to just lose someone you’ve been texting and talking to every day just like that.. Idk how anyone can trust a person again after being lied to so aggressively like that.",

      "selftext": "I used to be very confident as a child. I started to hate my appearance around like 11 because I was getting made fun of for my hair and being flat chested. (Obviously I was 11 so that wasn’t even like abnormal?) but yeah other things happened and I was really depressed and had to go on antidepressants. The first ones had awful side effects I lost clumps of my hair. I was also always skinny but gained a shit ton of weight and became overweight. \n\nI feel traumatised by when I lost my hair and became really fat. I was 14 at this time  and I would get made fun of constantly for the way I look. I basically became anorexic. \n\nObviously came off the antidepressants too which helped me lose weight I’ve lost like 50 pounds since I came off of them at 16 (now 18) \n\nI look a lot better now but I’m not beautiful and I feel like my looks fluctuate a lot. Even though my hair looks better now it’s still not the same. And even though I’ve lost weight and an in like the lower end of the healthy range I still look bigger than I actually am. Have a really noticeable double chin and I have a gummy smile.\n\nBefore starting college in September I wanted to make myself look as good as possible before then. I was going to get surgery on my gums and get my hair dyed with blonde highlights. \n\nThat wasn’t possible though. They said for me to get Botox instead and my parents were happy to pay for the surgery but not for the Botox.\n\nI was also unable to get my hair done because they changed their mind too. So I’ve been really insecure that everyone’s going to hate me for being so ugly.\n\nIt’s become obsessive. If my hairs not nice or I’m breaking out or looking puffy I will cancel plans. I’ve not gone to college today because my hair looks bad. And my face looks fat.\n\nIt literally makes me have a panic attack having to be around people when I look ugly. Because I think back to the bullying I faced. \n\nI have nightmares constantly about looking that way again. Or worse. Loosing my teeth. Gaining even more weight than before.\n\nI also have health issues. I’m supposed to be on medication for the health issues. But I won’t take them. I research beforehand the potential side effects. If weight gain is listed I will not take them no matter what.",

      "selftext": "Hey buddy,\n\nIt’s me here.\n\nIt might have been a long...... time. College wasn’t kind to both of us. We went through a lot..... especially you.\n\nIt’s been a long time since we last talked... a longer time since we last met. I don’t know if you ever think of me when you think of those years... but I want you to know, I do miss you.\n\nI miss spending time with you... miss your stupid, harmless jokes (especially the questionable ones, hehe)... I just miss you.\n\nYou deserved to hear this much earlier, but my poor mind only understands things when they’re already gone. Maybe it’s too late... but I still wanted to tell you this.\n\nYou were never wrong for caring as much as you did.\n\nYou were never wrong for expecting consistency, or for wanting to be treated with the same softness you gave me.\n\nWhat went wrong was how I handled your heart. Not because I wanted to hurt you....but because I didn’t know what to do with someone who saw me that clearly.\n\nWhen we first became close, I was drawn to you because you made me feel safe. You understood the little things I never had to explain. I liked the calm in your voice, the way you noticed what I didn’t say.\n\nI think I mistook that sense of safety for friendship... when it was something deeper ..... something I wasn’t ready to understand.\n\nI know I hurt you. Not with big fights... but with little things that added up. The silences. The mixed signals. The way I talked to others who didn’t deserve my attention. The distance that made you doubt yourself. A thousand small ways that make me feel like a terrible person when I think back.\n\nYou were there beside me every time. I can’t recall a single phase of those years where you weren’t my safe space. You trying to make me feel included. Your quiet smile. The inside jokes. The way you just wanted one small moment together .... a photo, a walk, a memory....and I kept pushing it away like I was risking something by being close to you.\n\nI pretended not to notice. You were so close, yet I kept a wall of politeness between us. I thought I was being careful... I was really just being cold.\n\nI called you a brother. I said it because I was scared. Scared of rumours, of what people might think, of admitting that you meant more to me than I could explain. Those words were meant to protect me... but they broke you.\n\nI sent you hugs through the phone 🫂... but never gave you one in real life. I could type affection, but I couldn’t live it. You deserved eye contact, not an emoji. You deserved a real gesture, not a message that disappeared in seconds.\n\nI remember laughing too freely with people who hadn’t earned it. Giving attention to the wrong ones. Hearing you go quiet. Watching you stand there, and saying nothing.\n\nYou never argued. You never threw it back at me. You just kept showing up.... with that calm voice and tired eyes.....still hoping I’d understand that there’s a difference between attention and care.\n\nYou offered depth. I answered with fragments.\n\nYou once said a hug would heal a lot... maybe it would have. But healing needs honesty, and I kept choosing safety.\n\nYou needed consistency. I kept offering confusion wrapped in kindness.\n\nI can’t undo any of it. It’s too late now, right? But I can tell you this, even if it’s years late...\n\nYou were never too much. You were just real.\n\nReal in a world where I was pretending to be brave.\nReal enough to love me when maybe I didn’t even like myself.\n\nThank you for standing near me when it hurt to stand at all.\nThank you for being the person who looked out for me in a crowd, even when I acted like I didn’t see you.\n\nI’m sorry. For every walk I didn’t take with you.For every seat I chose far away. Every time I made you feel replaceable when you never were.\n\nI hope wherever you are, when you think of me now, it doesn’t ache. I hope it just reminds you how big your heart truly is.\n\nAnd yeah... I did love you. I just never said it.\n\nAuthor's Note : \n\nSometimes, we have to imagine the apology... just to let the story rest.\n\nThis is me slowing down, taking one last deep breath... and letting go.\n\nTo Her : \n\nHey, if you're reading this I love you, God Bless.\n\n",

      "selftext": "Hello, I (F30) am wanting to post this just to really get my head around it and others points of view as I feel like im going crazy lately.\n\nAbout a year ago, I split up with the father of my 2 kids and around the same time my brother has split with his girlfriend and was travelling. I live out of town on a small mill with no neighbours except my parents and 3 other houses in the area. My brother came to stay, he was in a bad way, on alot of drugs and addicted to meth. I wanted to help him heal as I had the perfect place for him to stay and get back on his feet, mum and dad didnt really want to because he is a handful. \n\nAnyway he went though a few jobs and eventually got a new girlfriend while still living at my place, she lived 2hrs away in a remote area where he just got a new job. They dated on and off for a while I didnt see her that much but he did take me to her house and I met her family ect. \nUnfortunately she was the daughter of the ex president of the bikies and basically the drug lord of the area so my brother did not get clean maybe worse, and their relationship was extremely toxic.\n\nThey were going to break up and leave it as is so she came to stay at my place for the weekend while they did things together before their final goodbye. \nThe second night she stayed at my place, I asked my brother what they were up to tonight and he said they were going to hang out in the shed till late (i have a large 3bay shed) but she has to go home tonight because she has to be at work in the morning and thats 2hrs away, I was like okey cool and went to hang out with my ex who was helping me with the kids that day.\nA bit later on I noticed it was late about 11pm so I asked my ex to go home and as I was going to bed I seen my brothers girlfriends car was still here and I thought that was weird she should be gone by now and went to sleep. \n\nI woke up around 12:30 to the sound of a yell and a loud bang in the shed followed by my brothers girlfriends little dog barking it sounded like he was running and barking ( i always hear his girlfriend tell her dog to shut up and he is by her side 24/7) but all I heard was the barking then the dog got injured and yelped and then it was silence. \nI heard my son in the next room roll over and I was begging for him to fall asleep because I was expecting her to yell back or some sort of fight but nothing... silence... I thought, he didnt just kill her did he? \nI got up and peaked out the window at the shed but there was nothing that I could see but the lights on in the shed, I was going to go out but I was too scared because if he did and hes on meth who knows what he would do? So I went to call my ex and ask him to come back but then I was like nah this is ridiculous as if he done something like that? So I just decided to lay down and listen and wait to hear his girlfriends voice then I know she's fine. I layed in silence for about an hour but must have fell back asleep. I woke up again around 2 or 3 am to pee and forgot what happened. When I walked out of the toilet I noticed a small pool of blood in the hallway, I thought I was on my period and checked my pill packet to make sure and checked the kids rooms to see if they had been up or cut themselves but they were asleep but then as I stood there I felt I like i was being watched in the house... I shrugged my shoulders and layed back in my bed, a minute or 2 later I hear the back door click closed. I layed there longer listening and I heard my brother say something and I was like oh good hes talking to her she's fine.. then her car left... I didnt think that I should have waited her hear hers too not just him talking...\n\nThe following morning I forgot about it all like it was a dream. My brother came to me as soon as the sun come up and said that he had the best weekend with his girlfriend and they didnt fight and just had sex all night and kept talking about how good the weekend was, my ex come to take the kids to school for me that day so I stared working on a beanie I was crocheting. My brother asked me and my ex if we heard them in the shed having sex all night and that they were loud, my ex said no I didnt hear a thing and I said the same because I forgot about everything still sleepy. \nFor the next 3 or 4 hours my brother kept stopping me from crocheting and forcing me to look at this crystal he had and said he could see little characters in it to the point of me getting really irritated with him. \nAround midday that day he was like hmm I haven't heard from my gf yet thats weird... about 30mins later he started to look up her location on find my iPhone and snap chat, both having different times and places. By afternoon time he was calling the pub in the town she's supposed to be at and all her friends and family to look for her. He was using my phone, said his wouldn't call and was freaking out. He mentioned their night that night again at some point and I said no I didnt hear sex but I hear a loud bang, the dog barking and him yelping, I asked if the dog is okey and what happened because it sounded like he was hurt. My brother just shrugged and was like I dunno what your talking about and continued calling people. A bit later he sat in the room with me i just straight out asked \"did you murder her\"? He lost it saying why would I say that and I said you look suss asf this is all suss and it was a bit of a fight. \n\nThe next day around midday his gfs brother txts my phone that she had died in a car accident. Her time of death was around 5 or 6 am the night she left my house. \n\nWhen the txt came through my brother had a full mental breakdown i haven't seen anything like it and shaved all his hair off, hysterical. I comfortated him all day until he passed out while still sitting up. I apologised to him for accusing him of killing her and I felt really bad at the time but it still felt like he was breaking down because of what he had done.\n\nI noticed about a day or 2 after her accident that he had and injury on his left lower calf, I pointed it out and asked him what happened he was like oh you know i just do lots of stuff, I said it looked like a dog bite with two teeth and was deep into the fat and he just shrugged.\nAbout a week after, one of his girlfriends friends was the only one in contact with my brother and she sent photos of the crash site. The dog survived with broken ribs. Before getting any of these he was like oh I bet the dog survived.. was kinda weird.\n\nHe hasn't contacted any of her family or see anyone since she died. Ive offered to take him wherever he wants but hes avoiding it. Its been about 2 months now, he still doesn't talk about how he misses her he only talks about how suspicious the crash was because she's in with the bikies and he thinks she faked her death and said they always fake car accidents. He has spent all his time since cleaning my shed spotless and smoking meth. \n\nIm putting this here because my brother is still living with me and I dont know how to feel or what to do. Ive been playing dumb this whole time acting like I believe its just an accident because im actually pretty scared of him. I told my mum and dad all of this they haven't done or said anything... my dad said that the first thing he thought when he heard about the accident was \"He didnt kill her did he\"? He had these suspicions because hes told us before that he felt like my brother was going to kill him and my son while out gold detecting in the past but we didnt take him seriously.\nMy brother does not look like he is on meth, is good looking and he is very good at manipulation.\n\nI have went into the police station crying my eyes out and told then this whole thing but because I have no evidence its just a non suspicious accident. \nIve aslo seen detectives and told them hes cleaning the shed they said they wont apply for a warrant without evidence and had them see my ex for questioning to proove he seen her car at my house that night around 11pm. I have not heard from them since. They made me feel crazy. I have no evidence for any of it. Two of my best friends came with me to the station, we are all pretty shocked that nothing is really going to happen. They would have had to request to dig up her body as I went in about a week after the insisident. They pretty much told me I will only hear from them if they get any evidence or video footage of him driving her car that night, thats pretty much impossible as we are remote. \n",

Still, just in case, I added a little \"as friends\" when I told a colleague at work we should try out the Indian restaurant.\n\nAnyway, Indian food is good.\n\nThe awkward situation with the woman that got all touchy has also been solved. I sent a message telling her I was there for food and was sorry if I led her on, it wasn't my intention. After some days of silence, she replied back and said she was okay with it. We had a conversation, and I told her plainly I value her as a friend and if she was still down for food and just food, I wouldn't mind going out to eat again with her, without the whole going home shtick. She was okay with it, we were down for Japanese.\n\nAnyway, sushi and sashimi are good.\n\nThank you everyone who chimed in and provided insight in the previous thread, it helped.",

      "selftext": "I (20f) have been dealing with a tough menstrual cycle since I first got it as a 13y/o.\nThe problem is my symptoms where much easier to deal with with only school hours and constant access to rides. Now that I'm in college, it's been harder to keep up. In my country we don't live at universities, we go everyday from home, as they are not as far or isolated like in other countries. I take the bus or subway and take around 1 to 2 hours daily if traffic's not bad. I'm also an industrial design mayor, so I'm usually carrying materials around and my shortest classes are like 3 hours long. So if I where to have 1 class thats like 5-7 hours of my day, and I ussally have 2 + time to work on the assignments in the machines and programs that are only at the uni.\nAll this to say, it's a lot heavier now, and its been a lot harder to keep up with the level of energy demanded. \n\nI've been to the ER multiple times from the pain alone and been tested for endometriosis, uterine cancer (don't know if i translated that correctly but anyways), STDs, etc. They all come back negative and my cycle is now evaluted as \"within the norm\" wich sucks as a categorization cause last month I had a hemorrhage and needed to be tested for anemia, so I don't think it should be taken this lightly, especially since it happens to a lot of people. \n\nEvery month I suffer through at least a week of pms wich is misserable, I tremble and sweat, I'm hurting and bloated and tired and just all around terrible. Some days I can't even get up or cry from the pain.\nThen I get periods that last a minimum of 7 days, up to 2 weeks, with a heavy flow so bad I have to wear senior incontinence diapers just so I don't damage my clothes or get irritation scars on my legs. And don't get me started on my emotional stability going to crap with hormones and self image problems.\nEvery time I look in the mirror in these periods I fell like a stranger. I feel bloated to the point I look pregnant, I have painful acne, my face swelles, my chest swells, I get bad headaches that convined with sometimes being anemic, makes me look sick. I hate perceiving myself as this disgusting, sickly stranger that cries all day and is constantly overwhelmed and moody, every month for 2 to 3 weeks.\n\nI have to build some confidence and self love for the rest of it every month but it always falls down in I'm so tired of this internal battle.\n\nI've been to so many doctors and multiple ER visits and no one seems to take me seriously.\nI'm on inyectable birth control since I'm 15, which was recomended to me to control this, but it doesn't help all that much, and I'm planning on switching, so I have even more doctors appointments to go to.\n\nI just don't like cringing in disgust at my own image, it makes me cry so much and it's come to the point I became such a bully to myself.\n\nWith how the medical world treats women I just don't know if it will get treated more seriously, I'm getting hopeless. I am on therapy and working on this but it's just so sad that there isn't a definitive answer. I'm sad I don't get to feel normal when I'm expected to do normal things and hours of work and just don't know if theres much I can do but to keep going.\n\nDoes anyone have a similar experience, would love yo know I'm not alone. Thnx🩷",

      "selftext": "I’m just lonely all the time, and it sucks because I’m always in a house with people. I’m a middle child, I live with my older brother and younger sister along with our parents, and I can never have a conversation with any of them without feeling like it’s forced. And before you ask why I don’t just go out and talk to someone, I can’t. I don’t have a car, I do online school, I live where a walk to town would be hours. Sometimes I get so lonely I just have to sit there with my thoughts, and the only thing I really I get from that is a reminder that I can just kms so I won’t keep feeling like this. I know it’s a big leap, but it’s exhausting to keep myself distracted all day. And anytime I don’t do something or I don’t want to hang out with my siblings, I’m selfish and rude. I’m so tired of being told that. Anytime I want to even TALK to my brother all he says is “go away you’re annoying.” “Go away, quit nagging me.” “Stop getting in my business.” I ask one question and suddenly I’m nagging, I point out one thing IN FRONT OF MY FACE, I’m getting in his business. But he can wake me up at 12 AM so I can kill a bug for him. And don’t even get me on my younger sister. I’ll ask if she wants to hang out, she’ll say no, that’s it. But if she sees me in the kitchen or if I’m sitting in the living room and want to go back to my room or don’t want to be with her in that moment, she’ll immediately say, “so you just hate me?” “So you just me to die?” Which is fine and just joking, until you realize when I make those same joke she yells at me “STOP GUILT TRIPPING ME” so pretty much everyday I’m left alone while they do their own thing until they need me. When I almost died from an attempt, they said they’d never leave me or let me get that bad again. Now my brother talks to me like all I am is an annoyance and my sister says “At least I didn’t try to off myself” (she used to harm herself but she’s been clean for a year now, so proud of her) I attempted over two years ago, and they both still bring it up. My brother is mad that I yelled at our mom while she was fighting me to see my wrists (I understand why she did that and me and her are closer than ever) I’m just tired. I still hurt myself sometimes just so I can feel a little less lonely and think about anything else but being alone. I’d rather be hurting myself again because it gives me a different feeling than the loneliness I feel like I’m constantly drowning in while rotting in my bed and doom scrolling. I’m so tired of always being people’s last choice. I was forced to cut off pretty much all of my friends from a messy breakup I had, and the only friends I have now are either online or always busy. I know I’m probably just being dramatic and need to get over it, but it’s just how I feel right now and needed to let it out.",

      "selftext": "Recently caught up with my ex boss over coffee to see if I could get hired again, and had complicated feelings. For context, he was my boss while I interned at the company. Of course I had a teeny crush on him while I interned; he was smart, funny and very charismatic. I also admired him for the way he treated other people and especially how much he loved and talked about his wife (who is also very successful, love that for them). Obviously, the feelings were one sided, and it was a work crush lol, I didn’t enjoy work and I needed a reason to get up early, look polished in the morning and do my work well.\n\nAnyways back to the present, I don’t have feelings for him anymore, of course I have admiration but it is slowly waning into an honest glance at both his strengths and flaws.\n\nI have been thinking about him and his life, partly in jealousy because I want a complete life like that, like I want to be high functioning and also be married to someone like that, but I just couldn’t place my finger on why I was thinking about him this much. My midnight revelation is that I kinda sorta wish he would see me that way. Obviously, I don’t even care about him that way anymore but it feels like it’s some sort of pathetic cry for attention idk. \n\nI was the other woman in an emotional cheating situation before and I felt terrible afterwards, so I’m not sure why I’m even thinking about this.\n\nI guess this entire story was to say that while I know an affair would never go anywhere (definitely wouldn’t ever go through that emotional cheating situation ever again, and would never put anyone through that again) and therefore never make me happy (as I truly want a supportive, green flag for a partner), I’m not sure why I secretly want attention from someone who’s taken.",

      "title": "I just need to vent",
      "selftext": "I desperately need to vent and I think this might be the best place. My deepest apologies for if this is long but I need to get it out and I feel like I can’t talk about it to anyone else. I barely know where to start and I’m using this to organise my chaotic thoughts on everything going on right now.\n\nSo, I (F27) started a relationship with my boyfriend, P (M28), at the end of May, going on almost 5 months now. I have never been with someone so kind, compassionate and understanding. He is a true gem in this world and I love him so much. I feel so blessed to have found him. I fully see myself marrying this man when the time comes and we’ve discussed what our future will look like. I appreciate it is early for this sort of talk, but I don’t believe in societal timelines. When you know you know, ya know? \n\nThe thing is, he has kids. A (F5) and C (M2). I don’t have a problem with this. It’s unlikely I’ll get to have kids of my own due to chronic conditions and PCOS, and I’ve made my peace with that. I consider it a blessing to get to be a part of these incredible kids lives. However, 5 months in, I still haven’t met them. I’ve spoken to them on FaceTime many times and built relationships with them, especially A, but never met them face to face. This isn’t because P doesn’t want me to, but because his ex, the kids mother, won’t let me. \n\nSophie (real name because frankly she doesn’t deserve anonymity) is a real piece of work. The whole circumstance of how their relationship ended is messy. P hadn’t felt happy for a couple years at that point, and then she out of the blue ended it, told him to leave that day, and moved a new boyfriend in 2 days later. It’s suspected she was already cheating with this guy before the breakup but it can’t be proven. The kids took it really hard and were not happy around him as a stranger. A took it especially hard and wasn’t in a good place mentally when he was there. Sophie didn’t seem to care that her children weren’t comfortable (this is a recurring theme). Their relationship ended after 5 months and only lasted that long because she seemed to want to prove a point to P that she didn’t make a mistake.\n\nSo then P met me, and we chose to be respectful of Sophie and ask for her permission for me to meet the kids after we’d been together for a few months and were pretty secure already, a respect she didn’t extend to P with her relationship. We also introduced me slowly with mentions to the kids and FaceTimes so they would be comfortable when the time to meet me came. Sophie refused for me to meet them. Kept pushing it back with excuses. But we respected it and went along with it to not cause problems.\n\nThe thing is, Sophie is quite horrible to P. The whole time we’ve been together I’ve seen her be manipulative, vindictive, and down right petty just to spite him. This is all for no reason. She kicked P out to move her new boyfriend in, she chose to not be with him anymore, and has made it everyone else’s problem. P’s mum told me that she never liked Sophie because of how rude and nasty she is, as has P’s brother and sister. Sophie is known in the community as being a shit stirrer and her family is known for pretty much being Karen’s. If Sophie can cause trouble for anyone, she will go out of her way to do it. She regularly would verbally abuse P, just because she could, and he was so used to it he let her.\n\nSo, Sophie said I could meet the kids after half term so they could settle into school before their routine was ‘disrupted’ by me coming in. How this would disrupt them, I don’t know, but we respected it. When half term came, she decided to start world war 3. She decided to pick a fight with P in the school playground for no reason, and he finally told her to stop talking to him the way she has been. In response she continued the argument over text message, threatening to cut his contact with the kids (a threat she has played many times to get him to comply with her demands), saying meeting me was out of the question now. He replied that she couldn’t do that, and he was done being respectful and I was meeting the kids whether she liked it or not. In response she denied him access to the kids. \n\nNow, she has attempted this before, but caved within a day because she couldn’t cope on her own. P is very involved you see. He FaceTimes the kids every morning and evening, has them Tuesdays and Thursdays, and weekends, every week. Anytime they play up at Sophie’s, she calls P to sort it. He’s a constant presence in their lives and I’ve never seen a more devoted dad. So many fathers split up with their partners and then don’t bother, or see their kids every other weekend, and it’s part of why I fell in love with him to see how present he is and how much he cares. We thought Sophie would cave. She didn’t this time. \n\nThe night of the blow up, she allowed A to FaceTime P at her bedtime as per usual. At the time, we were out to dinner because he was upset and he needed cheering up, so we went out with P’s best friend, H (M28). During the phone call, A told me that she loved me and couldn’t wait to meet me in person. She’s a kid, I couldn’t hear that and say nothing, and I have formed a bond with her and I do have love for her, so I said it back and said someday we’ll bring her out to the restaurant we were at (she said she wanted to come before I said this). Later that night Sophie sent a text saying “that thing will have nothing to do with my children and is never to make plans or tell the kids she “loves them””. She also said she’d only reconsider if I provided an enhanced DBS check, a drug test, and proof that I was safe to be around children. She told P that clearly his priority is his girlfriend and he doesn’t give a shit about his kids because he went out without a care instead of fighting for his kids (baring in mind we called a solicitor to start a legal process that day after she blocked him and said his contact was cut). \n\nHe was distraught that whole weekend without them. On the Monday I encouraged to ask her if he was still having them Tuesday as per their agreement. She replied that he couldn’t, and then had a go for him not being in contact with the kids all weekend. But he was blocked and she unblocked him without telling him and made that his fault? How was he supposed to know? She said “I said you couldn’t see them, I said nothing about phone calls”. But she actually said “don’t contact us” so she kind of went back on herself to make him look bad. She then said that she’d spoken to legal advice and been given a document that was a parenting plan. If P signed it, he could then have the kids.\n\nThe next day he went to read the ‘parenting plan’ that he had no input in, and it was a poorly written document that was basically a list of demands. It stated that P could only contact her within set hours a day, could only request visits on his specified days (the ones previously mentioned) and I was specifically named as not being allowed near them in any way, shape or form. However, it stated she was allowed whoever she wanted around them, she could contact P whenever she wanted, and could palm the kids off on her days whenever she wanted (which she already did regularly). It was very one sided. And obviously written by her. P filmed the whole interaction for protection, told her he wasn’t signing it, it wasn’t an official legal document as it was described etc. she basically committed fraud by saying it was given by her ‘legal advice’. She then called her ‘legal advice’ (which turned out to be her mother) screaming down the phone “what can I do” to which P said “legally nothing because ive done nothing wrong. She said if he didn’t sign the document, he wouldn’t see the kids again, she’d move far away so he wouldn’t know where they are, and she’d spread lies and say he was violent towards them to everyone they know. Basically blackmail. She also refused to let him take the document with him to consult his own legal advice and sat right next to him as he read it. Just all quite illegal. She was screaming and acting like a lunatic after he refused to sign and A was quite distressed, crying and covering her ears while P was very calm, basically telling Sophie she was only acting this way because he didn’t do what she wanted. After she threatened to call police for violent behaviour, he revealed he was filming, which is where her face dropped and she started swearing at him in front of the kids and generally throwing a tantrum because she didn’t get her own way and realised her behaviour had shot herself in the foot.\n\nIt’s been 2 weeks since then. She hasn’t answered any messages, hasn’t let A answer FaceTimes on A’s iPad, and there’s been nothing from them. P is so depressed at this point and I don’t know what to do. His depression is bringing me down (we both have mental health issues and are medicated for it). He’s noticed and has expressed he thinks it’s him that’s bringing me down but I lied and said it wasn’t him. I just think right now isn’t about me (despite how hurt I’ve been by the things Sophie has said about me, the things she’s called me and how she’s dragged me into things). I’m not the one who’s had my kids taken away and I don’t want to add to his plate. I can’t tell him that he is the one bringing me down. I can’t be that burden right now.\n\nP is worried the kids will start to hate him, or forget him because of how long he’s been without them. I don’t know how to comfort him. We have an appointment with a solicitor tomorrow afternoon, the soonest we could get in. We plan to fight for full custody. The thing is, Sophie is quite a neglectful parent (yet another complication to this whole thing). She’s petty and spiteful and doesn’t care if that harms the kids. She regularly shouts at A, favours C. She makes A take on caregiving duties for C because Sophie “can’t be bothered”, including making them both breakfast, sorting bathtime etc, things 5 year olds shouldn’t be made to sort out, all because Sophie would rather sit and vape than look after them. She doesn’t play with them, she won’t hug them. A once said that she feels so lonely when she’s with her mum because she’s often discarded in favour of C and Sophie refuses to hug her. She’s also said, and I quote “mummy makes me worry” because of how Sophie talks to her and shouts at her all the time. She’s openly stated she doesn’t like her mum and wants to live with P when she’s older and Sophie can’t make the decisions (I think A has to be 11 or something to make that decision to live with P?) There’s no evidence of physical abuse, but A freaks out into hysterics anytime she gets told off for anything, which makes me think maybe Sophie is hitting her or something, because A’s reactions are just so extreme. She isn’t allowed to do extra curriculars, not because they can’t be afforded (P offered to pay for them), but because Sophie can’t be bothered to take her. A is so unacclimated to social situations because of this. It’s sad to see. She also doesn’t feed them properly. She gives the kids a sausage roll from Gregg’s or a pack of super noodles and considers that dinner, feeding them nothing else. No protein or nutrients or veg. She then claims that they don’t have appetites. But the kids get to P’s house and eat several helpings of proper meals, plus snacks, because they’re so hungry.\n\nTheres more with Sophie. H once saw that Sophie was tracking P without his knowledge through headphones after their split. P had given A his old phone so A could contact him and then found out Sophie was snooping through all his messages and emails and things, he only figured it out after she seemed to know things he had only sent in messages to other people and after the tracking came to light. Recently we found that she had set up a NowTV account using his bank card for the last year without his knowledge so we had to make a fraud claim and cancel his card. This will all be brought up to the solicitor tomorrow.\n\nHer initial hostility I assumed was jealousy. I also thought she wanted P back, because she would tell him all about the guys she was talking to and stuff as though she was trying to make him jealous. I still think this is the case. She’s insecure. She realised I wasn’t going anywhere and that’s why she started all this. I’m not concerned that P will go back to her. I’m not the jealous type and I know that he loves me. He told me a few weeks ago he’s never felt so loved, wanted, and cared for. He’s never felt so supported. He cried and gave me the biggest hug when he told me that. I also know he has grown to truly hate Sophie because of her behaviour and the things she’s done. He tried to be amicable with her for the kids, but after her threats, her demands, the way she talks to him and recent events, he now cannot stand her and moving forward only wants to have contact about the kids and nothing else. I’m secure in my relationship. And Sophie hates it. My name popping up 3 times in her document is more proof that that is her motivation. She’s allowed a love life but P isn’t. If she can’t have him, no one can. Shes trying to make me leave him, she wants P alone. He thinks she wants him to commit suicide by taking everything he holds dear away. \n\nI know this is super long at this point, but I just don’t know what to do anymore. P has lost all hope of winning the case. She’s really brought him down and he’s cried every night the last week looking at pictures of the kids. I know it’s still early in our relationship but I would do anything for the 3 of them. I just needed to get this off my chest and vent. I don’t know what I’m looking for here. Sympathy? Advice? Reassurance? If anyone has been through something similar, advice would be appreciated. I’ll also accept any criticisms if you think Sophie is warranted in any of her behaviours towards me, I understand she may be being protective, but it’s just so extreme and fuelled by spite.\n\nIf you’ve made it this far, thanks for reading and letting me get this out. I feel lighter just having typed it out. There’s probably stuff I’ve forgotten to say but I’ll leave it here.",

I blocked her after I sent the last text because I’m honestly just tired of her shit. At the very least I left feeling like the bigger person.\n\nMe: Hey so you came into my work and told my coworkers that I ruined your life? What were you even trying to accomplish with that? I’ve done so much for you guys and never asked for anything in return, like helping you move, driving you places, getting you food, helping you when you just got out of surgery, jumping your car and helping Emily get the battery for said car. I don’t really feel like any of that is ruining your life. As far as im aware you never reached out to me and I never reached out to you so it was a mutual parting, then you said something about how Jayden stole me from you? I am not anyone’s property and shouldn’t you be happy for me for hanging out with people my own age? Instead you’re mad and that’s not very mature. Please do not come into my workplace again especially if you’re going to say shit about me to my coworkers because guess what, nobody there wants to hear it and not a single person there agrees with you. In fact they know to look out for you now. I didn’t ruin your life, your behaviors and actions ruined your own life.\n\nHer: Oh sweetie. You ghosted me, like when you're done with a guy and you just disappear. There was never closure as to why you fucked off. The fact that you couldn't be mature enough to just be cordial was fucking ridiculous. You RAN out off the floor like a guilty bitch who knows they have fucked up. I would not have made a single comment if you simply just did your goddamn job. You have the emotional maturity level of a goldfish. Don't worry, I won't be back. I'm sure you texted Jayden before we even left. Good riddance and good luck. And stop ghosting people bitch.\n\nMe: You’re right, I didn’t owe you a dramatic ending. I just quietly removed someone who drained me. You coming to my job to throw a tantrum only confirmed it was the right choice.",

During the recovery I noticed a small bump on my right chest but didn’t think much of it figured it was a muscle that somehow got hit during my work injury since my entire right side was affected. This was in July fast forward to a few weeks ago and the lump is huge, to the point it’s weighing the breast down visibly. I have my initial appointment on the 29th but I’m scared af.\n\nI’m a mom and I’m helping my own mom out. Breast cancer also runs on my dad’s side of the family so that isn’t helping my fears. I did talk a medical professional friend via ft and showed her my chest to see the size and gave her the symptoms I’ve been having and othering info about the lump. It’s big like really big now only 3 months later. During the call she noticed the one in the left I told her it’s just calcium build up bc that’s what my mom deals with and it’s not as big but her face said otherwise after I explained that one too.\n\nShe made me schedule an appointment for a women’s wellness check since I’m under 40 and can’t just requested a mammogram and biopsy without a referral. I’m nervous definitely have fear due to the unknown and the information she gave me such as looking in to wills and treatment options I might be comfortable with but I’m not anxious which is confusing bc I’m diagnosed with anxiety and depression. I feel at peace internally but mentally fearful it’s confusing.\n\nI’m also stressing bc I don’t want to be sick, I just got somewhat better, finally walking without a cane and not on so many meds anymore. I want to be healthy and active to play outside with my toddler, I’m also freaking out bc I have a heart condition and an autoimmune disorder which makes any type of chemo basically impossible unless I live in the hospital.\n\nI’m just idk, and the few friends and family that know I don’t wanna go to them about this they already give me pitty looks, and my sister (love her but man) she made a joke and called me “lumpy titties” idk it hurt more than normal. I’m use to her making insensitive jokes based on things I can’t control like me being forgetful (head trauma from the injury) me not hearing how loud I am ( can’t really hear in one ear) and being “slow” (I’m autistic). Live just seem harder and harder the older I get and I’m at peace but also over the hardships. When can I just breathe?? No issues no problems just breathe and have a normal stable good life ?? Am I not meant to??",

      "selftext": "I made mistakes when I was younger (early to mid 20s) and was a toxic, abusive person during that time. \n\nI believe that my undiagnosed autism, undiagnosed ptsd and adhd, and prior abuse from my parents were factors as to why I was like this. Please know that I am not saying that these excuse what I did. I think they explain them, not excuse them. \n\nThings to note about this are that I only remember one incident where I hit my ex on the arm with a cell phone that was in my hand. I remember being horrified by the fact that I'd done that and I felt horrible. I remember other incidents of us yelling, but I don't remember what even started the arguments or why I would engage in such behavior. It seems very unlike me, and I don't understand why I didn't just break up and leave them long before I got sick. \n\nI haven't seen my ex in 6 years since I moved hundreds of miles away to live with family again. Between the argument where I hit them with a phone and when my parents picked me up from there, there are 2 years where my mental health was terrible and I became a shut in and was dealing with an eating disorder and severe agoraphobic behavior. I tried to kill myself at least once. Leading up to that, I had an extremely stressful job and I essentially cracked from that and nearly two years of my life remain largely inaccessible to my memory. \n\nThe last time I talked to my ex over email, I apologized for being toxic and I told them the good things in my life now and how I appreciated the good memories I had of them and that I was sorry for any possible lasting trauma. My ex became very angry in the next email and listed everything abusive I had ever done to them, and much of what they mentioned were things I don't remember doing. I remember hitting with the phone and yelling. They said I also forced them to buy things for me and take me on trips and that I used my mental illness as an excuse to do those things. They said they never want to talk to me again and I won't because I clearly traumatized them. \n\nI've taken steps to deal with emotional regulation and sensory overload. What disturbed me about what they said is that I have no memory of abusing them over a long period of time like that. I don't understand how I could spiral so badly and do things that I don't remember. \n\nI worry that I'm a bad person or ill and that I could hurt others again without remembering or wanting to. I do remember my ex getting on my nerves, but I don't currently treat people that way and haven't since then. I didn't realize how bad of a person I was to them. And I don't think that them annoying me could have excused anything I did. Up until that email where they told me what I did, I had no memory of doing those things at all and I had remembered the fight with the phone as a one time thing that I'd worked hard at never repeating with anyone ever again. \n\nI wish I had an explanation as to why I can't remember two years of my life when I wasn't drinking or doing drugs.\n\nI do remember tiny snippets of that period of time, but the things I do remember in those two years are blurry and don't feel vivid at all. I believe that I was a bad person. It hurts that I was bad, and it's strange that I can't remember it. \n\nI take anti-anxiety medication and go to therapy now, and I'm very careful and intentional with my feelings. I also do my best to keep stress levels down. I have had a happy relationship for 8 months, and we've handled disagreements civilly. I can't imagine doing anything like what my ex said I used to do, or snapping like I did at 24ish, but I still feel terrible and evil deep down and like I don't deserve happiness. ",

But we got a cat recently, and she cannot bear the sight of closed doors or she'll meow forever, so we just keep them slightly open.  So every once in a while since we got her, I'll do my 4am pee, walk by his room, and get accidentally flashed by him because clearly he sleeps naked and the cat pushed his door fully open.  And it was kinda funny the first few times, but it's getting kinda stupid that it's still happening, and I realized he probably has no clue anyone (me) has seen him.  He doesn't know about my 4am bathroom breaks, so from his perspective, he probably just wakes up, notices the door is fully opened, thinks \"eh whatever it's not like anyone would've walked by\", and then keeps sleeping naked.\n\nSo I don't exactly know how to communicate this to him without directly telling him he's been unwittingly showing me his dong.

      "selftext": "First time poster, long time lurker of Reddit story reading podcast, but I just gotta get this out there because I legit will tell no one in my real life about my marriage. Y’all I don’t even know where to start. I’m emotionally drained, disappointed and honestly fed up. I’m so sorry for how long this is going to be, I literally don’t tell anyone about my marriage, but I’m at a breaking point here.\n\nToday was my (32f) birthday. I’m extremely introverted and just wanted a quiet day at home with my husband (30m) and my son (almost 1y/o m). We did go out to dinner a few days ago, which was apparently my birthday dinner, which I’ll take it because we very rarely go out to dinner! So it was a nice treat.\n\nThe day (today my actual birthday) started decent, and we went to church. But almost as soon as we got back from church my husband asked if he could go to the neighbors for a few hours to watch football. (A little back story so you don’t think I’m a completely controlling asshole that makes my husband as permission to do thing) : my husband is an alcoholic, and this neighbor, while he’s a decent guy, is where my husband ALWAYS escapes to every single weekend to go drink, almost always excessively. So when he asked to go watch the game, I was obviously upset, and told him all I wanted to do was have a family day together at the house, have a simple dinner and watch a movie.\n\nHe SWORE it would only be a couple hours and he didn’t plan on drinking too much, and he’d be home to make me dinner. I expressed again, I really didn’t want him leaving, but like every other time, he doesn’t take no for an answer, nor take my feelings into consideration and off he goes even though at this point I’m crying. \n\nFIVE hours later I’ve tried calling and texting a few times, with no answer. So me and my son go for a walk just to get out of the house, and as soon as I pull the stroller into the street, I look over at my neighbors house, and my husband and neighbor are getting in the car and leaving. I’m well versed in this scenario at this point, and know they are going to the bar. I try to enjoy our walk but once I get back home, I try calling a few more times, all being ignored. I finally call my neighbor and he tells me they are on their way back.\n\nHusband finally comes stumbling back home, not as drunk as he sometimes is, but still clearly has a buzz. I’m now feeding our son dinner, but I let my husband know how hurt I am by his actions and how I feel like I literally don’t matter to him because he literally chose football and drinking over my own birthday.  Once our son finally went to bed, my husband wanted me to go buy him cigarettes, literally hate leaving our son at home with him alone, but the alternative is we argue until he drives our one and only car drunk, so I go to avoid the potential for another DUI. I come back tell him I just want to read and relax, but wouldn’t you know he’s drank more at this point. So for the last 2.5 hours of the night, we sit on the kitchen floor while I talk him off the ledge of a depressive episode, then that turns into a heated argument somehow, where I’m at fault for so many parts of this failing marriage, then he turns angry and proceeds to literally punch our refrigerator repeatedly. No dinner was made, no relaxing day with my family, no movie. Just a complete mess of a night.\n\nI feel bad for him because he suffers massively with depression, but he REFUSES to get any help. (He did a lot of therapy as a teen and swears it doesn’t help). He’s an alcoholic, which deepens the depression into suicidal thoughts, so I have to tread lightly. But for once, I’d like to be upset or express my feelings without having to turn around and do damage control and end up having to put my hurt on the back burner. \n\nIn the grand scheme of things, this is minimal in all the shit we’ve gone through. But I feel like I’m nearing my breaking point finally with everything. Thank you for reading if you made it this far. Journaling might be the healthier, less stressful option because I know Reddit can be brutal so I’m scared lol. But that’s all, that was my absolute shit birthday. But my son was and always is the best part of my day, and if anything I’m grateful to have had a full day of a laughter and snuggles with him. \n",

      "selftext": "Got kicked out of the military at 21 (honorable) and was trying to figure out what I wanted to do. Moved between NV and GA and made some good friends and had some good times despite being an insider. Life started picking up for me at 24 or 25, when I got my first real taste of independence with my own place, a moped, and my first GF... which didn't last long but that was okay. The experience helped me find a new level of self-confidence in talking to the ladies and a lot of good friends at that job that I would occasionally hang out with. Things were going well.\n\nCue 2020, COVID pandemic, sending us all home. Just as soon as I was finding my groove in talking to women in my LIFE, we got sent home and I lost all that experience and confidence over the 1.5 years I spent cooped up inside, alone.\n\nI started going to stir-crazy I that I took a paycut to work at a store in 2022, hoping to make some new connections and that ended up being the worst, longest year of my life. It was so bad that the stress f\\*cked up my whole hairline and it still looks like dog shot to this day. The job was cool but I couldn't stand the people - they were all very cliquey and had weird anger problems.\n\nSo... I got a new job at a good commercial company which is where I'm at now, and although the pay is good, I've spent every day since March 2023 working from home. This has been the biggest hit to my self-perception ever. I've been out of the social world for so long I've developed social anxiety, depression, lost virtually all my confidence and sense of humor (which really hurts as I used to be the funniest guy ever) and I don't have close, intimate friends, and I don't even have a real social work group. My company, huge as it is, doesn't have a branch office in the major city I live in which is crazy, so working in office isn't even an option. And I'll be DAMNED if I pursue a long term career in my solitude in front of this dogged computer.\n\nI've tried doing things like going out to cafes to draw, getting a support animal (which I found out I wasn't the best person to raise one which was a very painful experience), finding online groups, and taking boxing classes, and while those were good remedies to the loneliness... just being among random people isn't the same as having a consistent group of people that you see on a daily basis and get to know on a deeper level than small talk while working towards collective goals with. I know it seems like I'm glorifying something as mundane as a people you work with, but those connections are more important for your psyche than you realize.\n\nI wouldn't mind working from home if I had a woman, a best friend, but its the isolation that has destroyed my sense of self. Without others to express myself and connect with I've lost sight of who I used to be in the years I should have been having the most fun. There was one time I broke down crying out of nowhere because of how alone and upset I was with myself. I refuse to live like this anymore. I've always had an aversion to risk but at this point I have to do something to pull myself out of this cell that is my home.\n\nI've developed some really bad addictions while working from home trying to keep myself stimulated, and I've done a good job at breaking them in the past few months, but I still find myself wanting since I don't have anything to replace them with. So... I'm going to get a landscaping job since I've always been a pretty strong and tough guy. I'm going to be putting in my two weeks at this job soon and applying to them. I'm a bit anxious about it but screw it I'll live. Its a risk that I have to take.",

      "selftext": "The situation is very complex so I will try to explain as well as I can, english is also my second language.\n\nI am a trans man who was groomed by a woman whe I was younger. Today, I am 20, but at the time I met her i was 12 (and still a girl) and she was 16. I learned not long after that she had some history with my two older brothers, she had a crush on both of them (they were around the same age) but she was rejected by both of them.\n\nShe confessed her feelings to me when I was around 14 and she was 17-18, I rejected her but she kept pressing after that in more subtiles manners: stealing my clothes, taking all my time, isolating me from my friends, using emotionnal manipulation. She would cuddle with me all the time and I would think of it as platonic friendship.\n\nI stayed friend with her and we would hang out every week, doing roleplay, cosplay and all sort of nerdy things. When we wr in cosplay, she would use it as an excuse to touch me, to take more erotic pictures and trying to get closer. I still viewed it as friendship because I was in denial.\n\nAt one point, when I was around 15-16 years old and she was 19-20, I would feel like I needed validation and send more erotic pictures to her, she would start touching me more and at some point, we kissed. It felt wrong and i was so confused, it never happened again after that but it did something to my brain.\n\nWe started having sexual relationships every week, we would stay clothed, in cosplay to use it as an excuse that we were just roleplaying. She would touch my breast, we would dry hump eachother and she would kiss my body. I never touched or kiss her because I didn't like it and it felt wrong to me (I will also precise that she hada boyfriend and that in my head it was still only friendship)\n\nWhen I was 16, in the middle of the covid, I ended up breaking up out \"friendship\" after an incident. That night it happen, I was luckily surrounded by my family, and I ended up going to sleep at my brother's appartement because of how scared I was that she would show up at my house.\n\nI feel angry, violated, dirty and disgusting. Since then, I am scared of relationships. I am scared of being touched and being outside of my house. I cannot build long term friendships that aren't online. My best friend live in France, my closest friends live in the US, India and Europe. I do not get out of my house often, I have a hard time socializing, I never go out to parties, I am scared of relationships. I think I have a crush on a friend of mine but I don't want to confess to her because I don't think I can be in a relationship.\n\nI hate that girl that fucked up my life. I hate that she fucked up my mental health, that she made me a victim. I hate her, I hate that she dosen't get any consequences because she is a woman, I hate that my parents never protected me from her even if they knew she was bad news. I hate that my mom blame me for being manipulated by that woman. I hate it.\n\nShe used me, for 4 years she used me. It wasen't love, it wasen't friendship, it was lust, manipulation. I hate her. She fucked me up and will never live the consequences. The only relief I can have is that at least at my prom, she saw how fucking awesome my dress was and I hope she was jealous as fuck. I rocked that dress, I designed it myself and my mom made it for me. She can rot in the bottom pit of hell for what I care.",

      "title": "I feel unsafe at my job and I think my manager hates me",
      "selftext": "To be clear- physically, I am pretty safe, but reputation wise, I do not feel safe or secure.\n\nI'm coming up on my third year of working with this company, and it was going well until last year, when I suffered from an injury from marathon training (on my own time) that led me to needing a surgery and taking almost two months off of work to recover. When I returned to work, I was still recovering from the injury and needed some accommodation, which I mostly provided for myself or with the help of coworkers who had dealt with similar injuries. The timing of my injury was bad. We had a big demonstration we were going to run with some long-time clients, and I found out (AFTER my injury) that my boss wanted me to talk over a hefty part of the presentation. I got hurt a week before the presentation, and was told to stay home by my doctor, and my boss was, understandably upset. I tried to offer other ways that I could support from my bed, but my boss said that it would be unacceptable for me to do the work or be present at the presentation from home- this is despite some of our key clients and one supporting manager tuning into this presentation through a video calling application.\n\nWhen I returned to work, my boss barely made eye contact with me and didn't even bother catching me up, even when I asked him for help with \"getting up to speed\". A month after my return, he called me into his office...I thought it was going to be the one-on-one catch-up meeting I needed since returning and struggling to extract the backlog of work I needed to complete, but it was not. Instead, he shared that people in the office thought I was lying about my injury and thought that my decision to continue to train for the marathon (outside of work hours) while preparing for a big presentation (during work hours) was stupid and unacceptable, and that I really did let the team down because my injury was very inconvenient and I should have been more considerate. He even went as far as suggesting that I give up on marathon running altogether since it poses such a \"risk\" to my ability to complete my job. It's just running. Secretly, I have started to run again, but I don't feel safe telling anyone about it anymore, as I think the rumors of me being a \"selfish teammate\" have finally started to die down.\n\nHe has not been very chummy with me since my injury, even when I try to be especially flattering or accommodating, so I've slowly given up on it. I just do my work now, which brings me to my next stop. Over the last year, my company found out that I run a blog. It had become pretty popular locally, and I guess someone from work brought it up to my manager, and ever since he found out, he has added blog writing and newsletter writing to my pile of work. My blog was about things I enjoyed, like local food places and fun excursions around town, and I honestly find it so hard to write with the same enthusiasm for work blogs as our industry is not very eventful. In fact, my joy for maintaining my personal blog has completely diminished in recent months, as I cannot bring myself to stare at a document with the same enthusiasm I did before I started doing this at work. I've tried compartmentalizing the tasks so I wouldn't link it back to my work routines, but I get this feeling of violation whenever I think of writing again. This summer, I was approached by a restaurant I had made a few blog posts about to do a collaboration to celebrate their milestone. I was so excited, and the blog post was great! Except, my boss later approached me at work and demanded that I attempt to get the restaurant to collaborate with our company. I already knew that what he wanted from their \"contribution\" to the collab was not something they would be willing to do, but he kept pushing me to ask anyways and made it seem like I was being selfish again by not even trying to ask. I did end up asking, and was, as expected, rejected. That was the last \"big\" blog post I did, and I have gradually stopped posting on my regular schedule because I get scared that my manager is reading about my life outside of work to see what he can take advantage of next.\n\nAbove all of these things, the one thing my boss absolutely cannot do, is manage anything. The only reason projects get done is because me and the other two people on our team are decent at what we do. We often joke that we need to \"manage up\", although, I think I'm the only one there that feels truly let down by that. My manager claims to be open to feedback, but often finds reason to discredit other people whenever they criticize him. For a while, whenever I would inquire about ongoing projects I was out of the loop on, or share feedback on materials shared with me, he would suggest that I wasn't \"in-the-know\" enough on the projects to share my thoughts on it because I had been out recovering from my little trip. Now I rarely share my actual thoughts on his or anyone's work because it takes a lot of energy to recover from his remarks, or even respond to them in the moment. \n\nWe used to have a team of five, and we are now down to four including me. When our fifth left earlier this year, he not only blamed a lot of unfinished work on them, but also started a smear campaign of sorts for them across the company. A lot of people refused to believe what he said, but a majority of the people I worked with regularly had come to see this very hard-working, excellent teammate as irresponsible and, well, selfish for leaving the company. I fear that he will do this if I leave. But he has probably already done this, since I did \"leave\" during my recovery. \n\nI have Monday and Tuesday off, a four-day weekend, but I cannot stop having occasional flickers of that ugly, ugly person that is my boss when I should be having moments of peace and relaxation. I just needed to vent about this somewhere. My friends have heard so much of my complaints, I really don't want to bring that energy into our fun weekend. Thank you.",

      "selftext": "There's really no other way to put it, I'm lonely and it's making me incredibly sad. \n\nI guess to elaborate more, I'm not lonely in the way that some people are, where they literally know nobody. I know people, but honestly this only makes it worse. I started college recently and had no friends for a while, then when I finally made some many ended up leaving. \n\nEither way I still had some people, one of whom I even considered my close friend. I had to do a summer semester when there was pretty much no one else we knew around, and we would hang out incredibly often. Well now that the regular year started we are barely acquaintances, despite him at the beginning saying that I should just message him anytime to hangout. He doesn't even respond to my messages most of the time anymore. You can't even argue he's just busy or whatever, every time I do see him he usually ends up calling or texting his other friends to come. He could easily message me at any time but chooses not to, most of his other friends he just met like a month ago also. \n\nMy other friend i see even less, despite knowing for longer. When we did speak not too long ago I actually said that I've been feeling incredibly lonely, something I've told no one else I know irl. The advice I was given was to do things by myself. \n\nHere's the thing about that, I've been doing that for the past couple years, and it sucks. This seems to be common advice to lonely people on the Internet and honestly it's terrible. Going out by yourself is not all that enjoyable, when I do it I always think I wish I was hanging out with someone and feeling lonely when I see other people with friends also outside. \n\nNot even to mention my friends from school who I obviously can only speak too online now. But we don't really say anything meaningful, if I go on a voice call with them I'm usually just tagging along, especially as I'm almost never asked to join. Something I notice is that when \"hanging\" out with others most of the time they just spend most of the time on their phone. \n\nIt's pretty clear that nobody genuinely wants to speak or be friends with me. If I died tommorow genuinely nobody where I live would even notice, let alone care. I guess for whatever reason I'm just not an interesting/likeable person, even though no one outright tells me that. They'll just stay \"friends\" with me but never contact me first first anything. As i said, If I died no one would even remember i existed. \n\nThis isn't even to mention how I don't and have never had a gf. This makes me sad as I really want cuddles and someone to love, I always cuddle my pillow due to this. I'm probably just too ugly. \n\nI feel pretty guilty for even being sad about this, there are millions of people who have much bigger problems than me, and I'm sure people would say all my problems are my own fault anyway.

      "selftext": "All names are fake.\n\nI'm (20F) the middle of three, an older brother (23M), James, and a younger brother (18M), Derek. \n\nJames has fairly severe autism, and struggles to complete daily tasks. He requires fairly constant support. That said, my dad (51M), Mike, and stepmom (47F), Allie, have regular \"date nights\", where they go out to a bar or something, and they'll find someone to take care of James on those nights. Now, I have no issues with this. I more mean it to provide context that, if they wanted to do something, they absolutely can.\n\nDerek, on the other hand, has had a lot of issues with school and the law over the years. He's gotten busted for a couple minor charges over the years (vandalism and stuff along those lines). Mike and Allie got him to take low level pleas, and paid off the fines both times. He's currently in his second year of college, and is already about to flunk out. He's had issues with school for years now, and imho, college just wasn't a good option for him. He's got a lot of skills, but I think being a tradie or an apprenticeship just would've been a better fit. No disrespect to anyone who goes down either of those paths - I just think some options work better for some people than others, and that would've suited his needs better.\n\nMost of the time, I get ignored. I get good grades, don't require substantial support, got a scholarship that covered almost all of my college (academic merit) and my biggest run-in with the law is when I got rear-ended at 17. (I was found 0% at fault, but because I was a minor, I was still taken to the station, and Mike had to pick me up from there.) I'm seen as the easy one who they don't \"need\" to support because I'm doing just fine on my own.\n\nOn the occasions I don't, I'm made to feel like the family screw-up. Despite doing well in school, having a clean record, etc., I'm not exactly the most straight-laced of people. I'm extremely alternative (most of my wardrobe is DIY'd). I skate. I have a bunch of tattoos, including some that have demonic imagery (I was smart about them, and can easily cover or hide those, if I'm in a situation where they aren't appropriate.) I enjoy joints and edibles. I regularly go to rock bars, biker bars, and other places in our area that cater to the punk scene. I spend a lot of my spare time at local protests. I've done a couple events with the Satanic Temple. Y'all get the idea. We live in a traditional, conservative, deeply religious area, and a lot of this is seen as bad. \n\nI know Mike and Allie don't approve of my choices/lifestyle. I've done well for myself, despite being seen as \"the one who went off the rails\". Derek gets the excuse of \"boys will be boys\", and James obviously isn't at fault for his issues, but it's not seen as bad if he does something odd, because of those issues. I'm the only one held to this standard.\n\nThis brings me to the reason I'm here today. I recently got confirmation that - unless I suddenly fail several classes, which is very unlikely to happen - I'm going to be graduating college in May. (I didn't skip any grade or something, like I'm not technically graduating early, it's just weird how my birthday lines up in the school year.) I was obviously ecstatic. I've worked my ass off for this, and already have a tentative offer for the spring (contingent on a couple of classes). Obviously, I was excited to tell my family, and was gushing when I brought it up over dinner.\n\nI asked Mike and Allie if they could come to my graduation. Despite the fact they've ignored most of my achievements, they've still raised me, and I just want them to celebrate me. Mike said \"well, I'm not sure, James might need us\" (I go to school near home, it would be less total time than their normal \"date nights\".) Allie asked if I was going to \"clean up\" for the ceremony. I was honest that I'd probably tone down the make-up and accessories, but a bright pink half-shaved swoop is hard to hide, so I'd keep that. She just pursed her lips, and turned back to her food. And that was it. \n\nMike came up to me later, and said that Derek had recently found he might flunk out, and I was being insensitive, and made Derek feel bad. I didn't know this at the time, and no one said anything to me during dinner. I couldn't have known. I asked him again if he'd go to my graduation, and he just said \"We'll see.\"\n\nThey only cared I would look the part and that I hurt Derek's feelings, and they used James as an excuse to postpone the decision (despite them regularly getting someone to watch him). I'm either ignored or I'm the black sheep and family embarassment. I'm tired of this and just want my family to celebrate me when I do something big. Is it too much to ask for them to be happy I'm graduating?\n\n(Before anyone asks, my mom skipped town when I was about 6, and isn't in the picture. I don't know more than that.)",

      "selftext": "I (21F) started living with two people (also both 21F) a few months ago. I’ve known one of them almost  my entire life, we’ve had a few periods where we weren’t as close but have never fought or anything like that. We get along together great, have somewhat similar interests, and living styles. The other roommate I pretty much just met. Them two have been friends for a couple years and lived together the year prior. I had met her a couple times when I was in town but never really got to talk to her.\nWhen they were moving out of their last apartment, they needed a third person and asked if I would want to move in with them which I happily agreed seeing as I was still living at home. \n\nThe first couple of weeks were fine until I started to pick up on a few things. Anything we all were in a group setting it seemed like the second roommate would be putting on an ‘act’ like playing dumb type of thing. I soon later leaned that’s just how she is which it totally fine and not what i’m upset about. What bothers me is how she doesn’t think about anyone else in the apartment. \n\nThe first roommate works a full time job and gets up at 5am pretty much everyday so she has a somewhat strict sleep schedule. I completely respect it and try to be as quiet as possible when I know she’s sleeping. The second roommate on the other hand, could not care less. It’ll be 10/11pm and she’s cooking a full blown meal in the kitchen. I’m not talking about sticking something in the microwave, i’m talking cutting board and everything. and on top of that, leaves the kitchen messy for me and the other roommate to see in the morning. I don’t cook but the other two do. A lot of nights at least one of them will have their boyfriend over cooking dinner which it totally fine! It’s just the first roommate ALWAYS cleans up after themselves pretty much immediately. The other not so much. Dishes are normally piled in the sink and there’s crumbs over all the counter tops and table. I have a sensitive nose so smells from dirty dishes sitting in the sink for days bothers the hell out of me. At first I would do them even if they weren’t mine but it’s getting to an everyday kind of thing and i’m not the maid. \n\nShe also will bring people in the apartment unannounced, also late at night. Her and her boyfriend or friends just come in out of no where. and i, considering i live here, am normally in comfy clothes that i don’t necessarily want strangers seeing. They’re also SO LOUD. like i can hear and follow along full conversations of them in the living room while im in my room with the door closed. \n\nI also share a bathroom with the second roommate. She hasn’t cleaned it once. \nThey moved in a month before me just because I still had commitments when their previous lease was up. And since i’ve moved in, she hasn’t cleaned, I have. Her boyfriend will come over and dirty up the mirror somehow getting toothpaste marks 5 feet up the mirror. The toilet gets gross and there’s normally hair or gunk in the sink. I don’t use the bathroom to get ready in as I have space in my room so im barely in there. She gets ready everyday in there which is 100% fine but never cleans up after herself. I’ve tried to hint at it being like “oh the bathroom needs cleaning” and she goes “yeah it really does” and continues about her day. \n\nWhat’s funny about all this is her room is pretty much spotless. Out of the three of us i’m the less of a “neat freak”. I have decoration clutter around my room and don’t make my bed everyday but I don’t care cause it’s MY space, they don’t have to live in it. Plus I pretty much keep my door shut whether i’m in there or not. Her on the other hand keeps her personal space super neat and clean and gets everywhere else gross. \n\nI don’t know if i’m just being super nit picky but I don’t want things to get worse.",

      "title": "My ex is hating on me on social media.",
      "selftext": "I always thought we had the \"upper hand\" on a lot of other relationships as it was always very important for us to never purposefully hurt the other. We were friends first and foremost and we cared about each other way more than just romantically. That was the plan, anyways.\n\nI ended it, but we agreed we are on good terms. We just seemed to bring out the worst in each other and agreed to want to cherish what we had before it goes to shit.\n\nBut now here we are. One year after the breakup. He reached out a couple times, which did not go well. No hate, just, two hurt people trying to be friends too quick. So the bitterness came after all. For both me and him. But we were still on good terms, or so i thought.\n\nYes, checking my exes socials is on me. I am aware. But during a time of contact I saw his Threads account and realized how much of it is just.. fucking mean. He is an incredibly hateful person on there and I didnt know him like that. Kinda the reason I ended contact that time. We didnt get along as people anymore anyways but this was the final straw. So once every few weeks i still went to check it out, because i care about him still, not in a romantic way at all but just as a person. I wanted him to be happy and I hoped maybe I could see a sign of it there so I could stop worrying.\n\nAnd then there started being posts about me? Not my name but it was pretty fucking clear. It was little jabs like \"My last ex was a rebound, it doesnt count.\" And he knew that was a major insecurity I had by merit of how our relationship started. Best part is, he still posted about his prior ex too.  \nSo there I see it, a grown man, hating on his 2 previous girlfriends on public socials. Hating on other women along the way, if hes not currently mocking people speaking about mental health or such.\n\nIt feels like I am watching him fall into a hole he keeps digging himself. a very dark, very angry hole.  \nHe used to be so kind and caring, which is why I wanted to protect him from me so much. Im not hateful or agressive but I know that me for example crying a lot can be very tiring too, especially for someone as caring as him.\n\nSo I asked him about a few of the posts. He said it was jokes. I said it was not very kind, he simply replied \"Dont stalk my socials if you are this sensitive.\" I dont want to give more details on the posts, but I asked 2 different friends (both guys) and they both agreed that some of the shit he posted was fucked up.  \nHis reaction startled me a lot. he literally never in his life spoke to me like that. So I told him what I was thinking: that I just hoped he was doing good and that he better get his shit together because he looks like a fool. Last part was a lil mean maybe, but I was so shocked at his coldness I honestly didnt care to filter myself too much there. And he really does seem like a terrible person on there. Well, I guess in real life as well now.\n\nBut of course that wasnt the end of it. Today I checked again, its been 2 weeks. 5 different posts targeting me, even more hateful now. for reference, 8 posts overall in that time.\n\nI really dont know what I did to deserve this. I know I am not flawless but I know how much worth I put on being the best person I can be towards others. I never take revenge, I never target weakpoints, I always had his best interest at heart. I really, really did. I wanted to be with him so bad, I just saw how much it drained him. It fucking hurts SO bad to know that the person I only want the best for hates my guts and I dont even know why. If I knew what I did I could at least work on it, but I dont. I guess I still wish the best for him? Even though Im not sure he still wants me to.  \nHe got me out of a very deep hole when we met and I will always be thankful. But Im very sad he will never be proud of me again. I changed in a lot of good ways since we broke up, a lot of it with him in mind. I told myself that if I ever want to deserve someone like him again I'll have to put the work in, and I did, and I hoped he would be proud of me one day. I really thought our bond was more than romance, it was truly the most special relationship I had and he said the same.\n\nBut he will never be proud of me. And Ill have to learn to be okay with that. We will never sit on that porch, our new partners next to us, My kids on a playdate with his kids like we always said after the breakup. I know he will never read this, as he only uses reddit for corn. Still, since we have each other blocked absolutely everywhere, I'll say goodbye here for the final time.  \nGood luck, A. I loved you, I thank you for your time, Im sorry things had to be this way and I hope you find out of that hole by yourself too. I wish I could be there for you but neither do you want me to nor would I be any help.  \nThank you for reading",

I thought that me being a guy and her being a girl was enough to offset the fact that she’s very athletic and sportive but I dunno I guess not.\n\nAfterwards she laughed and said something along the lines of “How are you gonna protect me if you’re weaker than me?” which made me feel pretty shitty, she’d probably say she’s only “joking” if you were to ask her though.\n\nIdk what to feel.

      "title": "OCD is ruining me",
      "selftext": "**TRIGGER WARNING: Mentions of self-harm, suicidal ideation, obsessing over thinking someone was sexually abusing a child (OCD related), general bad mental health stuff, etc.**\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter a heavenly 2-ish years my OCD has started creeping back into my [17M] life to the point it’s ruining me, my relationships with other people, and my living space.\n\nMy current main subtypes are contamination, moral scrupulosity, real event, and POCD.\n\nMy dad knows about my diagnosis and is also diagnosed. I would expect that to lead him to understand, but it really doesn’t. When I finally broke down and told him about the thoughts I was having (pre-diagnosis) he told me that I was dealing with POCD and that a family member of ours had it. I felt understood then, but it’s like after that he just expected me to be completely okay and have my OCD spawn out of my life.\n\nWith my hand washing obsession, I tend to ask when it’s reasonable to wash my hands (which I know is reassurance seeking)  and he’ll get upset and go silent or tell me I’m being ridiculous and that I’m almost an adult and shouldn’t need to ask when it’s okay to wash my hands.\n\nAnd for something that happened a few months ago, we had gone to see a band (that he’s been wanting to see for ages) and I saw a guy comforting his baby and I got all these memories flooding back of random Reddit posts where the dad was abusing the baby that way and I started panicking and thinking I was a horrible person for not saying anything and that I was just as bad, despite knowing that’s just how you calm down a baby. I knew I was being irrational, but I just couldn’t calm down.\n\nSo, when we got to concert hall I told my dad about it (without mentioning all the details. Just said “I saw someone calming down their baby and my brain is trying to convince me that he was doing bad things and I know I’m being irrational”) and I just regretted it as soon as I said it. It wasn’t something I should have said, let alone there. He got upset with me and said that he was going yo be upset if I ruined the concert for him and that I was being ridiculous and that what I saw was just a guy calming down his baby. When I said I knew I was being irrational, he got annoyed and then it kinda spiraled into an argument. I said, again, that I knew I was being irrational that that I wish he would just be a little more understanding (or something along those lines) and he just started talking about how it would be like if I was scared a dinosaur was going to eat the lead singer.\n\nThen, after more arguing, it got to the point where he was bringing up how “only one of us got to go to therapy” (me) and that what I went through when I was younger affecting him and that I didn’t understand how much. What he was referencing was when I was extremely suicidal, was self-harming a lot (and badly to the point I would need stitches), doing risky things online, talking to bad people, and getting myself hospitalized twice.\n\nAnd it’s just, it’s not the first time he’s said this. Several times he’s said that what I went through was more traumatizing for him than it was for me and that I traumatized him. Which, I understand that. Not to the point a parent would, of course. But at the same time he doesn’t even know half of the things I went through (and still go through) and I honestly don’t think I can ever tell him. It just hurts to hear him talk like that and makes me never want to open up to him again.\n\nBack to the argument. So after that I got really quiet. Scrolled social media for a bit, and then started feeling really guilty and didn’t was to ruin the show. So I apologized and dropped it and we had a great time seeing the bad. But it just won’y leave my mind.\n\nMy OCD just keeps on getting worse and worse and it’s ruining my life. But obviously I must be fine since I’m not longer cutting or doing drugs. My grades are okay and I seem fine to the people around me. I don’t know. It’s just really hard to get through the day lately. Everything seems to trigger my OCD and I just feel like I have no support. Like, don’t get me wrong. My dad is great in all other aspects, he’s the one who supported me through the hardest time of my life and did everything he could and was recommended to to, it’s just that I don’t think he understands this and it hurts a lot.",

Ive moved in with my boyfriend who is amazing and helps me in any way I need. I had a stroke in June and am 26 years old. my brain doesn’t work the same anymore and everything is so overwhelming. I want a life for myself and I am being made to feel like because I’ve distanced myself for my own health that I am punishing them. how they’ve done so much for me and it just adds to the guilt, I just want to not feel guilty for having a quiet night and not feel the need to answer their texts/calls. I’ve told her how I feel and the response is just so you must not love me? what did I do to you for you to treat me this way? I feel like I’m in a prison yet I’ve moved away, how do I start to feel like I’m living my own life again?",

      "selftext": "I'm the middle child, and a stereotypical one at that. Frequently felt overlooked while growing up, am very quiet, introverted, independent. My younger sister is the golden child and my older brother is the trouble child. My parents always told me how much they appreciated that I was \"easy\" so that's what I strived for.\n\nSo I didn't think anyone would care when I moved to the other side of the country in 2015. I'd met someone online and they invited me to come visit after a long time of talking. It went really well and I decided to move to the area. Like 50/50 I moved to be with them, and 50/50 I moved for the nicer weather. I grew up in the midwest US and winters are long and miserable. They lived in the south and it was so warm and lovely and peaceful and quiet (rural area).\n\nIt worked out though. We're still together and happy, 11 yrs later. For me, it was the best decision I've ever made. I want to spend the rest of my life with this person.\n\nBut, surprisingly, my folks were gutted. They came to visit me about 8 months after I moved, and 6 months after that, they moved to the same area. It all happened so fast.\n\nMy golden child sister was devastated - she's always been very close with our mom, and on top of that she'd been counting on my mom for childcare. My aunt basically treated my mom like she'd committed treason or something, and quit talking to her. My brother didn't get the appeal but thankfully wasn't a total ass about it, but wasn't exactly kind either. Still, I felt so guilty that my sister and aunt were so upset. I didn't ask my parents to move here.\n\nUltimately, my sister followed my parents the year after that. Her husband did NOT want to be here, and it became a major point of contention in their marriage, one of many that led to their divorce.\n\nMy folks seemed pretty happy here for the first 3 years or so, but quickly became bored. This is a very rural area, not much to do. Where we came from is pretty urban so it was a huge change. They started complaining. They hate the heat, they hate the locals, they hate the food. Everything sucks. Everything is better where we came from.\n\nMy brother offered them help to move back, offered to pay for an apartment for them. I offered to help them back up their house. We all offered to pay for a rental truck. They declined every offer and said they didn't want to move again and this is where they will die.\n\nAnd so it went.  \n\nMy dad died this week. He was 79. Stopped taking his blood pressure meds, unbeknownst to anyone, and had a stroke. He collapsed and was gone before the paramedics arrived. It was still traumatic. Especially for my brother who could not be here.\n\nMy aunt refused to answer the phone when my mom called to tell her. They had been tentatively working on rebuilding their relationship. But idk I guess because we are traitors or whatever for moving away from our hometown, she thinks this was deserved. So for my mom it feels like she lost her sister and husband in one fell swoop.\n\nMy mom keeps saying she wishes she never came down here.  Like my dad wasn't 79 and was going to live forever so long as he stayed in our hometown. I know it's just grief. But it feels bad.\n\nShe told my brother that my dad would sometimes get stuck in these nostalgia loops. He'd spend a long evening looking at old photos or home movies and then burst out in tears. Partly because he missed home. And partly because home is kind of gone now. A lot of their friends are also passed away now, and the city we lived in has grown and changed a LOT - it's unrecognizable. Even if they went back physically, it won't ever be the same. The people and places they knew are gone.\n\nBut they blame the city we live in now for everything. And it feels like by extension they are blaming me. Like if only I'd sucked it up and stayed there, we'd all still be happy (I wouldn't have been).\n\nI know it's not my fault. I know I didn't ask them to follow me. But it still feels like my fault. Feels like they are blaming me.\n\nI think my sister and her new husband are wanting to leave the state. I think it will be very easy now for them to convince mom to join them. And then I will be alone again.\n\n42 years old and still feeling like the unwanted, overlooked, scapegoat middle child.",

      "selftext": "I have no one to talk to about this outside of my husband, and feel like I'm going to combust. \n\nBackground: I have a deadly allergy to something that's in most manufacturered foods or on most packages. I have been in the hospital for anaphylaxis repeatedly over the last few years and it was so bad, that I'm on shots and a ton of medications to help. \n\nWhile these things were happening, I had received a few hypothetical, \"We think it could be x, y or z, but have to do more tests.\" And the only way the tests could really happen, is if I had more anaphylactic episodes so they could have a baseline. Well, they got their wish. Nearly 200 visits in five years just for anaphylaxis. \n\nMy last one was recently, and I had to stay in the hospital for a few days. The specialists have said that we have ruled out every possible alternative, and we are down to one. It is the one I have been dreading. It is the one that causes mental health crisis and random anaphylactic reactions with no trigger. It's one that can't be cured or really dealt with. They've said I have to have a biopsy, and see hematology at the cancer center to have some tests done to test for some various blood cancers as well. I've been WFH with a swollen face from hives, I'm tired because I'm not sleeping, and I feel like everything has just cracked. I've had to withdraw from classes because I had multiple rebound episodes within the last few weeks and I can't concentrate.\n\nAll of my meds have been increased, but those are now causing other issues. I'm sick all the time at the moment. I'm exhausted. I'm struggling to do basic things. Even breathing hurts. I'm emotional. I have talked to my family about it and they were relieved it's not an autoimmune disease, as if a blood disease and being tested for blood cancer makes it better? They said, \"Well, other people have it worse.\" But, I'm your child?? I'm struggling right now and communicating to you that I'm struggling. I'm communicating to you that I'm scared. Instead of being supportive, you tell me other people have it worse? \n\nMy husband has been great, thankfully, and will be taking me to the consult and taking me for the procedure. He's also been compiling questions and doing research to ask them. He's told me to block my parents for the time being because he doesn't want their comments to hurt me. They already have hurt me. My psych is amazing and has helped me break down what I need to do, but I feel as though I'm powerless at the moment. I have very few support systems outside of my husband, as you can tell by my family's response, and feel so isolated. I'm terrified. I'm not feeling better and that's also terrifying. \n\nI just needed to get this out there because I feel like my skin is prickly and tears are hot in my eyes but inside I feel... Cold. ",

For the first time in YEARS i had friends and now I’ve got absolutely nothing to show except a degree that does nothing for me. I have no clue how to dig myself out of this rut because i can’t get money to move somewhere until i have a job, but i can’t get a job without moving somewhere. I never got an internship, i’ve only worked barely relevant jobs and none of my applications even get a response. I’m at a loss for what to do in life at this point and i can’t see in my family’s eyes that they’ve got no hope for me either. I never thought it possible to start life out as a failure but here i am.\n\nedit: I don’t even really have skills.

      "title": "How I (29F) lost my life while still alive.",
      "selftext": "Here’s the story of how my life was destroyed, disclaimer it’s a long read.\n\nI (29F) had my life destroyed. I’m not entirely sure if I can say it was a result of my own actions (I have no problem taking accountability), or others. I also cannot say for certain if this was overnight (sure felt like it), or a gradual process I neglected to see until the last moment.\n\nThere was a time where I had it all. Did the right thing and went to college, double majored in psychology and computer science. I graduated during COVID, and despite the climate of the pandemic, I was able to secure a fulltime role as a fullstack software engineer. I was ecstatic and over the moon. Following that, I got engaged and married to my boyfriend of years. It all started to flow together, the job, the husband, the beautiful house, the dream car. I travelled, had great friends, and lived a comfortable life, and I had accomplished this all by 25. To me, I was in paradise of the American dream, as I had grown up in severe poverty and abuse. I felt true liberation.\n\nHowever, december 2022 would mark the beginning of the end. That month I was part of a layoff, which is not unique to me. Many in the tech industry face this. However, being a fresh college graduate, with little experience, and working at a small startup deemed me useless to prospective employers. The market itself was about to get undeniably horrific, which added to the climate. I did what any other would do, I began applying, cleaning up my LinkedIn, networking. I customized my resumes based on job descriptions, wrote cover letters. I even started an excel sheet to track all this. Rejection after rejection, and the number began to climb, and the months started to pass by. At the same time, significant issues were occurring between my husband and I. Constantly fighting, I won’t go into the depth of that as it would require a novel. I also began developing health issues, where I was hospitalized. I went through it alone, as my “husband” was no where to be seen. Yet despite this I continued on. The beginning of 2024 marked 1 year unemployed. It also marked the beginning of my divorce. A man I thought I knew for 6 years. It also marked countless hospitalizations. Countless rejections.\n\nYet I persisted, and continued to survive. Not for myself, but for my mother who had done everything and anything possible to provide for my siblings and I to achieve the American dream. I moved back home February of 2024 as I was relying on savings and could not rent. February is my birthday month, and I now despise it as it reminds me of what happened. Many friends turned on me and showed their true colors when I fell and was left with nothing. I had to move everything alone from our house from one state to another because my ex refused to do so.\n\nI was applying now both in my field and outside it. Even though I did not want too, I told myself maybe this was an opportunity at a new chapter. I started at the gym, I continued applying. The market continued to get exponentially worse. I was dealing with divorce proceeedings. I decided in August of 2024 I would go back to school for a diploma in marketing as I did not have the energy or funds quite frankly for a masters. What was promising about this program is the internship component it had. I told myself I could make a career change and maybe software was not meant for me. I began in September of 2024. I continued applying, I was in school, I was losing weight and gaining muscle and getting my health back. Life looked promising.\n\nFast forward to February of 2025. It’s always that month aha. My ex and I had our divorce finalized October of 2024. I find out that he got remarried February first to a girl that was at our wedding, 4 months after we got divorced. I can’t begin to describe the pain of that moment. It feels as though not enough words in the English dictionary could portray the depth of the wound. Alongside constant rejections, and over 2 years of unemployment, I began to crumble inside. Any glimmer of hope I had was gone. I was not able to secure even an internship to finish the program for the summer, possibly due to my gap, or the market but my program did nothing to help their students secure anything. I don’t know. I had used my savings to pay for this program out of pocket as my last life line.\n\nSo where are we now? It’s October 2025. Come December I will complete 3 years of unemployment. 5,673. That’s the number of applications I have done. Please don’t ask me if I have done X thing, because I applied to factory work, retail etc. for minimum wage, and was still denied. I have run out of money, I live at home, I have no work, no hope, friends no longer want to see me due to my nihilism and pessimism. I lost all my assets as I had to liquidate them for the money. I don’t qualify for any sort of government funding. There is no one and nothing left. I don’t have it within me to continue going on. Now I find myself watching my life go by from the sidelines. A shell, completely vacant. Once full of life, hope, dreams, ambition. Once with multiple degrees, multiple passports, tons of hobbies, once with joy, once with passion and fire. Now I am nothing. I barely have the energy to eat. I think I will try to end it soon. I literally cannot envision a future. I don’t believe there is any way out anymore.\n\nAs a child I would wonder what I would become. The possibilities were endless. I can do so much, yet I am nothing. Who knew in the end I would end up as a failure. This, ladies and gentlemen, is the American dream served to you on a silver platter.",

      "selftext": "Like everyone, I've been through so much suffering and confusion and I've been in a position, since 6 years old, where I've wanted to end it all. I'm 18 now and the only reason I'm not dead is because I'm trying to stay alive for the sake of my 2 cats and my dad. But I am slipping darker and darker every day. Mental health services are no good. Drugs are no good. I don't have any friends and can't maintain any friendships I manage to form. \n\nMy dad raised me in a religion which I don't believe in but I don't want to say I don't believe in either. Because I just don't know anymore what reality is. Even it even exists or if we're all in a pocket dimension of nonsense and none of this is actually happening. Like we're a dream being dreamt by nothing. And when the dream ends, nothing will wake up. Forever for eternity, there will be nothing. \n\nI can't die until my cats and dad are dead. Dad is not well, he might die in the next decade. Cats are still young. So I have years of this left. I can't bear the thought. I can't live any longer. I don't want to have faith in what I'm supposed to. I'm tired. I want to become a Buddha. This is a last ditch effort. Someone put me on the right path. How do I become a Buddha? Where do I start? How do I keep going when I start? So on",

      "title": "I told my ex‘s fiancée the truth and now I am falling apart",
      "selftext": "I (35F) just need to get this out somewhere…\n\nAbout 8 years ago I broke up with my ex (37M) that I loved very much out of fear. For a bit of context: I suffer from BPD and hadn’t hat proper therapy at that time. I really regretted breaking up with him and wanted him back, but he said I destroyed him. Over the years he kept coming back into my life, mostly for sex while he was in other relationships. He always had perfect timing with his appearances- always when I was weak or freshly broken up. I kept letting it happen, hoping that maybe if I was just good enough or perfect enough he’d love me again.\n\nLast month, after it happened again, I finally found the courage and told his fiancée the truth about our affair. I did it because I couldn’t live with the lies anymore. He always said I’d never tell her, because I knew it would destroy and sever everything between us. Yet I did it and it freaked me out.\n\nThe moment I dm‘d her, I blocked him everywhere. I try to avoid him, but every now and then I see him in person and he doesn’t look at me anymore. I act cool and polite but inside I am just crumbling. It hurts so much to be invisible. I knew that it will hurt. I knew my intrusive thoughts and craving him will happen…but I didn’t think it would be so hard.\n\nSince then I’ve found out from someone that they haven’t broken up and that they are trying to fix their relationship. It was a punch in the face…It feels like he never faces any consequences. I known shouldn’t care, but I hoped for once I win against him. I know it sounds so stupid and I know I am not a good person either, engaging with him while I know he’s in a relationship, but still, I am somehow gutted.\n\nI’ve noticed that I am also drinking a little more recklessly and that honestly scares me. One night I was really drunk and got so angry and so fucking disappointed in my life choices that I ended up self harming myself for the first time in years. I feel so ashamed of myself.\n\nI hate to admit it, but some of that recklessness was because I wanted him to notice. He once told me he will always care, that he will always look out for me and make sure I was okay (he knows about my upbringing and my abusive childhood). This feeling of loss feels unbearable somehow even though I know he probably was never really protecting me, but taking advantage of my need of him, the need of being wanted by him and validated by him.\n\nI feel numb ever since, I’m just functioning. I know this wasn’t love, but the bond still weighs so heavy on me. I miss the way he said my name, the way he made me feel seen, his smell, his touch…even though I know it was control. I hate myself for still craving it and craving him.\n\nI just want to stop hurting over someone who never really wanted me. But the truth is, I don’t even know how to feel like myself anymore. I keep trying to move forward, but everything feels heavy. I’m so tired of just surviving. I know that therapy would help and my friends try to support me, but I don’t feel ready to see a therapist again - not only because of financial constraints but also because I don’t want to open up old wounds from the past that I have healed to my best abilities- if that makes sense.\n\nThanks for reading.",

      "selftext": "Ever since I entered young adulthood, I’ve felt a little overwhelmed with feelings of being selfish and repulse towards myself because of being a person who doesn’t care about others, who always criticizes others or finds something bad about other people. Hence my inability to form solid relationships among others. But lately, I don’t feel that battle anymore, I feel as though cynicism has won, I do not respect my family anymore, I often feel better than everyone else and honestly, I feel like I don’t have values anymore. I’m living a double life, I am academically and professionally successful (I study college and at the same time work in my field) I’ve prostituted myself, I’ve dated men in committed relationships just to feel something, and I act nice with authority figures I hate just to get something out of them.\n\nMy rage towards my family is growing, even though I have a salary, I can’t afford living on my own yet, since I have to pay for college and it is very expensive, especially if you consider that I have a very miserable upbringing. I will live with them up until I finish my degree, that is common in my country btw. But I can’t stand them anymore, I don’t talk to my father even though we share the same space. He has never held a job for more than three months and he’s an alcoholic that prefers to spend his money on beer instead of feeding his family (I have a 10 yo brother). I just feel like he’s too stupid to give me any advice at all, so I blatantly ignore him. The same with my siblings, I sometimes don’t like how they talk, how they act and I find myself always criticizing them. We are a broke family, and although this situation is not 100% their fault, I resent them for making bad decisions after bad decisions. They’ve been scammed, my father made my mother pregnant when they were drowning in debt, they either work in the informal sector or don´t work at all, every time it gets ugly, we have to change the city we live in, etc. On top of that, my mom invited my single-mother aunt to our rented house, with her two children without asking the landlord. The landlord got mad and we’re threatened to look for another house (a city in which houses are very expensive) my aunt is not the most hygienic person and ever since she moved with us the house smells badly.\n\nLately, I’ve been having “success” in my career, I have the best GPA of my class, I’m gaining contacts, I’ve participated in national events regarding my career, my college and workplace have paid for trips in order to represent them, I’m gaining popularity in mi field, I’ve also made contributions to 3 academic congresses in my country. (the men I have sex with are not involved in my academic or professional success, I just need them for money).\n\nMy mom says I have adopted a very selfish mindset, that I do not know the meaning of humility, that I am harsh when I talk to her, that I offend her every time I open my mouth. Honestly, I feel like this abuser in the relationship who is always shaming her for the situation we live in, I’m not happy with her parenting (I can’t help but remind her that she shouldn’t be all the time with my little brother, he also needs time with his friends). I’m always judging my parents for their inability to gives us a normal life. We (4 people) sleep in the same bedroom for fucks’ sake!! They can’t afford medical healthcare; they didn’t save for their retirement (how? Without a proper job?), they have borrowed money from the bank because other people scammed them… I really, really resent them. I live in constant stress because I know that I will have to take care of them, since they don’t have anyone else and they’re in they’re almost in their 60s now, my dad didn’t even finish elementary school. I snap at the minimal provocation because I’m always thinking on how this misery prevents me from giving my full potential. As a kid and teen, I never had friends because I was embarrassed to tell them that my parents were unemployed or that we can’t play at home because it is ugly af. People in my environment are very classist and I didn’t want to be discriminated. I still lie about my background, but sooner or later people will notice the inconsistences.\n\nAll of this has led to a wide the gap between my family, other people and I, my mother’s say I’m a very arrogant person, my father never says anything, he doesn’t even look me in the eye, my brother never talks to me either and I feel this bitterness growing and growing inside me. I already go to therapy but in the sessions, we only work with my social anxiety since I don’t want to have it and miss professional or academic opportunities because of that. I feel like evil has won, that I am extremely ungrateful and I’ve lost my opportunity to be a normal person.",

I picked out the majors that I thought were expanding on my skills and passions and got confirmation that I was accepted fairly quickly. I was excited. \n\nLast week we had this introduction to all the new students where we were told what we could expect from our studies. The event was about six hours long and when I got home I cried through the whole night because I was so overwhelmed. \n\nNot only did the people presenting not know the answers to a lot of our questions, but a couple of other students i talked to afterwards were already looking for job offers instead of wanting to continue. I feel the same.\n\nI have no idea how the schedule works, no idea what books I need, and I probably already messed up on signing up for necessary classes. Having no guidance whatsoever just isn't something I can handle I suppose. \n\nMy best friend of over two years also started University with me and hasn't spoken to me since finding connections in their major.\n\nI honestly just feel stupid for not being able to go through with this. I wish I could but I know that I can't do this for the next three years. My plan is to finish this semester as I've already paid for it, then leave before the finals. \n\nI hope my family won't be too disappointed as I would have been the first to attend University but oh well. Doesn't always work out the way you want.\n\n",

But it’s much more bittersweet than this! I do and always did have people in my life to loved, understood and supported me! They just didn’t always have the time or bandwidth to understand me, I thought that was betrayal to the term bffs for life or whatever! But now I have genuinely learnt to let go of expectations and therefore disappointments, I use to resent my friends for awhile for “abandoning me” but it’s just they had their own lives! Just coz I didn’t have anything going on for me and my entire identity was built around being there for my friends and expecting vice versa I was sad that they didn’t live up to my standards! Now I have freed both them and myself of this! It’s a huge relief, they sometimes say they miss the old me who was always there for them but they kinda burnt her out so…..👀! Point is to have mutual expectations so no one feels used or neglected! I now focus my energy on my career, which I had long neglected! My family, especially my mother who has been there for me more than anyone else in my life, although sometimes she doesn’t get me due to the generational gap but atleast she tries and I love her! Also my sisters(they are cousins but the bond is very real) So I am no longer sad or lonely or dissatisfied with my life although one downside to adulting is that I am not as naïve and hopeful as I used to be when I was younger! I now make peace with reality, being whatever it is and try to find some reason or joy into what I already have going for me! Nice colleagues, time for my hobbies etc etc.",

      "selftext": "\nIt's a gray October, Sunday, somewhere in Europe. I just ate yesterday's leftovers alone in a half furnished apartment I rented for a life that never moved in. \n\nI'm not writing this to be heard. I just need to place these empress these thoughts somewhere outside this deafening silence.\n\nI need to be clear. I'm not fabricating or twisting anything here. I write things as I lived and felt them, emotionally, yes, but never dishonestly. I know my views are objective, but I try to be as close to the truth, to the objective truth, as it should be. \n\nAnd I'm not here to paint her as a villain. She is far from a monster or even if a monster, it might be a quite one, like from Monster Inc. the movie we both enjoyed some time. She has her own traumas, her own impulses, confusions, and perhaps even a kind of naivity. She carries things I may never fully understand, and maybe she never found the words to express them. This is simply my account, my sound of a story that broke both of us in different ways. \n\nWhen it all began, I loved her with blind devotion. I worshiped her, honestly. I ignored every warning sign. Then slowly, small things began to unsettle me, quiet inconsistencies, past stories started to slightly shape, provocative jokes about liberty and desires that I dismissed at the time. I told myself, “love means trust, and trust requires no proof”. Otherwise it would not be trust, it would be knowledge, mere statistics or sth. Where is this magical think we call “falling in love”, if you seek for guarantees, right? “F conformity”, I said, and kept up…\n\nBut once doubt takes root, it grows at night. I fell into obsession, I devoted to introversion, drugs and long nights without sleep, just scrolling on my phone and thinking how I can figure this riddle out…\n\nI started searching for answers in any way possible, in places where no light exists, with my only limit being her reputation and dignity. \n\nEventually, I confessed it to her and, I begged for her assistance. Believing it was my illness, not her actions, I wanted it to be fixed, with her, for her and for us. \n\nIn parallel, I took the initiative. I found an opportunity, a nice bargain, so suggested and she agreed to build the life together. I managed to secure us this home. I signed it, paid it, started furnishing it alone. I even told her to keep her old apartment for security. No pressure, no deadlines. She agreed…\n\nAnd then she vanished. She withdrew, delayed everything with impossible ideas, lied about money and savings, contributed almost nothing, and then, in the middle of my busiest period at work, with my obsession, tearing me apart, guess what? She left me. \n\nI was already collapsing. But that's on me. What destroyed me wasn't just the living, but what came next. Within two weeks during our separation, things being still upon settlement, she was with another man, a one night story, to put it politely, with someone who flushed fake wealth or whatever kind of importance to her. I na aged to find the guy, she doesn’t know, but I even met him somehow… everything on a “no” or “fake” if I may say name-basis. Not proud of that, to be honest. \n\nYou see, she later said she did it because he was funny, I guess, in her own language or something like that. He is not funny. In no language. And he is a scam, and I felt sorry for me and for her. And that justification sentence of her cut me deeper than the act itself, but yet, because I am fool and I am blind and for that I still do not feel any shame, I kept believing, and we decided to try again. \n\nShe came back to the house. I had kept everything alive. For a short while, there was some calmness. Things were going relatively smooth. And then her jealously returned. Accusations against me, as if I had done what she had done in ten times worse manner. \n\nAnd I admit it: this time I lost control, I became harsh, angry beyond recognition. I despised the version of myself that surfaced. I harassed her in words, no physical reaction of course, not by me to her, just to say it blandly. \n\nShe cursed me on her own way. A very rough way, I might say. She wished me death and the death of my children and same fate for the children of my children. No matter, even if never meant to be born, what can I say? Who wishes death even to a far distant chance of life? \n\nAnd she called me “the vomit” of my father. A father who keeps abusing me even till now, in his own twisted way… and she knows that, I told her everything. In fact, she is the only one that has met him since, I don’t know, my teenager years. \n\nThat phrase is so cruel that it becomes poetic. I’m to a certain extent someone engaged with reading and writing. I have studied law and philosophy. I’ve written poetry at my youth. I truly believe that this is something already cultivated… it did not come out of the blue. But what can I say again… I guess it’s a talent you cannot hide, right?\n\nAfter that, I truly fell. Drugsjave taken over, insomnia (I am, as we speak, pretty much three days with less then three broken hours asleep), I feel pain on my chest and dizzy, and I truly underperform at work. I am falling without making any noise into this bottomless well I dug myself so willingly. And there, in that darkness, I found some evidence (no proof, I need to be clear) about those dark deeds I was suspicious of… my breath stops here. Because, these things are not to be heard or written. Only under demand and in very specific circumstances. These are things to be kept secret until you die. But your significant other, the one who trusts you with their life, deserves to know, to decided in that basis. I have never been shown that decency… hell, even if nothing is true, the existence of those supposed clues, feeding this up by just not ensuring anyone against those things… the mere thought of it as it had been poisoning my mind… I charge her with that. God save me, no matter how young, or inexperienced or naive you are, you cannot escape those charges… families and lives are being destroyed and one cannot be just like “don’t worry, there is no issue”… There is an issue even if there is none, if you feel me.\n\nI will stop it here.\n\nMy life detached from everything. Work, friends, family, all poisoned by the same egg. I accept responsibility, but any kind of peace would have helped me. And still, despite everything, I love her, I cannot deny it. It is a sickness, a spell, a wicked sorcery… But I miss her; I miss her smile, her voice in the mornings, even her terrible jokes. That's not her music taste. Love has limits, right? \n\nThe absence of her is sometimes louder than her presence ever was. I know she will move on quickly. She always lands on her feet, maybe next to a new car or a new promise. \n\nI remain here, among packages,!empty rooms and lessons written in pain, but I survived. I'm not healed, not redeemed, but still breathing. That counts for now. \n\nThis is not a plea or a demand for pity or revenge. I don't want anyone to choose sides. I simply need to place this world somewhere outside my troubled head. I'm trying slowly to rise, I know I will, even if from ashes I helped to create, like a mythical phoenix. \n\nLet's hope for the best.\n\n🐦‍🔥\n",

      "selftext": "Here’s the three most painful experiences I go through every single day.\n\n\nNo love life: I am still a virgin as a 20 year old man. I had no girlfriend. I hate Valentine’s Day just because it’s a reminder that not one girl wanted me. And it’s even worse when I go on social media and I see a couple enjoying life and happy together. And every single time I tell someone about it, it’s always “being in a relationship doesn’t matter; focus on yourself”. And it makes me visibly ill when I hear people say that because it’s so EASY to say or think that when you either in a relationship or already have been in one.\n\nFeeling like I’m behind on everything: I see most people my age already have a house, a car and traveling. And here I am, financially struggling to try to help my mom out. And then all I hear people say is “you’re still young, you got all the time in the world”. And yet people even younger than me are way more successful than I am. I’m trying to catch up and get my family out of the financial mess we’re STILL in.\n\nParanoia: I’m always super vigilant about my surroundings. To the point where anyone I come across, even if I’ve seen them before, is an automatic threat. And everyone always says “you’re overthinking it, nobody is out to get you”. And I hate that mindset due to the amount of shit I hear and see daily. Don’t give that toxic positivity, I’ve been through too much to not be aware of who I “trust”.\n\nI hate when my experiences get dismissed as “worrying about the small things” like this shit ain’t serious.",

      "selftext": "According to my friends I've had the \"glowup of the century\". When I was younger, I was all about school and following the rules (think Hermione Granger lol), and I've also always had very geeky interests. Also, after being bullied at age 11, I became pretty withdrawn. My school is K-12 so I got used to people perceiving me as a nerd and as smart.\n\nDuring college, I began to see myself as confident, beautiful, and fun (and smart!), something I never thought would ever happen. I became a bubbly, outgoing person, and I didn't even realize until other people told me. Plus, I started to take care of my appearance. Yeah, people can never guess my major or interests based on how I look and act, but it's a fun conversation starter! The only thing that bugs me is when someone starts talking to me and says something like: “Wow, you’re actually so smart!”. I know they mean well so it's okay, even if once in a while it feels off lol.\n\nStill, that weird feeling is exponentially worse at the club. If I'm with a group, I'm usually the one hit on by older guys (crazy considering I'm 21 and I'm told I look 18), or approached to \"make out\" out of nowhere. One time a guy just wouldn't let me go until my guy friends intervened because my words meant nothing to him.\n\nYesterday was so bad. After talking like two minutes with someone a friend knew, I was “offered” to do sexual favors in exchange for VIP access and a table. (I'd never judge another girl for doing that, but I don't want to be perceived this way.) My friend apologized profusely, they met on this same club and she had no idea he was like that. Oh, I was also hit by a 40 year old like 20 minutes later! And of course I had to find the first guy again where he would insist on his offer.\n\nI know I’m not alone in having creepy encounters, but I’ve started to realize that maybe it’s not just random. I have soft, round features, I smile a lot, I like to dance, and yeah, I’ve got big boobs. So, maybe I'm getting a lot of this negative attention because of the way I look and the way I express myself. The thing is, I love the way I dress, and I love who I am, and I refuse to change myself because of some creeps. Not when it took me years to love myself, especially after battling years of deppression and suicidal ideation.\n\nStill, I sometimes think about losing weight because I want to wear the clothes I love without being percieved as \"easy\". I don't think I'm even mid-size, but I’m also not skinny at all. I don't think my outfits are particularly slutty, I think the problem is my body. Like, I genuinely think all the clothes that I love to wear would look less provocative in a thinner body, and I HATE thinking like this.\n\nI’m just so, so tired. I’ve spent the last hour crying because I feel like I’ve gone from being invisible in my teen years to being objectified now that people find me attractive, and both SUCK SO BAD. I know creeps don’t care at all about what you wear or who you are if they really want to do something like this. But I can't help but wonder if the way I look and express myself makes me an easy target for this type of attention. I don't know, I am just so heartbroken and sad and I really want to curse but I don't want the post to get removed lol.",

The whole reason I was suicidal 3 years ago is because everyone from “friends” to family just treated me like shit, I ended up isolating myself and the only reason I couldn’t hang myself was because I couldn’t think of the slightest way to leave my cat without making her unhappy. So I stayed, and everything I do is for her and for art since it’s the only other thing that gives me life.\n\nMy health fell to shit to a point of making me disabled, but even then, I pushed through my dad mocking me instead of helping, pushed through my job fucking with my accommodations, all because I’m getting the fuck far away from it all, because maybe then, I can find people that I can love and care for and do the same for me. \n\nBut that didn’t happen\n\nAll that was waiting for me was the same bullshit, just with a denser amount of fuck faces. I moved to Chicago. You’ll hear all the time in the news about how accepting things are in the face of everything, but it isn’t. Being black means people immediately assuming the worse when they see me, but they’ll preach about my rights to look kindhearted. I’m untrusting, my word means shit. I can’t even find a room to rent because who wants a black roommate that’s a little intimidating looking, yo can scoff, but all it takes is for me to show a little bit of anger and I mean a bit, and I notice people get extremely tense, even if it isn’t directed at them. Like an animal about to go ravage.\n\nI’m sick of hearing all the damn brownie point bullshit, I’m sick of dealing with unprofessional people that legitimately lost an important financial document once and just shrugged it off, I’m sick of working myself to death to prove myself in a world that just wants some fucking validation to feel the way they do about me. Screw dealing with you people, I hate all of you and until the day I find someone I can trust, I wouldn’t blink an eye if the end of the world was tomorrow, I’d spend it with my cat and laugh it off. Because that’s just how meaningless my life is to others, if I killed myself tomorrow, no one would give an actual fuck outside of the people that suddenly give two shits. I bet my dad would fake some tears while he watched me wither away and laughed in my face.\n\nFuck all of you",

Why it's so culturally relevant... I don't understand why so many things are a part of human culture in general, but I guess that's a topic for another time. I usually feel more animal than human. Even more alien than animal.\n\nBut I can't be with anyone because of it. There are other reasons, too, and it's not like I really *want* to be with anyone. I definitely can't see myself settling down, or even dating, and I think that kissing is weird. I have other interests when it comes to my relations with someone, but people find me \"cute\" so often, and it's weird to me. I don't understand it, and it's the fact that they can't explain *why* that irks me.\n\nI don't know what it is that I do that is cute. I don't think that this, what I'm doing here, is cute, and this is also what I do in real life, where people tell me that I'm cute, or sweet, or things like that. The way I see it, I am a deeply physically and mentally ill individual, and that's where it ends, not a lot of points of interest or redeeming qualities to be seen. It's weird to me, but is it just because I'm a weird person? My socialization started *really* late. I might just have a misunderstanding of everything social-related ingrained into my mind.

      "title": "Why Do Anything ?",
      "selftext": "I do not read very often, which will most likely explain the quality of the content herein. What I do read is only what is required of me and nothing more. I often imagine what my mind would be like if I were to spend more time processing and consuming written words. Yet this remains an imaginative exercise, as every feeble, ill-fated attempt to begin a novel fails by the second day.\n\nWhat is it within or about me that prevents the sustained effort required to achieve this goal? I don’t know. This is part of a larger question I ask myself: why do I feel that striving in discomfort, in the service of a larger goal, is most often not worth it? The common refrain that announces loudly in my mind is, *What is the point?* Original, I know. But its banal unoriginality conceals its strong and sinister impact.\n\nLet’s take the very act of picking up a pen to write these words as an example. Why did I do it? I might say it was to organize my thoughts, which may be true, though I don’t claim to know myself well enough to be sure. If this is, at least in part, the case, why did I feel the need to organize my thoughts? And what good does it do, to me or anyone else, for my mind to be tidy?\n\nI often think of the poem *Ozymandias*, which describes the arrogance and misguided beliefs that lead human beings to think their impact will be felt forever. All that was left of Ramesses II’s statue were two legs buried, a face in the sand, and ironic words proclaiming the eternity of his power. But that, too, faded, though it took longer to dim than the impact that you and I will likely make. It faded all the same.\n\nSo where does that leave us? Most of us will never come close to impacting the world around us to the same extent as Ramesses II, for better or worse. It is also certain that whatever impact we make will be washed away, faded, slowly eroded, deleted. Whether in five seconds, minutes, years, or centuries, it will all be forgotten.\n\nFor every war that is stopped with the sacrifice of lives, another starts, in which even more die. For every death camp liberated, a new one opens. For every civil rights issue fought and won, a new one arises. For every evildoer caught and punished, another is born or created. For every good deed done, seven things are done to erase it.\n\nThis leaves me, personally, dejected, sitting in the dark, frozen. What is the point of doing anything if it is guaranteed to disappear? Maybe, just maybe, permanence was never the goal in the first place.\n\nMaybe our job is to reduce as much suffering as possible in everything we do, not *in spite* of the fact that everything crumbles, but *because* of it. Since nothing sustains forever, it is incumbent on us to keep our houses clean, knowing that tomorrow they will be dirty again. It is better to sacrifice and die in the service of others, even if the same fate will befall a future generation.\n\nIt is, in my estimation, more noble to fight a losing battle against impermanence than to surrender and eliminate the possibility of any momentary victories, which only hastens the inevitable decay.\n\nFight the loosing battles.

He didn‘t use any force or threaten me with anything if i didn‘t do it. He kinda just took my hand and put it into his pants. I remember two instances where this happened but as i really tried to forget those moments over the years because i was so ashamed it‘s hard to remember details. I couldn‘t even tell you if it was on the same day or not. \nAll these years i‘ve been so ashamed because i felt so disgusting for participating in „incest“ and i really tried to just ignore those memories. \n\nThis year i realised that i was so young and even if it felt like something that i knew was „bad“ i still didn‘t know what i was doing. I was only 8 or 9. So it‘s not my fault i was the victim. He was 14 or 15 at the time so he KNEW what he was doing. \n\nBut there is this side in me that doesn‘t feel that i‘m allowed to grieve what happened ir be angry about it because i didn‘t stop it, i never said anything, i just let him do it. \n\nI‘m just so lost and i don‘t know how to feel.\n\nAnd no telling family is not an option and talking to him about it neither!! And yes i still see him fairly regularly because our moms are sisters and pretty close. \n\nI just want to get this off my chest and just tell someone because i‘m still too ashamed and confused to talk about it with someone in real life.

I don't come on here to often so please do excuse my poor formatting and please do tell me if you believe this post belongs somewhere else but I just need to put my thoughts into the world somewhere.\n\nOkay- where to start? I (f22) have lived the best part of my life struggling with self doubt and confidence issues, I've had many battles with my mental health and some traumatic experiences that have shaped me into the person I am today. I am proud to have been strong enough to make it out of the other side, but with that has come one big fatal issue. I don't like me.\n\nThis is completely shallow and I know this is going to sound awful, which is why I've elected to do this somewhat anonymously but when I look back on videos, photos etc of how I was when sick - I peaked. I was good looking, slim and I put the effort into my makeup and fashion. And now two years later I'm more stable mentally and in a better position in life - however; late at night everyday I want back my sick body. I want to get worse, I want people to know I'm hurting, I'm not beyond midsize by any means but when i look at myself I feel disgusted with how I look and my tummy, the way my skin folds slightly over the top of tight jeans. I miss the way I felt put together when I wore my makeup, it had nuance and I could wear the mask. Now people expect it from me and I'm just too tired to put on everything in the morning. I want to sleep longer, and hide away. My skin is worse from the stress of work and what I put on myself. And also with my weight gain my boobs have gotten bigger too (as an already well endowed woman) and it makes me self conscious.\n\nAnd even less shallowly - I was recently promoted at work. (yay me) but I'm not really excited i just feel apathetic and anxious. I miss being able to feel the really big extremes of my emotions when i was sick but everything is muted. I'm not sobbing myself to sleep, no, but I'm also not feeling the super big highs of when people praise me anymore. I can't cry and I fear I've not truly healed just covered it over and I'm going to boil over. I just don't know how to get over any of this and I'm hoping putting it into words will make it more real so I can just accept that that part of my life is gone now and to just move on? Maybe I'm also seeking someone to tell me I'm not alone in feeling this? I just need it out of my brain I suppose. Thankyou for listening to the ramblings of a young twentysomethings, and I hope you have the most amazing day.",

      "selftext": "Tomorrow my boyfriend and I (both M btw) have been in a relationship for 8 months. In general it's great! There's honestly just one issue. He's asexual (and completely sex repulsed). \n\nNothing wrong with being asexual of course but it took a few months until I found out about it, in fact I eventually asked him if he's asexual. I think it was 3-4 months in. When we were dating I told him I have a fwb and he has no problem that I keep seeing him. Something that really bothers me in hindsight is that he always had some excuse when I tried to initiate something. This makes me feel lied to. I'd always accept a no, but his reaction was usually a \"not now\" so until I asked him about his sexuality I expected there would be a \"now\" sometime. I think he's experiencing a great amount of insecurity in that regard, maybe he never dared to say it himself.\n\nRecently I tried myself out sexually, met some guys, had great fun but eventually I figured out what was missing. Love. Sex with someone you love is just different and I miss it. \n\nNow I feel kind of stuck. On one hand I have what I want, I have someone in my life I have feelings for, who's genuinely sweet and nice and I have..well my needs met. It would just be great if I got both from one person. \n\nI can't even talk to him about it because I don't want him to feel bad about it. It's not like telling your partner to pick up their dirty socks, he has no control over it and he shouldn't feel bad about being who he is. Also what would be the point? I'd probably just make him feel more insecure.\n\nI guess the easy way would be to break up because we're sexually incompatible but it just doesn't feel right \n ",

      "title": "I’m starting to hate my husband",
      "selftext": "My husband and I have been married for a year, together for three.\n\nThere’s so many reasons why I feel the way that I do, but here’s to name a few.\n\nWhen I was pregnant with our son he verbally and mentally abused me so much. Even stating multiple times that the baby wasn’t his. He always gave me a hard time for resting and would say things to me like “get off your ass”. Anytime that I would lose my appetite because we were fighting he would accuse me of “punishing our son”. He drove erratic in the car with me multiple times, slamming on brakes a few times. Once we had a fight when leaving my cousin’s baby shower and he made the comment “aren’t you proud of me for not driving crazy” like I should pat him on the back for not being abusive.\n\nFast forward to when our son was about a month old During a fight he said “you’re not nurturing” “I’m scared to leave him alone with you, you’ll probably hurt him” “You can’t even calm him down, the only way that you do it is to put your titty in his face” “You can’t even feed him right” Took my phone when he saw that I was recording the verbal abuse. He weaponizes him by taking him from my arms not giving him to me when I’m asking for him and he’s mad at me. Tells me the reason is because “I’m too emotional” He made threats that he would get full custody multiple times on several occasions during arguments and then denies that he said it. Got in my face and screamed while I was nursing our baby. Has yelled and woke the baby up from a nap/sleep several times. When I tell him to lower his voice he states “I’ll do whatever the fuck I want”\n\nGot passive aggressive when I said I “wasn’t in the mood for sex” I asked him to help me with our son later that evening and he responded “I’m not in the mood”\n\nWe live in my house that I purchased and lived in many years before even meeting him. He’s controlling and has taken over my space. I get in “trouble” when I mess with the thermostat, open a window, or blinds, turn lights on or even clean. (He doesn’t say anything to me but his whole demeanor changes and sometimes he will go behind me and put things back to his liking). Before he lived here, my home was constantly clean. Now I can’t even seem to keep up because every time I clean something he goes behind me and junks it up again. He’s also really bad about starting a project and never finishing it, but leaving a mess where he started it which ultimately leaves me to clean it because he never comes back to it. He invited his parents to stay nights here when they’re in town, although he knows I don’t like it because we are already in cramped corners. I’ve talked to him about this countless times and he doesn’t care what I say because “it’s just how his family has always done it”.\n\nMakes joint decisions on his own. (Example: deciding for the both of us that WE would be his parents care takers when they’re too old to care for themselves) I know this will mostly fall on me.\n\nWhen I spoke to him about this he blew up saying that I wouldn’t have to worry about it because we probably wouldn’t even be together when his parents are old.\n\nHe has picked my family apart multiple times and hides away when they come to visit or just sits in the living room on his phone not interacting.\nHe always gives me a hard time when I invite my family along to things or make plans with them at all.\n\nHe barely helps with the baby. I run on E most of the time but am not allowed to have the slightest attitude ever without it blowing up into a huge fight. Yet when he ever is tired or hungry he acts like a baby about it and throws attitude at me.\n\nHe also says things that aren’t true.\nHe has stated that I yell in front of our son. I DO NOT.\nStates that his parents were the only ones to buy us anything from our baby registry. Absolutely not true. My mom bought a ton of stuff from our registry and my dad purchased the crib and the dresser.\nTells me that our relationship won’t work because I won’t change.\n\nHe’s told me that he hates me multiple times and always threatens divorce.\n\nI used to be a firecracker before I became a mother, dishing his crap back at him and not standing for anything. Now I’m too afraid to stand up for myself because his anger escalates so quickly and I don’t want my son around yelling and fighting.\n\nI’m too afraid to talk to him about how I feel too because he cannot handle it. Instead of owning up to it he gets pissed off says I’m trying to blame him and it always leads to a fight.\n\nHe’s insisted over and over again (when he knows I’m not okay with it) me putting up the value of my house to purchase a home and land. (I won’t) Now he’s trying to move me two hours away from my family for a job that he goes to twice a week. (Most of his work is remote)\n\nI’m scared to leave him because I’m afraid of him even getting joint custody.\n\nI stopped loving him a long time ago, but now I feel like I hate him.",

A month prior to starting to date she had told her close friend that she was still in love with her ex. she has had a very troubled past with another ex with betrayal and all. I have had a very troubled childhood complex trauma and because of this i was able to provide for her financially and in terms of actual efforts but was very anxious and never provided for her emotionally by listening without judgemrnt etc. I always felt like she is still in love with her ex , she was obsessed with him for couple of years and tried to get him. These hurt my ego a lot and every time something broke our relationship she would give up so easily on me. It just felt like no one has ever fought for me to stay in their life. I also admit that I have not treated her right and have called her names a few times. I just felt so helpless and powerless that whatever I do , I could not get that love from her , she wasn't cold to me or anything,  she did show a lot of affection , we had loads of sex but somewhere I wasn't able to satisfy her spiritually , emotionally and that hurt me a lot. And that made me get the feel that im gonna be getting 2nd place none the less.that hurt my ego a lot. I felt a lot of times that she is just settling for me after having a lot of fun in her early age. Now she just wants to be with someone who her parents will approve since we belong to the same community (big deal in india). I feel like I wasted so much time on someone who is stuck on their ex and hasn't moved on yet but the time we spent together was magical or thats what I thought but yesterday she told the time we spent together was okish and it was a bumpy ride which really broke my heart.   Our families were involved but in the end it all feels like a sham and everything was done because I was convenient for her rather than being loved. \n\nPardon me if this isnt very cohesive.",

      "selftext": "I just saw a post about masturbation, and I realized there's finally a place where I can talk about this. I often take really long showers because I can't control the urge to pick off my dead skin, squeeze my pimples, or pluck my ingrown hairs. Eventually, my parents talked to me about it. They asked if I'd been under a lot of stress lately, told me there are plenty of ways to relieve it, and urged me to stop masturbating. I was only 12 at the time! I didn't even know how to spell \"masturbation\"! I told them I just couldn't help wanting to tear at my skin, and that doing it on my freshly showered, damp skin made it easier. But my parents didn't believe me. They were dead set on the idea that I was masturbating and even asked, \"Does it feel really good?\" Without knowing what masturbation was, I thought about whether tearing off my skin felt good. And right then, I somehow concluded that anything that made me feel relaxed and happy must be masturbation...\n\nLater, when I started college and dorm life with roommates, they got drunk one night and started chatting about masturbation (as someone who didn't grow up in a Western society, that was a total wow moment. lmfao I really was a good kid). That's when I found out that picking at dead skin isn't masturbation. It's got its own specific name (something like excoriation disorder, but yeah, it's definitely linked to stress). That same night, I called my parents crying and said, \"Mom, Dad, I really wasn't masturbating.\" They still didn't believe me.\n\nI decided to try masturbating myself based on what I found online, but I had zero reaction. Feeling a bit weird about it, I brought it up during the school's free health checkup. The doctor told me. that 5%-10% of women never experience orgasm in their lifetime, and I'm one of them. But considering I've always been asexual + aromantic, I don't really care. In fact, it felt like a perfect opportunity to prove to my parents that I truly wasn't obsessed with masturbation. So I took the doctor's diagnosis and told them about it, but they still didn't believe me.\n\nNow I'm 25, living a sex-free, romance-free NEET life, and my parents are worried that I'll never get married or have kids, that I won't have a \"normal life\". Every time they say, \"I just want my child to live like a normal person,\" it comes with this vibe of \"Go on, praise me. I'm not one of those parents with warped, sky-high expectations for my kid.\" But their whole idea of a \"normal person's life\" is warped to begin with. It has to involve hitting specific milestones at exact ages, or else it's like your life's trajectory has plummeted into some abyss they can't even fathom.",

I would only get them once every three years or so.\n\nThey used to talk about the newest gaming consoles and video games. I would just stare and wonder what exactly they were talking about.\nMost of my clothes came from charity organizations. I hated wearing them to school because I was afraid someone might recognize them, maybe they once belonged to one of my classmates.\n\nSome food charities would call us once a year to tell us they had some kind of “special food” available, what most people considered normal, but for my family, it felt like a holiday.\n\nWe never celebrated birthdays.\nWe never celebrated holidays.\nWe never celebrated graduations or achievements.\nEach of those moments added another weight to my heart, because I saw all my friends celebrating while I had nothing to celebrate.\n\nMy father was imprisoned right before I entered university. I’m now halfway through medical school, and he’s still in prison.\nI still drive his old broken car, and I honestly don’t know when it’ll finally give up for good.\n\nI’ve lived days without electricity. Days without dinner.\nI see my friends traveling, exploring the world, and I can’t even afford to eat at the cheapest local restaurants.\n\nMoney has exhausted me.\nMoney has broken me.\nMoney is so powerful, stronger than me.\n\nOn my way home today, my mother called and told me she’d been removed from the government’s financial aid program for poor families.\nThat means the only source of income we had is gone.\n\nI laughed on the phone and told her not to worry, that I’d figure something out.\nBut when I hung up, I pulled over to the side of the road and cried.\nI cried like a child who felt wronged by the world.\nI cried for every moment, every memory, every situation that needed money and I had none.\nI cried for myself, for my family, for my life, and for everything I’ve lost.\n",

My mom and sister abandoned me many years ago, and doesn't matter what I do, they have never tried building a relationship with me. My relationships never worked as well. I am always the person that does everything. I text first, I ask to go out, I plan the dates. The most \"equal\" relationship thay I had was 90/10, being 90% of the effort mine. Actually I was thinking here and the only place that she suggested that we went out was actually a finner with her father (so most likely was her father wanting to meet me, not really she suggesting it). If I didn't say \"hey, X place has a new show, we should go there\", I don't think we would ever go out.\nI can say that I have \"friends\", but lately I feel more as acquaintances. We can chat and all, but like, I am not really part of their lives. They never invite me out, I am the one that has to invite them (if they say yes). I always text first, because if I don't, we can literally spend years without talking. I was thinking here, and on my 32 years of life, I have never gone to a birthday party. I sneaked out of work to buy a card for my boss's birthday and I fidn't grab a envelope. When they asked me why, I was just like \"I never got a birthday card. I didn't knew that they had envelopes\". I dpent a week in a mental institution, and when I got my phone back, I didn't had a single text message.  Nobody knew I was gone. \nAlso, I want to make one thing clear, I am trying. I have hobbies, I go out, I interact with people, I take showers, shave, dress fine, brush my teeth, wear deodorant, go to therapy, do sports, do communitary work. I am out there, but after 32 years, nothing. My best friend, someone that I know for 18 years of my life, couldn't be bother to find time to watch a movie with me and hang out after 2 years of me asking him.\nSo here is the thing, I am done. I will give myself 1 year. I will go out 1 time a week for 1 year. After this time, I will turn off my phone for 1 month. If when I turn it on, I don't have a single text message. Not a single call. Not even a \"hey dude, want to talk about your extender car warranty\" I am done. I am selling all my shit, I am donating all my money/what I couldn't sell, I will just leave enough to buy a 🔫 and I will kill myself. I am done.",

      "title": "I met the love of my life through an affair and was too afraid to blow up my life.",
      "selftext": "By all appearances I have a good life - a great job that I secured through a college education, married my high school sweetheart, a few wonderful kids, an idyllic home in a wholesome community.\n\nSomewhere along the way my wife and I drifted apart. She cheated on me once when we were first married, and we worked very hard to get past that. Couples counseling was important and it helped that I'm someone who is very easy to forgive. A feckless people pleaser to some extent.  We made it through the other side and made a life together. I forgave her but in retrospect I don't think I ever fully recovered and don't think I ever will. \n\nI blamed myself for playing a part in her cheating on me. I was distant and lacked emotional intelligence during a very difficult time in her life. I didn't actively do anything to hurt her, but my generally passive and stoic nature made it hard for her to confide in me. So, I positioned our lives so I could provide everything possible to make her happy. I became an avid runner, got in shape, learned how to dress myself, and had a moderate glow up as we transitioned to the part of our lives where we had kids. I excelled in my career and proudly marched my way to the fiscal purgatory of the middle class. Got us new cars, a house, all the creature comforts a millennial family could want. \n\nThings seemed fine, partially because I was always so hyper focused on succeeding. Completing every mission I laid out for myself. That included making sure my marriage didn't fail. \n\nThen at work, I made a friend. She was married too, had a kid around the same age as mine, and we hung out with the same circle of friends. One day she missed out on a lunch with our other friends, so I invited her to lunch on my own. Things started out harmless, more DMs at work, texting occasionally outside of work. Then the chats became more suggestive, more personal. She confided in me how unhappy she was in her marriage. Her husband did nothing - she felt helpless in a life she created but didn't want. I genuinely didn't think her feelings were as strong as they were until she kissed me. We had a short fling, one that confused me because up until then I considered myself happy. I had achieved so many things I had set out for myself to do, so why would I do something so reckless and emotional?\n\nMy friend gave me an ultimatum - either blow up my life for her or I couldn't be a part of it anymore. I knew I wasn't going to ever blow up my life for her. I asked myself if it was because I didn't feel that strongly for her, or if it was because I'd never be able to do something like that to my family. \n\nI suppose that was the driving force for me to actively seek out an affair here, on reddit. Was I now someone who had affairs? Was I that the kind of person I was, or was this a fluke situation with a friend IRL that I just had to experience and move on?\n\nI browsed the appropriate subreddits and eventually made an ad. I got a surprising amount of messages, some of which were thoughtful enough to warrant a response. But nothing really materialized. I was going through a life-or-death family medical emergency and was just about to give up on finding someone when she reached out to me. \n\nI got a message from a woman bold enough to open the dialogue with pictures. She was so beautiful I legitimately thought I was getting catfished. I left the messages on read for a day before deciding to answer. \n\nWe started talking on a separate app and immediately hit it off. We exchanged messages for hours. We connected so deeply and so quickly. We agreed to meet right away in person. It was supposed to just be a quick coffee date. A meet-and-greet. What followed was the most intense, loving relationship I've ever had. We talked every day for hours. I started every day by texting her good morning and ended it by texting her goodnight. My every thought was consumed by her and how perfect we felt together. I opened up to her in ways I never did with my wife, any of my friends, anyone else in my life I had ever encountered. \n\nShe was perfect to me. An infectious smile, deeply blue eyes full of warmth, addictively soft lips. A kind soul, cut from the same cloth - a people pleaser, but one who knew how to emotionally connect with people. We had incredible, mind-blowing sex that I still think about every day. \n\nShe had her reasons for seeking an affair. I understood and sympathized. We fantasized about being together one day. I never felt that way with the friend I previously was intimate with. It never felt real, not like this. It genuinely felt like I found my person.\n\nI had no plan. It was easy to think we could just do that for years and years, until we both worked up the gumption to change our situations. I had no intention of leaving my wife, but I found myself actively thinking about all the different circumstances in which I could somehow be with my newfound soulmate. We saw each other multiple times a week. Spent trips overnight together. We were genuinely and truly happy together. Every moment apart felt like the space between the actual story of our lives. \n\nMy wife had been struggling with alcohol for years. She would go on benders, and it got progressively worse after COVID. Whether or not my affair actually contributed to it worsening further, it did start to become untenable and I eventually blamed myself when she became a danger to me and those around her. Drinking and driving. Binge drinking during the day and passing out before noon. Not attending our kids activities because she blacked out. \n\nIt became too much. I tried not to put it on my shoulders, but I knew eventually I would. I had a hard time facing it head on. This confident handle I had on my life started to crumble slowly. It got to the point where I thought the only way to fix my life was to let go of the only person who really knew me and understood me. \n\nOur relationship wasn't perfect. We both made our mistakes. But she was perfect for me. Every inch of her, inside and out, every word she spoke, every sound she made, every heavy breath she took when we held each other - she was made just for me. \n\nNo one in my situation deserves pity, let alone sympathy. I'll make my life work. I always do. I've never had regrets in my life, not substantive ones anyway. Until now. Not just for myself, thinking about what could have been. But for her, what I put her through, the pain I caused her. And the fact that if I never came into her life, she probably would have already run off with someone else and started building herself a better life. Any other sane man in my situation would have. I know I'll think about her every day for the rest of my life. Some part of me thinks the universe will construct some way for us to cross paths again, as unlikely as it was that we ever met in the first place. That's part of what keeps me going, even if I know deep down it's just a construct in my head. But I will always wonder what could have been. And wish I was with her.  \n\nSometimes I think I'm a sociopath, and that all of my relationships are a reflection of that. Or I say that to myself as a rationalization for what I've done and the decision to carry all that scar tissue all alone. When I'm old and gray, I wonder what I'll think of myself. And if I ever will forgive myself as easily as I've forgiven everyone around me. \n\nI just know no matter what happens, I won't deserve that forgiveness. From me, or anyone else.",

      "selftext": "To start, I want to thank everyone who left a compassionate or supportive response/comment to my last post. My wife and I both appreciated it. I remembered this post after seeing a post elsewhere on here talking about the same enzyme issue my son has.\n\nTHE MOST IMPORTANT THING: My son is thriving. Now that we are aware of his enzyme issue we are able to manage it. He is healthy and has met all his milestones. His doctor is amazing and my wife has been a rockstar. My son will turn three in a couple of months. He is like any other kid his age and he amazes me every day. I love watching him grow up. **My son is alive because of the prescription formula. If we gave him breastmilk (or even regular formula) he would have died.**\n\nI no longer have a relationship with my sister after how she treated my wife. Even after hearing that my son would die if he was given breastmilk instead of the prescription formula she continued to shame my wife. Meanwhile, my wife pumped milk for three months to donate to a local milk bank. She was a badass through this whole thing and never let my sister's stupidity get to her. My sister was 34 years old at the time and she acted like a child. My sister wasn't even a parent and had no idea what having a baby was like. My wife and I no longer live in the same province as my sister so it makes not having a relationship with her easier.\n\nEven though she tried to backtrack once she was called out by me and other people, I can never forget the hell she put my wife through during what was the worst time of our lives. My son almost died before the problem was figured out and my sister publicly shamed my wife and said things that were unforgivable. I don't care if she's changed or is a mother now or whatever. If anyone tries to defend or advocate for my sister I cut them off. My sister is dead to me. I'm grateful to our loved ones who told us my sister was publicly insulting my wife on social media (my wife and I don't have social media) and backed up my wife over my sister.\n\n(I received two really hateful messages last time I posted. One was just rambling nonsense, but the other one troubled me because it was from someone who was verified as a physician elsewhere on here. Even after telling him exactly what was medically wrong with my son, he still insisted that my wife was a bad mother who should be charged for not breastfeeding my son. I blocked him and no longer have the username or messages but I was troubled by receiving a barrage of messages saying my wife should be charged and prescription formula ought to be illegal. I try to let that roll off my back. I turned off the ability to get messages after that.)\n\nMy son is such an amazing little human and my wife is a rockstar. I know those things are more important than my sister or any nasty messages. **I want to give a message to any parent who might be struggling: As long as your baby is being fed, it doesn't matter if it is breastmilk or formula. Fed is best. You are doing amazing. You got this!**",

      "selftext": "Hi. 25 m. \n\nLast Saturday (10/4) I tried to hang myself. But thankfully as a last cry for help or something, I messaged a group chat saying goodbye and that I loved them. \n\nI’m not going to describe how I did it, but it’s an uncommon method and one that I was still able to have my phone near me for a flashlight until I didn’t need it. And then I began to end it all. Right there in the corner of my closet as my cat slept peacefully on my bed. \n\nUntil I got a phone call. And I don’t know why I picked up. But I did. Even with the loop still around my neck but little pressure added. And you guys,\n\nIt was a friend that I’d recently reconciled with after he apologized for some stuff a while back. Not even my best friend (she was busy). But still. It’s always the people you least expect. \n\nAnyways, long story short, I was on the verge of passing out and something in me was able to pull back and move my head out of the noose. But I’d damaged my throat. It was hard to breathe still and when I went to blow my nose from crying, a bunch of blood came out. I went to the hospital with him on the phone. The nurses were so rude and cold. It was the worst fucking day of my life. I was told I did a bit of damage to an artery, squashed a few blood vessels and some other stuff I can’t remember right now. Eight hours later I found myself in an ambulance being driven to a mental health facility. I sobbed for so long, trying to get them to let me go home. But guys. I fell asleep after a huge cry, woke up and reached this like, radical acceptance. I decided I would do anything. Anything to feel better again. I didn’t care about going home anymore. I just wanted to stop being so miserable and be myself again. The myself I hadn’t been since I was ten, fifteen nearly sixteen years ago. And five days after that, I was home again. \n\nIt was harder than I thought. I still can’t go in my closet. I have physical and emotional triggers that literally incapacitate me. Make me shake with fear. I see “ghosts” of myself all over. Crying here, walking around sad there. Not hallucinations, just like, intrusive thoughts maybe? Or realizations that I’m different now? It’s so weird. But I feel like when I was ten, I was swapped with some evil, cold, sad version of myself. And coming so close to death made me able to “open the portal” and come back. To WANT to come back. \n\nAnd I’m not here to tell you it gets better. Because it doesn’t. It gets tolerable. Then life sucks again. But I’ve learned it’s how we DEAL with it. So please, message me the word “dolphin” and I’ll send you all my resources that I learned in therapy. Just know I’m not here to respond to anything I need to play therapist for. I’m on my own healing journey. But I want to share what I learned because genuinely, it has helped me so much. The CBT triangle, coping skills- yes more than you say you have. Putting things in perspective. Treating yourself how you would treat a friend. COMMUNICATION! \n\nI’m a brother again. I’m a son again. I have a want to live again. And am I happy all the time? Fuck no. But can I handle that? Yes. Yes I can. And you can too. I love you. ",

Part of me thought she was just being honest about life, but now that I’m older it feels off that a teacher would say something like that to teenagers.\n\nDo you think she was trying to motivate us or was that just an inappropriate thing to say to students?",

But even so I totally get those concerns and will always have conversations about that.\n\nMy issue is Everyone tells me I’m secretly miserable/bored or says “it’s not fair” it’s our marriage, so thank god you don’t have to do it I guess\n\nLike what do you mean😭 I LOVE cooking, it’s my favourite thing. I cook us 3 meals a day, and pack his lunch. I have a movie in the background, my comfy clothes on and could spend the entire day cooking and baking. I love to clean, I even love doing laundry and making the bed and getting our home cozy\n\nWe live in Beverly Hills so I go to farmers markets daily and year round, and there’s tons of things to keep me busy.\n\nBabies had to be put off for a bit due to my PMDD diagnosis which I am sad about however, I’m SO excited to be a mom.\n\nAnd the thing is with the “it’s not fair” is HE wanted this too. He does not think it’s unfair he pays bills and I don’t because he doesn’t cook or clean. He has a very busy job, and if we were both busy it would suck. Not to mention he likes it when I travel with him for business which I couldn’t do with a job\n\nI was miserable when I worked. Used to work in a factory and dreaded life… Everyday I wake up excited. I am so incredibly happy, tomorrow I get to make breakfast, pack his lunch, then I get to go to the salon for most of the day and it’s the most amazing salon ever he got me a membership at. I’m going to get all pretty and then I get to go to the grocery store and cook dinner\n\nAnd on Tuesday get to do it again except instead of the salon I am going to the mall/farmers market and it’s going to be so fun and I love going on Pinterest, finding recipes and then shopping for them. Also on Tuesday I’m going to look for donut recipes and other treats so I can bake them to bring to man’s business for him and all his employees the are always so nice to me and love my treats and I love ittt\n\nIm so excitedddddd.\n\nAnd of course I’m not saying this life is for all women, and that you guys are miserable working. I get it we’re all different and I hope you live the life you want!! \n\nBut I’m happy for the first time ever!! Literally first time ever. I have a safe home, no schedule and get to live life and be happy everyday!! I used to have so much anxiety and it is all gone. I swear my hair and skin and teeth are healthy because of it. ",

Last month I borrowed some money from her account and I totally intend to pay it back as soon as I get my paycheck. However, I wasn’t supposed to touch that. That was from her pension account, my sister and I are yet to get the money from her insurance, we’re about to start the proceedings on monday and I just realized we have to get a bank statement from her account. See, I took the money to pay our light bill as it was the last day, I had no money and neither did she, she asked me to use my credit card but it was blocked so the only thing i thought to solve it was to take money from that account and pay it back this week. I know i have to pay it back and I will, but i’m so scared of how my sister will react. She’s been a walk her whole life, i’ve been dealing with anxiety and depression since my mom died some years ago, I can’t talk to her about anything deep, and i’m afraid she’ll stonewall me or worse. Maybe it’s my anxiety and overthinking, maybe I just know her that well to be right about being scared. Besides, she’s pregnant so her emotions are through the roof right now. I don’t know, I don’t even know what i’m writing anymore. For me it’s a huge problem with a real solution, but i’m literally dying and with a huge pain in my chest. I’m so sorry for rambling, but i needed to get it out. I’m so lost and lonely, I have no friends and she’s my only family. I’m such a disappointment.",

      "title": "Weirdest / most unwelcome toddler bday of my life",
      "selftext": "My 2-year-old daughter was invited to her classmate’s birthday party this weekend. I don’t really know the family because our kids go to daycare together, but my husband usually does drop-off and pickup, so I wouldn’t recognize the parents. I thought it would be a nice chance to meet them and let the kids play. I RSVPd and the mom seemed excited we were going and seemed very kind.\n\nWhen we got to the house, I rang the doorbell once but no answer. Now I don't know these people so I figured it would be best to ring and not just enter (there was also no sign saying come in or even that it was a bday party, which was weird). I double-checked the address, waited a bit, and rang again. A man finally opened the door, looking completely irritated. I asked if it was Ava’s party and he just said “yes” in this annoyed tone, then walked away.\n\nWe went inside, set the gift down with the others, and walked out to the backyard where everyone was gathered. There were quite a few adults there, but not a single person said hello, smiled, or acknowledged us. I think the mom or maybe an aunt saw me and looked right past me. The most bizarre thing was it appeared whenever I went to an area with my daughter if a mom was there with her kid, they would suddenly leave. I felt some parent was giving me dirty looks from across the playground, but shrugged it off due to squinting in the sun or something.\n\nIt was so uncomfortable. I didn’t even know who the parents were. I only knew which child was the birthday girl because she was wearing a shirt with her name on it. I guess I expected the mom to see a mom with a toddler and welcome us, introduce us to some people, or offer us a drink. Nope.\n\nWe hung around for maybe thirty minutes while my daughter kind of wandered near the toys. No one ever came up to us. Eventually I spotted the birthday girl with (I think) her grandmother, and I told her happy birthday and that we were leaving. She looked a little sorry that we were going. I told her which gift was from us and that it didn't have a name tag, and left. Grandma apologized (which was weird since all I did was say happy birthday and if I could leave through the gate). She began asking me questions, and I kind of answered them awkwardly as I was leaving since I was on the verge of tears at that point.\n\nLater that day, I sent the mom this text:\n\n“Hi, this is Rachel, Chloe's mom from daycare. We stopped by the party today and dropped off a red gift bag with a tea set and a sticker book, but it didn’t have a name tag. It’s from her. Thanks.”\n\nShe never replied. Not even a quick “thank you” or “glad you came.” Nothing. Maybe it came off as a little rude since I was pretty annoyed by that point. This text was sent about 4 hours from the incident and no thank you or sorry we missed you text had been sent yet. She still hasn't acknowledged my text.\n\nWhen I looked back at the old text thread where she’d sent the invite, I realized the photo that shows up next to her name (a wedding picture) might have shown her husband... so maybe the man at the door was the dad...but, it was such a tiny thumbnail that I couldn’t even tell.\n\nI keep replaying the whole thing in my head because it was just so bizarre. I’ve never been made to feel so unwelcome at something we were invited to (or even a party I was attending with someone). It reminded me of that tiktok story about the rude neighborhood party. I left feeling embarrassed, confused, and kind of stunned.",

      "title": "My life is falling apart and it’s all my mom’s fault",
      "selftext": "Okay, to get some things out of the way, this spans SEVERAL years, and at the time of this being posted, I am 16F. The ages of my parents aren’t important, but my dad recently turned 40, and I think my mom is about 38. I have 4 younger siblings, they are 6M, 5F, 4F, and 2F.\n\nThis was all in the span of a year so some of the details might blend together, for that I’m sorry.\n\nMy mom has been cheating on my dad for YEARS. The first time it ever came to light was when I was about 9-10 years old. She was talking to me about going out with some man, and I said that she couldn’t do that without dad, she said that my dad already knows and to “go ahead and tell him”. I guess she thought that I wouldn’t catch her bluff, and so I told him. Lo and behold, he had no idea, and confronted her. My mom said that what she had ACTUALLY said was that she was going to take ME out but wouldn’t because my grades were low, and my dad believed her, causing him to scream at me. Later, he soon came to discover that she was lying, and she was cheating on him. He then apologized to me.\n\nThere were two other incidents, one was when another man (that my mom was sleeping with) brought groceries to our house, and is worth mentioning but far less dramatic, and another where when I was doing math homework at the dinner table while my father was at work, I had decided to go through her phone instead of using the calculator. I had found nudes being sent to my mom by another man that wasn’t my father. Because this was so close to the previous incident where my father didn’t believe me, I didn’t say anything.\n\nTime Skip to now. My parents never had a perfect relationship, I’ll admit. I’d come downstairs to ruined walls and screaming matches more times than I could count, but I loved them regardless. I was always a fan of Greek mythology and old literature, and I always saw my dad as King Odysseus and my mother as Queen Penelope; two people who were damaged but still managed to love each other regardless. That is, until December of last year.\n\nLast year, my aunt, whom we’ll call A (for aunt) was staying in our home because she and my cousin (C; 16F) were struggling. They would stay in our home until they could get back on their feet and I was excited to see my cousin. My mom had spread a lot of rumors about my Aunt A and how she was a terrible mother who abandoned her kids, and so me and my dad were skeptical around her. However, she had proved herself to be hardworking and generous to me and my siblings even if I was distant towards her. After a while, I even began to like her. My dad too. Now, during this time, my mom was in Vegas for a business trip, and wouldn’t return until January, so it was just me, my siblings, my cousin, dad, and aunt.\n\nMy mom had been acting strange during this time, asking me to go and “check on” my dad and aunt whenever they were around each other. My dad had wanted to get to know my aunt more, and so took her out to bars and such to simply hang out. Keep in mind that my MOM is the serial cheater, not him. Plus my dad would never do that, he loves my mom and his kids too much. I knew that. But my mom would always blow up his phone and watch them via the nannycams we had throughout the house.\n\nAs time went on, the truth got revealed. A while back on a girls trip with my mom and both aunts, my mom had ONCE AGAIN cheated on my dad in FRONT of both aunts. Aunt T (the second one) kept up her guard and stayed silent, but Aunt A couldn’t let my dad stay ignorant, and told him. Which was what my mom was afraid of. He confronted my mom, and said that as long as she apologized, everything would be okay. However, she refused. My mom was being EXTRA cold during this time, forcing me into JROTC even though I didn’t want to. This may seem like regular dumb mom things to you, but I’d beg and plead with my mom to change it, and she’d say no. She said she’d change it at the end of the semester, she didn’t. For the first time in my life I considered skipping class because being in that stupid class was genuinely torture. I hated everyone inside the class and everything about it. So much so that in the beginning of the next semester, I had one of the worst panic attacks of my life inside the JROTC bathroom just at the thought of having to do this over again. When my mom DID finally take me out, she said she’d cut my phone off, take away all my art thing, take away my laptop so that I couldn’t write, and just punish me for not having fun in the class I didn’t have fun in. That’s when the cat started the claw its way out the bag.\n\nMy mom’s cheating came to light, she came back home and was noticeably different, it was like she stopped caring about her family entirely. Then, she said that my dad had to pack his bags and go. I thought it was another bluff, it wasn’t, but even still I immediately made the decision to stay with my dad. And since then, everything got worse.\n\nThe stress was getting to me, and my mom seemed hellbent on destroying my family. She didn’t care about anything. My dad had even made a point about me killing myself because of everything, and my mom laughed and responded with “we have life insurance”. A couple days later, my mom randomly burst into my dad’s room (I was in there playing Spider-Man) and told me to pack my things. I called my dad and got my cousin, and we hid in our room, but my mom broke in and dragged us out the house while my cousin called the police. The police came, we wrote our statements, and my dad managed to break back into our own house.\n\nLots of things happened in between then (February) and now (October) but here are the last handful of incidents.\n\n\n•\t⁠My dad got a protective order against my mom, and in response she got a court order. My aunt T is a lawyer so that’s probably where she figured out how to override a protective order. She came to my school to pick me up instead of my dad, and a CPS worker came to show me off as me and my cousin hid in the office. I went with my mom where she told me I’d never see my dad again as she picked up my siblings. I hid in the bathroom at home until my mom forced me to get out, and told me to give her my phone (which I didn’t have) but I did have a watch my cousin gave me to call 911. My mother PHYSICALLY fought me for the watch, and even tried to close a door on my hand and choke me out in a bathtub (not full of water) I ran back home and my aunt called the police. My mom then tried to force her way inside my home (we both moved, so this is different building, an apartment complex. She lived in an actual house owned by the same company about 10 minutes away)\n\n•\t⁠She told lies about my father being abusive, even claiming to have bruises from the abuse. However, I WAS THERE during the “dates” the abuse happened. There was no makeup. There was no scarring. There was nothing.\n\n•\t⁠My mom offered to help pay for my sweet 16 (which was originally going to be with my whole family) but afterwards, started going online and crying \nabout my father “cheating on her”\n\n•\t⁠She would continuously harass and go to our apartment to stalk us, doing everything in her power to terrorize me and my dad and aunt (who was also staying with us since she would be homeless without my dad)\n\n•\t⁠She took child support from my father. That would be fine if it was just from my 4 younger siblings, but she is claiming child support from ME AS WELL. I DON’T LIVE WITH HER.\n\n•\t⁠She made it so that for a week my dad couldn’t see or be in the same house as me. I had to stay at a friend’s house for at least 5 days I believe until my dad was able to get it so he could see me again (shoutout to Olivia ily you’re literally my best friend)\n\n•\t⁠Even now, when my dad is trying to form a coherent schedule, she is inconsistent, noncommunicative, and just “surprises” me and my dad by dropping the kids off without warning. This isn’t a bad thing, I love my siblings, but I also would like a decent time frame as to when they get here and how long. I just want consistency.\n\nThe reason why I’m posting this here is because a while back, my mom was posting a series of TikTok videos where she was spreading lies and misinformation about my dad. She said that my dad cheated on her and left her for my aunt when that isn’t the case. She said that he abused her when that isn’t the case. It was severely impacting my dad’s job where I was genuinely scared he could be fired. I was scared kids at my school or teachers would see it. (My mom was very involved with the school, and I look EXACTLY like my mom. Just a younger version of her.) She has since stopped, but didn’t take the videos down. I dmed a bunch of people in the comments that took my mom’s side to try and get them to see the truth, but they all just thought I was my aunt. I feel like I should have made this post in the heat of everything, but I didn’t have Reddit, but I’ve been obsessed with Reddit stories lately and decided that I might as well tell my story here.\n\nI’m just so tired. I look back at all the wonderful memories I had with my mom and wonder if they were real, if she actually loved me or if I was just some kind of contract between me and my dad. I feel sick thinking about my mom. I want the mom I thought I knew back. I miss my old house, and i hate this small apartment we’re in now. We don’t even have any FURNITURE. Because we don’t have any MONEY. I miss my siblings. I miss them coming into my room and waking me up and then me making them pancakes even though i was tired. I miss being able to get actually annoyed with them instead of me missing them and dreading it when they leave. I miss my old life when my biggest issue was math instead of if my mom is going to act crazy again or if my dad’s body can’t handle the stress of it all and he dies in his sleep. I just want my life back. This all happened so fast and I don’t even feel alive anymore. I’m just numb. My home doesn’t feel like my home and I want an actual bed instead of a mattress on the floor. I don’t know what I did to deserve hint I hate everything. I don’t even want to be alive anymore because my biggest supporter and reason for doing what J love (my mom and siblings) aren’t with me. I still have my dad, and I love him more than words can describe, but I miss my mom so much. I want my old mom back.\n\nMom, if you’re reading/hearing this. I hate you right now. I don’t know what went through your mind when you did this, but I hate you. I love you too, but that hate will always be with me. I will never forgive you for this and I don’t want to see you again until I am an adult and able to properly be able to handle the emotions that come with whatever the hell happened this year.\n\nDad, if you’re reading this, I cannot thank you enough. This woman has destroyed us and yet you never gave up on me, and I don’t want to give up on you. Thank you for everything and I love you.\n\nAunt A, if you’re reading this, I want to thank you too. You have truly done so much for me and my dad even when you didn’t have to, and I recognize everything. I may not be the best at expressing it vocally, but I can write out how I feel, and I thank you so much for everything. I’m so sorry the world has done you dirty but I see you and recognize the person you really are.\n\nAnyone else on my mom’s side (particularly my grandma and Aunt T), Go to hell. You don’t even deserve a full paragraph. You all suck.",

      "selftext": "I need to get this out.\n\nFour years ago, I lost my mom to suicide. That single event completely turned my whole life upside down. It’s just me, my dad, and my older brother now. Our extended family cut ties with us after her death, and we’ve been on our own ever since.\n\nAfter losing her, my dad was never the same. He needed care and support, but I was too young to understand how to give it. My brother seemed to move on quickly... performing at school, reciting poems, acting like nothing happened. Once, he even smashed his tablet with a hammer after my dad scolded him for gaming too much. My dad was in disbelief. He said my brother could’ve given it to me... I only had an old vivo y16 phone that barely worked.\n\nFast forward to today, things are even harder. My brother has a job, but instead of helping my dad, who’s been struggling financially, he spends everything on himself...clothes, gadgets, food. My dad and I keep wearing the same old clothes year after year.\n\nMy dad talks about my brother ALL THE TIME, how disappointed he is, how much we’re struggling. Every conversation somehow turns back to him. Hearing about our financial problems every day has made me afraid to ask for even basic things I need. When I do, he repeats the same things until I regret asking at all.\n\nMeanwhile, my brother lives freely, hanging out with friends, buying what he wants, acting like we don’t exist. In these four years, my dad has attempted suicide twice. I live in fear. Scared to upset him, scared to speak up, scared of losing him too.\n\nHe often vents everything in front of me. I’m 17, still figuring out life, but I feel like I’ve had to grow up too fast. I’ve deleted all my social media because he doesn’t like it. I try to help in every way I can, but it never feels like enough. Most days, I just feel like a burden. I don't know what to do now. I have stopped talking to my brother completely, we are still living under the same roof, but I ignore him completely, I don't care about him at all. \n\nI feel like crying when I see other families having fun, siblings fighting with each, but like normal kids. I don't know why my mom did what she did, neither my dad does, we still miss her... I keep having these same dreams over and over again where I see that my mom has came back, like she just went out for a while and now she is back and everything is normal. I have never shared all of this with anyone... But I felt  like I should or this burden and stress would eat me alive.",

      "selftext": "My mom succumbed to dementia early last year, so afterwards my grandma recommended these lawyers so I sued the nursing home due to various forms of neglect. I just now received a settlement check from the sorry ass nursing home. My mom’s insurance just had enough to cover her service and burial, but the tombstone wasn’t in the bundle. They quoted my family almost 3k and we did not have that money. So now with part of the settlement money I got my mom a beautiful tombstone. I also lost my job then my car was repoed so I was facing financial hardships. I got a new car then I gave my grandma 10k. After getting the tombstone, the car, paying my grandma, taking care of a few expenses, giving 2 family members a few 100 bucks towards their rent, and putting a portion into savings account, ima just say I’m working with like 30k left. I’m also ubering and doing doordash until I’m able to find a steady job/career again. However my grandma is harassing me for more and keeps throwing my dead mother (her daughter) up in my face. First she said “you don’t think about your mom, all you think about is money.” Then she called me again and said “that’s why your mother said you should’ve never been born, you care about money more than me, I deserve more money!.” So to avoid snapping at her and disrespecting her for disgusting words, I blocked her and cut contact. My grandma has helped me a lot but I NEVER borrowed near 10k from her!! So I feel that was more than fair!! I still have to pay my rent, car insurance, phone etc…and like I said I’m literally doing uber I don’t have stable income right now!! Ever her kids and my other family members told me she was wrong and to block her!! She’s letting greed lead her into losing her grandchild. (Also my grandma gets several checks monthly, she’s not rich but she’s not struggling either!!)",

We would call and text when we could timezones and life permitting. We gamed together, we share playlists, we were a part of each others lives. Then we tried to make it work as friends knowing that we couldn’t be together because of my marriage (to a woman I do love as well) and child, her situation at home with children and being in the other side of the world.\n\nWe tried to make it work and still be in each others lives but it was upsetting her core values and we couldn’t hide the fact we fell in love and it felt right but wrong. We never intended for it go this way we just naturally fell into it. So 20 days ago we broke off contact to heal ourselves.\n\nNow I’m sat here loving her from a far while allowing her the time to heal and see where her journey takes her. I wish her all the happiness in the world but am struggling to let her go. She is my person and we always said “One Day” date would bring us together again and I still hope it does. I don’t know how I got here loving two women but knowing one is the one who allowed me to be the real me and I feel so deeply for and I don’t know what to do. I am seeking therapy to help resolve this but I’ve had no one to tell.

This is just me trying to to come to terms with everything \n\n And have been through most of the common antidepressants on the market. Zoloft and Lexapro? Locks me in with my depression and allows it to torment me. Prozac just does nothing but make me angry and restless. Buspar gives me brain zaps and makes my heart race. Wellbutrin helps but causes me horrible migraines which makes me want to die more. Effexor is the newest med on the chopping block.\n\n Its helping but I still want to passively die. I do a combination of meds and therapy to try and couple with it. But no matter how well the medication works, I always want to die. Passively or actively planning. Even from when I was Elementary school, I remember hoping and praying to go to bed and never wake up. \n\nTalking with my therapist this last week, he brought up the point that maybe my depression is medication resistant. And it clicked. Maybe there isnt a perfect med for me. One that makes all the depression go away, like I know there is for some people. \n\nBut with that knowledge, its easier to fight for my life. To fight the depression that sometimes feels like a another person in my mind, hanging around like a shadow. Whispering to me, talking in my ear. Pointing out maybe the fact that my mother loves me and treats me similarly to her dog. Or how I'll never be anyone's first choice in life, especially not my dad's or my mom's. \n\nBut that's okay. I'm a Hella good friend, my coworkers love me, my cats are spoiled rotten and always have the best I can physically offer. My therapist is on speed dial and he's great. \n\nMy depression will always try to kill me. And someday it will. But not right now. ",

      "selftext": "I went to college at a very conservative school that was about an hour from where I grew up. I didn’t really fit in there, but I had a circle of friends who were kind of like me, and it was all right. One of those friends was a girl that I hung out with. We slept together and had sort of a fwb type relationship for a while. Our junior year she got pregnant by this guy who came from one of the big name families at the school. Very self righteous and all that. I don’t think she ever told him because he’d already ditched her after they slept together the one time. In fact, he denied that they ever even had sex. Instead she came to me and told me, and my heart absolutely broke for her. She was terrified to tell her parents, but she’d told her older sister who encouraged her to terminate the pregnancy before anyone knew. It just so happened that my parents were going to be out of town a week or two later, so we talked, and she scheduled an appointment at the clinic in my hometown. I told her that if she didn’t want to have an abortion that I’d do whatever I could to help her out. She could have even moved into my parents’ house if she’d needed to, but she didn’t want to lose her relationship with her family. \n\n\nWe drove down to my house Thursday night, and I took her to the clinic the next morning, then back home, and I put her in mymy sister’s old room, which was right across the hall from mine. We spent the weekend alone, just the two of us, while she recovered, and I did everything I could to ease her pain, both physically and emotionally. On Monday, we went back to campus, and acted like nothing happened. I never felt comfortable telling anyone because I felt like it wasn’t my story to tell. I only ever told my best friend after he noticed that we had both disappeared for the same weekend and figured we’d just shacked up all weekend. I told him that it wasn’t like that, that she’d been sick and just needed to get away, but he put it together. \n\n\nI know it wasn’t an easy decision for her, and she was never the same after that. I guess I’m telling it now just to say that it’s easy to judge people, but unless you’ve been in her shoes, you don’t know what she was going through. \n\n",

      "selftext": "I’m a 30 year old male. My father is overall a good father by most standards.\n\nHe worked really hard to provide for my family and allow my mom to be a stay at home mom. He provided a nice, stable, loving environment for me and my sister growing up. Upstanding citizen and community leader. \n\nBut I guess the older I’ve gotten the more I’ve seen his flaws and realize he’s not perfect. He owns his own business. Kinda like a family business. And I kinda feel life has revolved around this business our whole lives. Most of the time I spent with him growing up was helping him with the family business. \n\nI have my own career now and though he’s never said it out loud, I know he’s really disappointed I’m not continuing the family business. And it’s not even that I don’t like the business. It’s that I couldn’t handle working with him. I’d never tell him that cause I know it would break his heart. \n\nOf course being a good worker is important and some stuff is time sensitive but he just took everything so seriously. It was too much about the hustle and if I wasn’t fast enough or good enough or messed something up he’d get mad and I just got tired of never being able to satisfy him and make him proud of me. I literally have a note in my phone from 9 years ago reminding me never to take up the family business. Cause when things are going good sometimes I think about it but I feel like we are better off if we aren’t that close every day. \n\nLater in life my mother mentioned that back when I took swimming lessons when I was like 6 or so the swim instructor said I was really good and wanted to get me onto a team somewhere. I don’t remember this. But they didn’t end up doing it and I think it was mainly because of my dad’s work and them not having time to shuttle me all around to practices and meets. I still like swimming and I never had many friends growing up and I wonder if this would’ve been a great opportunity for me. \n\nA few months ago me and him and my brother in law went fishing together. And like usual my father did 95% of the talking. Like he always does. He always has a story of something that happened to him. Can never get a word in myself. Occasionally he will point out that I’m so quiet and ask if I have anything to say. And I say no cause he clearly doesn’t actually care and goes right back into his next story 10 seconds later. \n\nAfter fishing we went to a restaurant. And once when my father went to the restroom my brother in law started talking to me. My wife and I were expecting our first child at this time and he was asking me questions about how things were going and I was just like wow this is the most I’ve talked all day and someone actually wants to hear what I have to say. \n\nSo anyways. I know a lot of people have had it a lot worse. I don’t doubt my father cares about me. But the older I get the more I see his flaws and there are things I don’t like about him and I do kinda wish he would’ve invested in my interests more as a kid rather than it all being about the family business. And there are definitely things I’m going to do better as a parent. ",

      "title": "My boyfriend is obsessed with me getting a job and it’s ruining our relationship",
      "selftext": "Relatively recently I was diagnosed with SLE after years of severe, unusual, debilitating symptoms which some days left me bed bound due to the sheer degree of physical and mental exhaustion I was going through.\n\nWithin the last month I’ve had a flare up which had  primarily consisted of migraines, agonising pains throughout my bones all over my body, vision issues/vertigo and fatigue so bad that without an alarm I’ve been sleeping some days 12-16 hours without interruption yet still waking without a shred of energy. My boyfriend of two years (and the only boyfriend I’ve ever had/first relationship) is aware of my health issues, and my latest bought of symptoms, yet beyond a few “I hope you feel better soon babes” continues to push me to find a job every single day. I bring in money currently through disability and also a part time online admin job which he claims is not real employment as it doesn’t bring in what his pay-check does, and that I’m lazy for “sponging off the government” in terms of my disability payments.\n\nAfter two days during which I was unable to walk due to a nauseating, pounding headache over my eyes and unable to keep food down, he calls me in the middle of his work shift to inform me that he’s spoken to his boss and that they are able to provide me employment the next morning. I try to tell him without wanting to sound ungrateful that I don’t believe I’m capable of doing it, as the department I was assigned to was all day, on your feet assembly work. He ignored me essentially, saying that he wants to buy a house as he can’t stand living with his mother any longer and that me “not allowing my negative mind to win” will help us to build both our futures. To please him and avoid an argument I went in for two days and unknown to him, and after completing the second afternoon I was experiencing pins and needles all over, unable to stand properly, had distorted vision and a blood nose as well as vomiting. I told him all of this only again for him to say how proud he was of me for making it through the day and that I’m on my way to changing my life by growing up. He believes that my symptoms are a result of being at home too much and general depression, not really an actual autoimmune condition. \n\nHe said if I don’t want to go in he will literally drive to my house in the mornings in order to pick me up and force me there essentially. I feel fucking trapped. He’s a decent guy with a go getter mindset, albeit with a gambling problem that I wasn’t aware of until later in the relationship and seems to be getting worse by the day and rare though bad episodes of binge drinking where hell without warning consume 12 cans of beer or spend his whole paycheck at the pub, but he’s making me feel like an idiot who’s not in control of myself or second guessing my own symptoms despite literally enduring them daily. I don’t know what to do, I love him and don’t want to hold him back but I can’t stand being pushed every single day to work or being lectured about not having a real job day in and day out. I’m starting to hate him, yet I’m scared of losing him and the only real love I’ve ever had before. ",

      "selftext": "the title is straightforward and is the best one i could think of that perfectly summarizes how i'm feeling. i just turned 18 this year, and my mental health has definitely deteroriated for the worst. \n\nfor some background, i wasn't a planned pregnancy. my mother told me i was an accident when i was young (don't know why she decided to do this but whatever) and every now and then i've been thinking about it. but it keeps coming back in my head more recently.  i was diagnosed with bpd (bipolar personality disorder) when i was 14 years old. to be honest, i consider myself lucky in a way for not being the type of daughter to lash out or have very violent outbursts. but it hurts me a lot to just keep quiet. i'm so used to keeping to myself because i just feel guilty for even being upset or just the thought of feeling in general makes me guilty. i was also called the spoiled brat of the family because my parents were a bit more generous to me than to my siblings. so ever since i've acknowledged the difference in how our parents used to treat me compared to my siblings, i just feel guilty. it feels like my existence is a curse.\n\nmy family probably doesn't mean to make me feel this way, but they always make me feel stupid. if i said that they explain things to me like i don't know about it already, you might think i'm just being a brat. but they explain it to me like i'm a stupid child. they explain things only based on surface-level knowledge. when i complain about something in college, i always hear \"it's always like that anyway\". when i open up or talk in general, they either don't even bother to care about it by the annoyed look on their face, or the dismissive tone. or they're busy doing something, or i get interrupted.. or they look at me like i'm crazy. or they make it obvious i'm talking so much.\n\ni hate asking for help too, especially from my mother. this happens mostly from my mother but it happens from everybody else. whenever i ask for help, like help looking for something or anything.. my mother always looks annoyed, sighs loudly, and gets on with it. while she does so, she makes comments about how i really should learn how to take care of myself and i'm always so clumsy and so dirty. but i always try to clean my room, but of course the progress is slow. because i take it one step at a time. what's funny enough is they encourage me taking one step at a time but then they rush me anyway, call me dirty and literally just tell me i don't know how to do things. so i hate asking for help because i just feel like i'm bothering my family.\n\nso i just feel like such a huge burden. i feel guilty for being the way that i am, for just existing in general. i feel angry at my mom, but not for all the other things she's said or done to make me feel like the dirt on their shoe, but moreso angry for why she pushed through with me. like i mentioned, she told me i was an accident when i was younger.. and now i'm just upset she pushed through with me. i want to die, but if there was a choice, i'd rather to be never being born. i feel like life is such a cruel joke, and i'm the punchline. i feel really alone at home, and i really only rely on the company of my cats. my siblings are closer, and my older brother said i'm the sensitive gen z while he wasn't like it. my sister and my brother's humor matches, and my parents are obviously their own team.. so i'm practically alone. \n\ni just started college this year, and i love it there more than my own house. i just feel guilty for so much. i feel guilty for feeling emotions, for crying, just for being here. i keep repeating the words guilty, but it really is how i'm feeling. \n\ni have always had trouble acknowledging my feelings are valid, because my family makes it hard to. i've always felt guilty for being part of their family and that my presence is just a cruel joke or just pathetic. they always convince me that i'm not a burden, but their actions and demeanor says a lot.\n\ni have no idea on what to do, and i hate how ive been feeling this way for-fucking-ever. i want to die, but i know i have so much to offer.. i'm just not sure if i'm able to go on.

      "title": "Apparently being 18 in your first relationship means its invalid and not real love",
      "selftext": "So I’m honestly how to feel about this. Me(18m) and my boyfriend(18m) we're talking about this vacation coming up that he invited me on, but some issues came up. Apparently it’s not even their family’s trip. It’s his dad’s coworkers’ trip that his family was invited to. His sister invited her boyfriend and they’re both paying for themselves and have their own room. They are older than us and live together, but his parents are only paying for his dad, mom, and him. \n\nThis trip was planned like a year or two ago, and they said it might be tricky adding me now. But honestly the cruise isn’t until next year. We still have a whole year to go, and I feel like that’s enough time for most cruise lines since they usually accept new people up until a few months before departure if there are still rooms available. So if they check now, it should still be fine. I’m just hoping they’re willing to at least try.\n\nIf not, it’s totally okay. It would just show that we can handle things with maturity and understanding as long as we talk about it. We can always try another time or go on a trip that’s more manageable.\n\nMoney-wise, it’s kind of really expensive. I’d have to pay for my own cruise ticket, which is around $2k. With flights and everything else, it would probably come out to around $7k total. That feels like a lot for one person. I’ve been on plenty of cruises and trips before with my family, out of state and even out of the country, and I don’t remember it ever being that expensive. But his mom agreed to get more info from his dad and call my mom on the phone about all the details and such and other concerns. Which I thought was a really good step for us.\n\nMy parents are already paying for my expensive university, while my boyfriend’s parents don’t have to worry about tuition since he goes to community college. The good thing is my parents have a ton of travel points for flights and hotels, so maybe they could help cover my flight with points or something, just to make it more doable.\n\nI don’t see why they’d say no to that just because they “don’t want me traveling alone.” That would honestly be hypocritical. My brother got to study abroad by himself in other countries when he was my age or even younger. I’m used to traveling. I’ve gone on cruises, long drives to other states, and flights to different countries, etc.\n\nI’m an adult now, and I feel like I should get that same trust and respect. I live on my own in college, I’m responsible, I do well, and that should prove something. Even though I just \"became\" an adult I've been mature and try to continue to prove that, as well as to his parents.\n\nBut his parents are also uncomfortable with the idea of us sleeping in the same room, and apparently so are mine, I think. I understand that part to an extent, because parents obviously don’t want to think about their kids having s\\*x. I get that. But his sister and her boyfriend are sharing a room on the cruise, and nobody blinks an eye because they’re older and live together. Like OK, but that still feels like a double standard to me.\n\nIt’s unfair that we’re not seen as “serious enough” just because we’re younger or haven’t been together for years. Like yes, time matters a lot in any type of relationship, but it’s not everything. To me, connection matters more, the way you communicate, support, and grow with each other.\n\nYou can be together for five years and still break up if there’s no connection. Time doesn’t guarantee anything. Even if it’s other things/variables that end the relationship, those things usually come from or relate to a lost or broken connection no matter how long you’ve dated.\n\nMe and my boyfriend have already been through rough patches and worked through them with maturity, honesty, and self-reflection. We communicate openly, we’re patient with each other, and we’re both emotionally intelligent people who genuinely love and support one another.\n\nIt’s not that blind first love “sunshine and roses” thing people assume. We’re actually serious and devoted. Like yes it all starts with that but it's how u move forward after that, which really shows how serious we are.\n\nBefore we even started dating, we talked every single day, all day, for months, went on dates, got to know each other deeply, and I didn’t rush into saying “I love you.” I even told him not to say it until it felt real. When I finally said yes to dating him, it was because I knew it was love, not infatuation or desperation.\n\nPersonally I don’t date just to date. I date to marry because I see long-term potential and shared values. I’d never date someone to just waste my time if I didn’t see a future or someone worth building a connection with. I knew exactly what I wanted going into a relationship, which is why I feel so very secure in it now.\n\nSo when parents or other people assume we’re too young to know what love is, or that our relationship won’t last, or that it’s too new, or only our first, it honestly hurts. It’s dismissive. It feels condescending.\n\nI know they care and want to protect us, but assuming things without really knowing us is unfair. If they have concerns, I just wish they’d communicate them clearly instead of shutting things down or saying no with no explanation.\n\nFor example, when my mom said, “this is a traditional household,” I asked what that actually meant, and she didn’t explain. I was just met with repeated nos when asking why we weren’t allowed to sleep in the same room.\n\nI respect traditions, but not everything fits into one specific box, especially since we’re not a “traditional” couple. We’re legit two men!!! I’ve slept in the same bed with my girl friends during sleepovers and trips before and it was fine because there was nothing to worry about, again that \"traditional\" aspect out the window. The only difference now is that my boyfriend and I are dating, but that doesn’t automatically mean we’re crossing boundaries.\n\nWe’re adults. Even if we did choose to be intimate, that’s our business. It’s not something parents should try to completely control at this stage.\n\nIf they’re worried about safety or being responsible with intimacy, wouldn’t they rather trust us to make smart choices than just assume we can’t? I think it’s way more respectful to communicate and set boundaries together instead of just saying no to everything.\n\nHis parents did communicate that they don’t want to think about their child having s\\*x, especially not in their house. I can understand and respect that boundary. But when it’s outside their home, and we’re both adults, we deserve more trust and respect.\n\nIntimacy is bound to happen sooner or later, and our parents know that and have said they are well aware of it. Wouldn’t they rather it be with someone trustworthy and safe(plus we can't get pregnant or STDs so most intimacy concerns aren't applicable as they are in straight couples, like our older siblings), rather than sleeping around with a bunch of random people like most assume, young adults our age do. We’re responsible, and if I were a parent, I’d honestly be more comfortable with my son/daughter being with someone they trust and are dating. But since I’m not a parent, I wouldn't know, which is why I think open communication with my parents is so important.\n\nIf the concern is that our families don’t know each other well enough yet, that’s something we’re trying to fix. We actually want to get closer with both sides. While my boyfriend is pretty outgoing and great with small talk, I have to really step up and try harder because I tend to be more shy and reserved.\n\nWe’re both open to spending more time at family gatherings, celebrating holidays together without intruding, and showing that we take this seriously. My brother and his wife used to alternate holidays between their families when they were still dating, and they still do now. I always thought that was such a great balance. That’s what I want for us too someday.\n\nWe also had an idea and started this NYC trip we’re planning for December break, which is another example. We’re doing everything maturely. We made a full extensive itinerary, detailed checklist, and strong financial plan. We’re taking everything into account, including our families’ schedules, possible concerns, travel, backup dates, and being super responsible about it.\n\nWe’re doing that not just for us, but to show both our parents that we can handle things on our own.\n\nBecause at the end of the day, the whole point of a relationship is that you grow into family. Before my brother’s wife married into our family, she was already treated like family, invited to everything, respected, and trusted. I think me and my boyfriend deserve that same chance.\n\nWe can’t just be expected to wait forever, like until we’re in our 30s(like our siblings), to be given that respect or trust. That’s controlling, and time shouldn’t be the only thing that proves we’re serious. I feel like effort and devotion speak louder.\n\nWe’re already putting in the effort now, trying to show we’re serious through both words and actions. If parents want to see proof, we’re genuinely ready to give it. But they also need to be open to actually hearing us out instead of assuming they already know what’s best. I get that this comes from love and concern, but love also means trusting your kids to grow up and make their own choices, even if they mess up sometimes. That’s how we all learn. You can’t keep your kids in a protective bubble forever.\n\nMe and my boyfriend just want the chance to prove that, the same way our siblings did. And yes, we may be 18 and have only dated for a little over 3 months, and we’ve known each other for a little over 6 months, but people are bound to dismiss everything I just said and claim, “Sorry to break it to you, but it’s your first love and it isn’t real,” or “Not enough time has passed,” or “This is just the honeymoon phase.” We’ve been told those things so many times, and it hasn’t changed a thing about how we feel about each other and what we believe in.\n\nBecause from what I take away from that, it’s unrealistically controlling and unfair. At least our parents should hear us out with words and actions. To me, it feels like we’re doing everything right, just not being seen or understood for it yet.\n\n  \n",

      "selftext": "I’ve been with my fiance for almost four years. He’s 29, I’m 27. We’re engaged and are supposed to get married next June.\n\nHe’s a recovering heroin addict. He’s been clean for almost six years, or so I thought.\n\nWhen we met, he told me everything. About the OD that nearly killed him. About the friends he lost. About his time in a halfway house. He was honest and self-aware in a way that most people I’d met up to that point weren’t and I fell hard for him. I don’t think I was naive. I knew it was a big deal. I did actually take some time to think about whether I should continue the relationship. I felt nervous about it at first but that faded with time. He seemed like someone who’d done the work and wanted nothing to do with that life anymore.\n\nAnybody who met him would be shocked to know about his past. He held down a job, reconnected with his family, even started leading meetings for newer guys in recovery. We moved in together last year. Got a dog. Picked a venue for the wedding. Built a life that felt solid. But over the last few months, something shifted. It started subtly. He’d sleep through his alarm. Miss his meetings. Get irritable over little things, then apologize and say he was just tired. I noticed he was losing weight. His moods got weird. His pupils looked off sometimes. But I brushed it aside. Told myself it was stress. His job put a lot of pressure on him and he started to hate it and at first I thought he was just depressed. \n\nUntil one night, I came home and he was just… gone. No note, no text. His phone went to voicemail. He showed up five hours later, said he’d gone for a drive to “clear his head.” When I asked why he didn’t tell me, he flipped and said I was being controlling.\n\nI asked him point blank if he was using again. He looked me dead in the eyes and swore on everything that he wasn’t. \n\nI can’t explain why, but I didn’t believe him.\nI wanted to, but his voice and the way he rushed his words and fidgeted his hands, idk, it just didn’t feel like him. It felt like a version of him I’ve only heard about in stories. The one who lied to everyone. The one who disappeared for days.\n\nSince then, it’s been a downward spiral. He keeps saying I’m overreacting. That I’m projecting my “anxiety” onto him. That I’ve turned into a cop, not a partner.\n\nAnd maybe he’s right. I check his eyes. I sniff his laundry. I stare at his phone when he’s not looking. I’ve searched all over the house and his car for anything he’s hidden. I’ve turned into this paranoid shell of a person, trying to piece together a puzzle I don’t even know exists.\n\nIt’s just a gut feeling I can’t shake. And every time I ask again, he gets colder. Like I’m pushing him away just by asking the question. So now I’m stuck. I don’t know if I’m just losing my mind or if I’m right to not believe him.  ",

I've noticed some guys bring tripod stands and record themselves working out for posting on social media. Initially this didn't bother me much. But today after doing my bench press when I was walking to the other side of the gym to catch my breath, suddenly someone started yelling at me. When I turned back, I saw a guy yelling that I had disturbed his video while he was recording his squats which he'd post on Instagram. I got furious and said that he must keep someone beside the phone and alert anyone coming in the path. What I can't comprehend is that gym is a place to workout right. Then why do these guys think it is their privilege to disturb others for creating videos?",

      "title": "I wish I never dated my ex.",
      "selftext": "My ex and I broke up a couple years ago. She talked shit about me in front of friends more than once. Most notably was telling a friend's gf that I said to her \"why can't you have a body like that?\" Talking about the friend's gf. For clarification she wore a bunny suit and I jokingly said something to my ex about how she should wear one too. \n\nShe sends videos from the camera we had in the house around that's conviently cut to make me look like the bad guy. We'd be in a screaming match and it would be videos of me screaming that were hard to watch but she leaves out the instigating from her, leaving out me trying to walk away and she's still pushing me. There's one where I slap it off the wall and she sent that around to show how abusive I am. But didn't tell anyone that I had just found out that months before that she had gotten my little sister high who was like 15 at the time. In our apartment. Making my mom feel like my sister wasn't safe there. Betrayed my trust and the trust of my family. But I'm the bad guy cause I bitch slapped the camera. \n\nWe got together senior year of highschool and were together for about 3-4 years or so. In highschool I had low self esteem and still do. I have a hard time talking to women but I'm a good looking guy. My mom and sisters always pointed out girls staring at me in public but I either didn't notice or if I did my low self esteem tells me they're making fun of me. Apparently though in high school (me and her were friends since freshmen year) girls would approach her asking about me and she would sabotage it. They'd ask her if he and her were together and she say yes. Most notably is one girl I liked sophomore year approached her and said she liked me. Her response was \"NO!\" In a condescending and smug tone. I can't imagine how embarrassing that must've been for the girl. And I was heartbroken at that time cause of another girl and it would've been helpful to talk with another girl. No apology for that from her though, said she wasn't sorry cause she got what she wanted. \n\nShe's manipulative. She sent screenshots of a conversation with my brother she had about him using her shampoo. She sent a message cussing him out. Then before he could reply she sent a much more rational \"hey I don't know if it was you but please don't use my shampoo.\" And then when my brother replied in a rude way she screenshot it without her original message and sent that around to make him look bad and like he's abusive to her. \n\nMe and her still keep in contact cause we have a dog together that she keeps but sends me pictures of. I updated her on me becoming a volunteer firefighter. She said I was \"incredibly stupid\" for doing something dangerous without getting paid for it. Then I said she was an idiot for saying something like that. Her reply was \"I'm not gonna let you call me names \" as if she didn't just call me \"incredibly stupid.\" \n\nShe's always so negative, even when we were together. She's manipulative. She's selfish. She wouldn't even drive my step dad to the store so he could get allergy medication, because of my cats, after he just helped drive eight hours to mine and hers new apartment. She's pessimistic, she made me feel trapped with the \"if you break up with me I'm gonna kill myself.\" \n\nMost of this stuff I didn't even find out for months after the breakup. I'm pissed I didn't see it before, I hate the person I became with her. I have anger issues, and all the stuff I learned to deal with in the moment didn't work with her. I learned to walk away when I'm angry and cool down, that didn't work because she'd follow me. She's right that I'm incredibly stupid because I didn't see how awful she is. All the good memories are tainted, and none of them are worth how I feel now. She's the only real gf I've ever had, she's the only person I've been intimate with and every time I talk to someone now and it doesn't pan out I think about how she said \"no one else would ever put up with me.\" I wish I could erase it all. \n\nI think she brought out the worst in me. I really hope that was the worst in me. I don't even know if I want another relationship at this point because I feel so much calmer now. I'm not angry all the time anymore. There's not someone blaming me for everything. There's no one trying to make me look like the bad guy. It's been two years though since the breakup and I don't want to get stuck loving the solitude so much that I never try again. \n\nFelt good to type this out instead of saying it over and over again in my head.

      "selftext": "This is my first Reddit post. It feels wild sharing this online but I don’t feel comfortable talking to my friends or family about it. I’m at a loss right now and truly do not know how to feel \n\nMy husband (28M) and I (28F) have been married for almost two years. Lately, it feels like we’ve been fighting about everything both big and small. \n\nA few days ago during an argument, I told him (for the first time) that it felt like he hated me. He immediately apologized, comforted me, and said that wasn’t true. He assured me that he loved me and never wanted me to feel that way.\n\nLater that same night, we went over to our neighbors house to watch the UFC fights. We both had a few drinks while we were there, nothing crazy though. When we had got home, we started being intimate. We’ve always had a playful and good dynamic in that area, and we’re comfortable with each other.\n\nWe both enjoyed some dirty talk with each other and had been doing it for years. But this time, something felt different. In the middle of us having sex, he leaned in close and whispered in my ear, “I hate you.” I froze, thinking surely I must have misheard him. But then he said doubled down and said it again.\n\nI immediately told him to stop. I don’t even think he realized I was serious until I yelled at him to get off of me. I was completely shock and couldn’t even find the words to say to him in that moment, so I just ended up sleeping in the guest room that night.\n\nThe next morning, we had plans to go to Costco. The car ride was silent and tense until I finally brought it up. I told him how weird and hurtful it was that he said that to me. He brushed it off, saying that he was just drunk, that he didn’t mean it, and that I t was just part of “dirty talk”. He convinced me that I was overreacting.\n\nBut this wasn’t the same as what we’ve done before, not even close. Especially because earlier that very day, I told him it felt like he hated me. And then he said those exact words during one of our most vulnerable moments.\n\nBy the time we pulled into the Costco parking lot, I was crying. I told him I wasn’t going inside and just sat in the car, trying to process what had happened.\n\nI don’t know if I’m overreacting, but I can’t shake how wrong this feels. I keep replaying it in my head and just feel embarrassed and ashamed. The whole situation is so bizarre it doesn’t even feel real.",

She’s drinking a lot, apparently she started her old habit of cutting herself again, and she is always talking about him and how she wishes she could hate him but can’t. She still cares about him.\n\nA month or so ago she was super sloshed and I managed to weasel some info out of her and found him here on Reddit. I messaged him on her behalf, saying that she deserved an apology from him (he never answered, the loser) and when I told her I did that, she was happy I stood up for her, but also really upset that I even said anything to him, because she didn’t want him to think she was sending people after him (apparently there’s been a few other friends of hers who have done similar things).\n\nSo yesterday she was drinking again (and cut again as well) and started talking about him again and I just could not listen to another word about that piece of shit, so I lied and told her that recently he had responded to me, saying that he wished she would just kill herself and that he hated her. She seemed shocked and didn’t really seem to know what to say, but then she got really mad and was angry that I ever talked to him in the first place. Then she stopped talking to me.\n\nTo be honest, I’m glad I did it. Even if it costs me her trust or her friendship, I’m glad I did it, because I’m hoping this is what will make her finally hate him and move on from him. I know she cares for him still, but I’m 100000% percent sure that this cheating fuckface doesn’t give a rats ass about her at all. She NEEDS to move on from him, and if it takes her thinking that he wishes she’d die and that he hates her for that to happen, then that’s that. I just want her to get better.",

      "selftext": "I haven't felt that miserable and confused in forever. I'm pretty successful 40f privileged in every single way you could think of. Nice corporate career and a rather nice marriage, living in a country I like, surrounded by friends, you name it. I'm rather good-looking, never had big problems with establishing connections with people, some health problems but nothing too bad. I've always considered myself very psychologically stable, self-confident, very far from fragile… you know, everything under control. Until 2025 happened and smashed it all into some bloody radioactive dust, and I don't know what to do with myself anymore. \n\nI was headhunted to my current country of residence some time ago. It's not Western and somewhat close to where I'm from culturally. I like it here, we settled down pretty well, I have local friends and consider it home now. In January I’ve got a new manager who is also an expat but from the West. We got along somewhat okay from the very beginning, even though it became very obvious to me that we're very, very different ethically. He is your typical arrogant charismatic asshole in his 50s, on a pretty high position in the company, rather questionable expertise IMO, extremely unkind to people, especially locals. He kinda saw me as someone who would share this attitude towards local life and people at first, I made it clear it's not the case. He was sharing some personal stories, they mostly made me cringe (like leaving his “old” wife for a very young local girl and bitching about ex personality, alimony and their kids, this kind of stuff). Cringe to no end, if you ask me, but hey, not my monkeys, or so I thought. Sometimes he's unexpectedly human and vulnerable, and I kinda think that maybe he's more than just a corporate asshole, after all, but it's some 10% of time maybe. \n\nWhat was a bit more complicated to handle was his professional opinion on me and my area of expertise and him not delivering pretty much anything while ruining the communication lines with anyone in the company by being an arrogant asshole he is. All in all, it's pretty obvious, I guess, that the guy is not my type in any way on earth. I started quietly looking around but our area is rather niche, and it was either leaving the country or waiting for a nice opportunity to show.\n\nAnd then one day I wake up, and this asshole guy is a light of my life pretty much. Saying I was confused feeling this way is a bloody understatement. I don't mess with people like that. I'm too old for this shit and I know better. He makes me sick to my stomach with his cringe stories and attitudes, he's the opposite of my type even visually, there's literally nothing about him I like. I mean, okay, he's somewhat smart and knows how to be funny but almost always in a very unkind way. And yet here we are: I have this insane and confusing dependency on him now which feels like a physical illness rather than anything romantic TBH. \n\nEverything in my life went out of the window more or less. I've lost whatever personality I had before. All I do is crying and talking to him in my head, playing over different situations again and again, trying to make his reactions and attitudes make any sense other than being the unkind and uncaring impulses they probably were. I'm overthinking everything to no end. I'm so mad at myself for all that. I don't understand the nature of this attraction, I would never come a single step closer than absolutely necessary to a person like this. I'm somewhat contained at work (or so I think) but when I switch off the camera, I'm a bloody mess. \n\nHe sensed that, I think, and started telling me stories about all the women who have been attracted to him and how he's oh so irresistible. More cringe, yay. Now I'm a yet another head on his imaginary trophy wall. More and more work gets dropped on me without any comments or thank yous. No credit, him attributing my projects to just himself in front of me. I never comment, confess, confirm or anything because I'm too busy dealing with myself and crying, and also I'm not that crazy, not yet. But he knows oh so well how to balance that with some warmth and vulnerability, and that keeps me on the hook. Intermittent reinforcement, I know. I know it all. \n\nAnd that's when a shiny new job opportunity arrives. I get interviewed, jump all the hoops, they're so excited they offer me a salary higher than the initial job grade one and can't wait to get me. The company is international this time, much bigger and much better to work at than our current one, the top-1 employer in the region with way more career perspectives. The manager lady seems lovely. There are a couple of ex-colleagues working there who recommended me and can't wait to have me as well. All rainbows and unicorns, you know. \n\nThe deadline for the answer is tomorrow. They have contacted me twice already to make sure I'm still considering them (I guess, I'm not bad at what I do, huh). But I've been crying almost non-stop for a week by now and being unable to think straight. I'm seriously considering dropping it. I know, I shouldn't. I would never be able to explain this decision to anyone in the world because no one knows about this stupid, humiliating attraction thing I would also never be able to explain to a single living person who knows me. \n\nMy biggest luck in this whole situation, I guess, is that he has never wanted me for himself. Something to thank the universe for for the rest of my life because it would be one of those perfectly ridiculous stories when you ruin your whole life and personality just to discover yourself being smashed to dust a couple of years later, if at all. But even now, when we've never had any more of relationship than a work meeting, I almost can't make myself accept the offer and leave. It's ridiculous. It feels more and more ridiculous as I'm typing it now. But that's how I feel. \n\nI don't know what to do and how to survive all of that. More crying, I guess, but then what. My cultural narratives tell me to stay and support him in everything as much as it gets (somewhat old-school, I know, and not perfectly Western). My analytical side tells me it's some stupid psychiatric phenomenon or something, that I’m burned out and spiraling, and cutting the exposure should help. Focusing on myself and things under my control, touching the grass and caring for myself, you know. Then again, I'm normally pretty vain and career-oriented, so this new job would probably help to rebuild my self-esteem a bit also. I just need to press the Accept button and then tell him in his face tomorrow that I'm leaving. \n\nHe won't be mad or anything. He will make this most vulnerable face and say he understands and wishes me luck. And how I've been doing so much and it will be tough without me. And it feels like it will kill me on the spot.\n\nFun stuff, huh. One day you're all successful and in control, and the next day you're a ruin with no will and no direction anymore for no real reason even. Just a crying nonsense of a human being not even able to explain what this whole crying is about. ",

      "selftext": "I don't think romantic relationships are worth it. Now, hold on folks, don't raise your pitchforks at me: let me explain. I remember at the start of High School, I was a \"different\" kid. Now I know you're probably thinking it's gonna be another one of those posts saying \"Oooh, I was different as a kid! I was special! I'm not like the others!\" But I swear it's not. Hear me out.\n\nYou see, as a child, I remember, well, yeah, as I said, being \"different\", but not in the way that most people would define that. I think the culture at that time had caused many teenagers to default to a certain set of viewpoints. Of course, this was not always true, but I noticed it being increasingly common. I was the polar opposite of these viewpoints. And I'm not saying there's not others who were my age who believed in it too, I am not that ignorant, but I didn't know anyone else who didn't, so it was just me.\n\nAnyway, one of these so called viewpoints is being desperate to get a girl or boy friend. Now, I know this is obviously not caused by simply the culture at that time: Adolescent's developing hormones can make a lust for romantic activity come naturally. However, I think since this so called \"culture\" was made up mostly of teens, this was normalised. Not that that's a bad thing.\n\nNow here's where I come in. I was completely disinterested in this. I remember thinking about a sort of hierachy of love, similar to what the greeks presented. The highest, agape - a familial, unconditional love - I believed in, of course. But any other - except friend love - I thought was rubbish. I can see now that I've matured that is not true, however the actual view itself has stayed with me, causing me to be a bit repulsed by the idea of getting a girlfriend.\n\nIn conclusion, the idea stems from my childhood and how I was disinterested in romantic love then from an extreme point of view, unlike my peers.",

We met through a dating app and went out once on a coffee date. We had a few things in common such as our science background, we both liked to watch football so the conversation felt really easy. After that, we chatted on Telegram for a bit. We had initially made dinner plans the next day but due to some family matters i had, i cancelled and when trying to make new plans, it just didn’t work out because he was leaving soon. I also fell sick the day of his flight and didn’t manage to text him. When he left, he deleted Telegram and just like that, our connection disappeared. We never exchanged numbers, and I didn’t think it would matter until I realized how much I missed talking to him.\n\nAll I know about him is that he’s from Winnipeg, he’s REALLY tall, in his mid-20s, just recently graduated from college with a biological science degree. I do know his name but for privacy reasons, i will not reveal that. He was really kind and thoughtful and I’ve been blaming myself for not finding another way to stay in touch. I honestly feel we could have been great friends.\n\nI’m hoping by posting this the internet can work its magic or if by some miracle he sees this or if anyone recognizes who I might be talking about, please reach out or tell him I’m trying to find him. ❤️",

It feels like no matter how much I try, life just doesn’t open up for me.\n\nI’m 28, and I always thought by now I’d be doing something meaningful, earning at least a little, feeling settled in some way.

Like maybe I’m one of those people who never gets lucky.\n\nAnd it doesn’t help when I look in the mirror. I have acne marks, and I don’t feel beautiful. It’s like life just handed me the short end of every stick; looks, luck, opportunities. I feel like I’m destined to struggle while others keep moving forward effortlessly.\n\nI don’t wish anyone harm, I just wish I knew how to stop feeling this way, how to not drown in jealousy and hopelessness.

      "title": "Worried Im Transitioning for the Wrong Reasons",
      "selftext": "So for a little background, I'm 18 right now, high school senior. I've known I liked men basically exclusively for as long as I've had any sort of feelings towards anyone, and I've never been very shy about that fact. Around 15 or 16 I started having really awful awful feelings about actually going through puberty, I mean it was obvio to me that I wanted to transition eventually but I kinda pushed it down for a while.\n\nAlso around that time I really only had 1 close friend, and we did like everything together. He is straight and always made that clear but to be honest I held out hope for a while anyways. About a year and a half ago I confessed to him that I had really strong feelings for him, and he handled it very gracefully (of course he did, he is just like that) but shot me down. We remained friends for a while but the rejection really fucked me up. I had never actually had any romantic or sexual experiences so I had kinda wrapped my gay identity up with the hypothetical relationship in my head I had with my best friend, and it all came crashing down when that was shattered. I had a really bad phase of about 8 months where I tried to convince myself and other people I was straight and tried to act really macho, I even roped a poor girl into being my girlfriend and was not good to her or for her, I wasn't even attracted to her I just tried to convince myself I was.\n\nEither way after this phase died down I did some self-reflecting, I had some good conversations with my psychologist lady, she encouraged me to stop pushing down the trans feelings and eventually I decided I'd try horomones for a bit and see how I felt on them since I'm not having biological kids anyways. I had to wait until I actually turned 18 because of my states laws but about two months ago I finally got on hormones and t blockers. A month in and changes were slow but I really did feel way way way better on the horomones, emotionally and physically, even if I was still publicly closeted about that part of me and not sure if I was even going to ever publicly transition. I confessed to my bestfriend about what I was doing and this is where things get slightly curveballed.\n\nBasically he was really supportive and just offered to be there, typical stuff, but he treated me a lot different. There were a lot of questions which honestly felt good because it was nice to know he cared, but some of it got very personal, asking what my body would look like if I kept doing the hormones, if I still liked men, etc. I mean I know thats not super out of the ordinary but the way he asked it I felt something was up. Then he started making a lot of comments, about how I'm going to be a really good girlfriend and wife someday, how he can tell how cute I'm going to look, saying I already look cute (I don't, I'm still very early on estrogen and dont look very different really), even stuff like sending me a list of names he thinks are cute and encouraging me to take one of them, and a week ago he bought me a dress (which isn't something I had ever worn before, I mean I was always openly effeminate but I still would just wear sweatpants or pajamas and baggy shirts), and encouraged me to try it on and send him pictures, which I did, and he kept talking about how cute I looked in it and said I should wear makeup and stuff like that more often (he even said something about wear it \"for him\" at one point but unsent the message on imessage). He's not a physical guy but he's touched my face a few times to see \"how soft my skin is getting\" which is more contact than either of us have done in the past, we're both usually contact averse.\n\nI'm not stupid, at least I think, I can tell hes trying to flirt with me a little, that or I'm super delusional. I'm just getting worried because, at the end of the day, this whole thing has really encouraged me to take the steps to make the full leap. I mean I was already sure I was going to stay on horomones forever, but wasn't sure about actually presenting as a girl. But now I really want to do it, and I'm preparing to come out to people in my life about it, but I'm worried I'm not doing it for the right reasons or that it's going to come back to bite me. I mean, truthfully, the only reason I was ever hesitant about going \"fulltime\" with it is because I dont come from an accepting community, but with him I see more benefits than I do drawbacks. But if he pulls back or things dont work out, I'm worried I'm wrapping up my identity in the idea of a relationship with him, and that if it falls through, it's going to crash down like it did earlier. I don't know, I think I'm better than I was then, but am I doing this for the wrong reason? In the back of my mind I had always wanted to be more confident and openly trans female, but I'm worried the lingering things about lack of acceptance that held me back were right, and that if I do this just because I'm being fed by my delusions that my friend will keep my safe or feel comfortable pursuing a public relationship with me if I was publicly out, I'm going to regret it. I would do anything to be in a relationship with this man and I just worry that \"anything\" in this case might socially isolate me from a lot of people. For what its worth my parents and sister are also supportive at the least.\n\nI dont know...",

I’m pregnant and exhausted, but no one seems to care.\n\nAt night I lie awake, talking to my baby, because it’s the only soul in this house that feels like mine.  \nSometimes my stepmom laughs and says, You should’ve tried harder to keep him, and my dad just sits there, silent.\n\nI don’t even know what hurts more  being abandoned by the man I loved, or realizing that my own family stopped seeing me as a person.",

      "selftext": "My brother (25M) has never really dated before. He always been quiet and introverted. He just works, comes home, goes to gym, and plays one or two games if he isnt too tired. Most of his early 20s were spent helping out our family and working long hours. He didn’t go out, didn’t date, didn’t have much of a social life as far as i know.\n\nHe also never did much around the house, but not because he was lazy. He was always exhausted. My mom and I handled his laundry and meals because we knew how much he was doing for everyone else. It just became routine.\n\nLast September, he finally moved out. Because our sister was able to get scholarship, he can now afford to get his place. He found a small apartment closer to his job because he hates driving and traffic.\n\nThen he met her. She’s 38.\nAt first, she seemed good for him. She’s got a stable job, she’s responsible, and she really takes care of him. She cooks, makes sure he eats healthy, keeps his place tidy when she comes over and she’s affectionate. Honestly, he looks healthier since they got together.\n\nWhat \"feels\" wrong is he moved in with him after just six months of dating. No big talk, no planning  she just started spending the night more and more until she never left. Now they live together full-time.\n\nMy mom’s clearly uncomfortable. She’s polite when the woman’s around, but I can tell it bothers her especially since the woman is only six years younger than her. Mom said she’s not going to intervene, though. “It’s his first girlfriend,” she told me. “He’s an adult. Let him figure it out.”\n\nShe goes through his phone all the time not secretly, just openly. She even knows his password of EVERYTHING. The first time I saw it while i was staying over at his place, she said, “Can I check your calls and texts real quick?”\n\nHe just let her. Didn't ask why. Didn't even care. Just \"Sure\".\n\nThings i thought was weird :\n\nShe shows up in his office randomly \"Just to see him\"\nAlways goes to gym with him eventho she doesnt exercise herself.\nHas access to all of his social media and blocks and unfollows people without asking.\nAlways location sharing.\nEven checks his steam account for some reason.\nCompletely manages his wardrobe and finance.\nAsks about every single woman in his office from his pictures\nOnce went looking for us while we were having coffee. Said \"Just wanted to make sure\"\n\n\nMy brother doesn’t see any of this as a problem. He laughs about it. Says things like, “That’s just how she is\". He told me once, \"Its's actually nice for him to not worry about anything”\n\nMy sister, though, is worried. She thinks the woman is too controlling and that my brother doesn’t realize how fast everything’s moving. She said it feels like he’s being swallowed by this relationship without even noticing.\n\nI honestly don’t know what to think. He seems happy and maybe that’s all that matters. But recently he said she has been talking about marriage. It has barely been year since they met.\n\nI just don't know if i should say something.\n",

      "selftext": "My brother sexually abused me when I was a teenager (He was in his twenties at that point). It took me two years to accept it and tell my parents. They sat us down together and basically told me that they hoped I could forgive him in the future, they asked me vaguely if I wanted him to leave home, but I was so nervous and scared that i told them no. \n\nHe and I didn't speak for months, eventually having to start again because the rest of the family didn't know anything, so I ended up creating a slightly peaceful coexistence with him out of obligation. He and I haven't touched each other physically since that day, neither of us enters the other's room, and we're generally not alone for long unless it's a public space and there are cameras. And it was horrible, but I guess you just get used to it.\n\nNow we're out of home (he still live with us) and we came to a small house with two rooms. One of the rooms has two beds. I was super anxious because I thought we'd have to sleep in the same room, but my mom is making him sleep on the couch. I don't know why I feel guilty and bad for him, but I can't help it, I hate it so much. I want to go back in time and punch my past self for agreeing to come on this stupid trip.\n\nI really want to cry. I want to be home and hug my dog. It makes me feel sick to feel bad about something so stupid knowing that he abused me, I feel like I'm invalidating what happened to me myself. I hate it. ",

I was just at nerf club and we were playing mafia (among us kind of) and I was told how it is kind of scary how good I am at convincing people that I am not the mafia when I am. Someone made a comment about how it’s scary how convincing I am (I used to do acting) (I swear this is all relevant). I commented that I get that a lot. I then said that it normally stems from the fact that my looks do not match my vibe. I have been told I have an honest face, a more dark humor personality (this was a while ago so it doesn’t apply as much any more). Anyway then one girl commented well is probably because your pretty and people don’t except pretty people to be nice or nerdy. I said thank you but I’ve been in shock all night.\n\nI have never been called pretty before, and in middle school I was made fun of a lot. One guy even compared me to another girl and said “she is hot and you are not”. I guess o have never thought of myself as pretty. I have always been an outsider due to my nerdier side but now I’m confused. I guess it’s making me question how I see myself. To me what messes with me is that there was no compliment fishing, or any prodding in that direction and she said it so plainly like it was an easily observable fact. I am happy that she thought that, but now I’m just wondering if maybe my insecurities are just unfounded. I guess I have never had anyone compliment me on anything other than my thin frame or my hair, but I’ve never been called pretty. I’m just reevaluating a lot of things and it feels nice to just lay it out. ",

I’ve been trying to reach out, and I stay on campus longer than I need to. My classes end at different times depending on the day, and I usually stay until 7:30 just to try to engage with people. But it’s daunting because in public, I can’t speak or act the way I want. I feel much more comfortable connecting over text or phone calls.\n\nI know I’ll be miserable until I find a genuine relationship. I’m the type of person who needs someone to tell about my days, to make playlists for, to surprise with fresh-baked cookies, to go to the park and goof around with, to have unprompted dance parties with. That kind of connection makes me feel whole.\n\nPlease believe me when I say I am trying to grow as a person outside of a relationship. I’ve made leaps and bounds, but I’m still scared.\n\nThere's so much more I I want to say but I don't want make a word salad and cry so anybody who has read this thank you.",

      "selftext": "I’m not really looking for advice. I just need to get this out. It’s been months since I found out, and even though I’ve been trying to heal and focus on myself, the pain still lingers. Maybe writing it down will help me breathe a little.\n\nI won’t get into too many details in case someone recognizes me, but… I’m in my 30s, so is my husband. We’ve been together for eight years, married recently, even bought a house together.\n\nFor the longest time, I thought cheating was something that could never happen to us. I really believed he only had eyes for me, that we were solid.\n\nIn the early years, I struggled a lot with insecurity. I’d overthink things, check his phone, make small problems bigger than they were. But eventually, I learned that kind of behavior only destroys trust.\n\nSo I worked on myself: I stopped checking, stopped accusing, stopped feeding the fear.\n\nWhenever jealousy tried to creep in, I reminded myself: he loves you, you’re safe.\n\nAnd honestly, things were good for a while. Until recently.\n\nThere was this coworker. Someone I’d heard of before. Back then, she was in a long-term relationship, so I never thought twice about it. But when she broke up with her boyfriend, she started leaning on my husband a lot. She’d call him, tell him she needed someone to talk to, someone who understood.\n\nAnd I was fine with that. I didn’t want to be controlling or jealous. I wanted to be the “secure” wife, the one who trusts.\n\nSo when he told me he was texting her or meeting her for coffee, I didn’t freak out.\n\nI told myself, there was nothing to worry about. I even encouraged him to reach out to her as I had gone through something similar and I understood what she was going through.\n\nI even met her! She was friendly, loud, kind of flirtatious, but harmless. I honestly didn't perceive any interest from her for my husband. I though we were safe.\n\nThings changed, though, once I went out of town. I often go to visit my family who lives in another city close to ours, and my husband came with me whenever possible but he couldn't always come. My friends told me not to leave him alone for so much time, but I disregarded this. My husband, although not happy about the amount of time I left, was ok with this too. \n\nSo I'm there with my family. Everything's normal: he calls me everyday, sends memes, funny videos, text messages...But one day, I called him and he said he was having breakfast with her. Hours later, I called again and he was still with her. This time, at her place.\n\nThat’s when I felt it, what I had tried to ignore and appease could not be ignored anymore.\n\nStill, I pushed it down. I told myself I was being dramatic because when confronted by this, my husband made it seem like it was all innocent and I was the one making it look tainted. So, again, I went against my better judgement, and decided to leave it alone.\n\nWhen I finally came back home, he acted like everything was normal. He hugged me, kissed me, made love to me, like nothing had changed.\n\nBut a few days later, I overheard him on the phone with her.\n\nHis voice was soft, different, the kind you only use when you are just falling for someone. He had just finished talking with her when he took his phone, glanced at me guiltily and went to the back of our house to get the laundry. That's when I lost it. As soon as he came back, I asked for his phone and went straight to recent calls and, of course, it was her phone number.\n\nI confronted him, he denied it at first, then got angry at me because I was making a big scene.\n\nBut later, he admitted enough. He said he had feelings for her. That he didn’t feel the same about me anymore. But, and here’s the part that breaks me, he also said he didn’t want to lose me.\n\nThat she didn’t feel the same way about him. That everything is only from his side. I don’t know if that’s true.\n\nSo now we’re here. He says he wants to work on the marriage, but he still works with her, still sees her.\n\nHe says he can't stop these feelings he has for her despite the time they haven't seen each other. I made him lose contact, although he has admitted they have seen each other when I'm not present because \"she doesn't know what he feels for her\".\n\nAnd I feel like I’m fighting for something that’s already half gone.\n\nWe’re supposed to start couples therapy soon. It was my idea, not his. Some nights, I pray. Other nights, I just cry until I fall asleep. But the one thing I’m trying to hold onto is this: This wasn’t my fault.\n\nI gave him love, patience, trust, everything I could. If anyone failed, it wasn’t me.\n\nI don’t know if our marriage will survive. But I know I will.",

My last boyfriend got mad at me for not being lively enough at an event. I'm afraid nobody will want me when it's realized that I have such a hard time functioning in everyday life. ",

She has always struggled to put on weight, and when we met she was 5'6\" and around 100 lbs. She never really forced herself to eat healthy, but she also didn't actively avoid things that were unhealthy, she would mainly just listen to her body and eat what made her feel good. That kind of backfired over time because when she's stressed she doesn't eat anything more than a handful of crackers or berries. She was also living with her parents before we got married last year and they weren't particularly interested in helping with my wife's mental (or physical) health journey. \n\nSince moving in after the wedding, our life hasn't been all fun and games, she struggled to adjust after moving away from her parents for the first time, she left an agency job to start in private practice, we needed to get new cars after our cars were unreliable, we moved, I lost my job (got a new, better one though) and she is currently in recovery for her second surgery in the last 3 months for a congenital defect in her hips that was causing her a lot of arthritis-like pain. \n\nWe went to the mall today because some of her bras weren't fitting right. I convinced her to get measured and her band and cup size has increased which triggered me to ask the usually ill-advised question of how much she weighs now.\n\nShe's hovering around 132 lbs these days! Even with the stress in our lives lately, she feeling a lot more comfortable than she felt before and she's able to eat more full meals more often! I'm so proud of her for doing better! I of course told her, I just wanted more people to know because I'm so happy she's at a healthy weight for probably the first time since she was a kid!",

      "title": "She’s leaving me, and I still love her, but I’m just completely drained",
      "selftext": "English is not my first language so apologies if something doesn't sound right.\n\nMy girlfriend has been dealing with depression for a while now (under treatment with medication). She’s also been off work recently due to a motorcycle accident we had. I’ve tried to support her the best I can, financially, emotionally, practically. I've paid for food, helped with bills, supported her through panic attacks, and been there. I never did it to hold it over her head, I just wanted us to be okay.\n\nA few weeks ago, something happened that completely messed up things between us. The day before she was to come back work, we were coming back from a trip my dad, her, and I. When we got back to my city, she had a panic episode in the motorhome. She started crying, saying she couldn’t go back to work, that one of her coworkers (who treated most people poorly, and most just ignored her including me) triggered her depression badly, and she wanted to walk home alone. She got out of the motorhome and started walking off. My dad followed her, tried to stop her, grabbed her backpack. She resisted, pulling away. I got out of the motorhome when I heard her yelling, but I just stood there frozen. I didn’t know what to do.\n\nThen, my dad slapped her. Not violently, more like a “wake-up” kind of slap (like in movies when someone panics), but yes it was still a slap. Ever since that day, she’s called him abusive (it happens that her mom and sister used to psychologically abuse her back in her country, but says her mom is the only one that understands her and treats it as if it was a joke), and she says I let him hit her. She’s threatened to report him several times. She says I’m complicit for doing nothing.\n\nNow, almost three weeks later, she’s still bringing it up every time something happens. Today, she saw me in the street walking with my dad. I waved at her just raising my hand because I didn’t want to make things worse in there and we were in a rush. Later, we went out for a ride with our dog and e-scooters, but she was cold and angry the whole time.\n\nTonight, she messaged me again, furious that I “never defended” her, that my dad is abusive, and that she wants to leave me. I tried explaining everything I’ve done for her over time, not out of ego, just out of hurt, and she responded by listing all the material things she’s ever given me, as if our relationship is just a transaction and nothing else I did was worth.\n\nThen she told me she wants to return all my stuff, wants the e-scooter back, and doesn’t want anything to do with me anymore, and said she only loves the dog we got together. She blocked me, then unblocked me just to say she hates me, sent me a screenshot of a message to me saying that she felt controlled by my dad trying to influence her during our relationship, that she knows it was not my fault what he was doing, but that I was normalizing it (Ironically, she was the one who told my dad all her trauma stories one time they went to the airport to receive me after a flight, and whenever we would be all together eating outside. I never spoke to him about what was going on in our relationship, and he was just all the time trying to help her out of love for me). Then she blocked me again.\n\nI still love her. I really do. But I’m so emotionally exhausted that I feel empty. I’ve lost the energy to love anyone. I feel angry and just… tired. I just feel like crying, but can't even do that with all the rage inside me. As I always say, nobody said it would be easy or fair. But man do I hate how unfair I feel this situation is.\n\n  \nEdit: I went to her house to grab my things and she said I had to fix her laptop, gave her the scooters back and she asked me to get one to her house (2nd floor no elevator). I just told her I had an appointment with somebody and left.\n\nI can't keep this dynamic, where she wants me to leave but still asks for help. It's really hard and hurts a lot, but I just can't fight anymore.",

      "selftext": "I hate it. I hate myself because of it. All I want is to keep my friend safe, but I’m so tired. I don’t step in when guys approach her or buy her drinks - I know my place, lmao. I only step in when it’s clear (and i mean veeery clear) she isn’t interested and I’m also getting annoyed (cause come on i didnt come here for this). But I feel disgusted with myself for it, because I know all those dudes will talk about “the fridge” again. And I hate my friend for always flirting with the guys and then making me be the bad guy for having to tell them off. Like, why the fuck can’t you just say “fuck off” instead of hiding behind me? And before anyone says “oh, maybe the guys just didn’t get the hint” - I wouldn’t mind if that was the case. But when she’s laughing about the whole thing after putting it on me to maneuver us away from the guy (I never actually talk to them because I’m a bit scared - I just smile and shake my head or wave like “sorry, bye” and lead her away), it really gets on my nerves. The worst part is, I domt even think I look that bad. I mean not exactly a beauty standard type of girl but still. But every outing with her makes me hate myself a little more. I always take care of her, and I don’t really mind because she’s my friend and that’s how I treat my friends - but she doesn’t even care. One time I tried to talk to her about it, and she said she never asked me to take care of her. But like… what am I supposed to do? Just leave you on the floor when you inevitably trip again? I also feel responsible since her tolerance is so bad, but I don’t think I have the right to restrict her or tell her to drink less when she just wants to have fun. I just wished she could control herself a bit more (i dont wanna tell her that though cause thats a mean thing to say i think) Still, it always falls on me - to get her out the door (she usually ends up on the floor at least twice before that :))), to get us to the club (we usually walk because we’re broke students lol and sometimes it is a full on workou), to get through security, and all that jazz. In the club, I pick her up (when she falls over again or just randomly decides to lie down), bring her water, and never tell her she’s had enough drinks or make comments about her embarrassing herself (cause again i think thats just mean). I don’t stop her from talking to people - I just do my own thing and keep an eye on her (cause you never know) and in case she falls over again, which she always does when she’s drunk. And honestly, I don’t think I can keep doing this. It’s too much. It makes me feel like a horrible person, because maybe I’m trying too hard? Maybe this is normal and I’m just a despicable human being and a horrible friend for even getting annoyed about it.\n\nWow that was a long rant sorry about that\n\nTL;DR: I’m always the “responsible” friend who has to take care of my drunk, flirty friend on nights out. She hides behind me when guys bother her. I’m exhausted, starting to resent her, and hating myself for feeling that way.",

I don't feel normal. like there's something unnatural about me. I have a lot of anxiety about it. I can't tell anyone, it might just cause problems. Maybe I wish I could be blank, simple, untouched by all this noise that drags me into shame. Why can’t I just ***not*** want? Sometimes i wish i was a android. That way I don't have to worry about not being able to live life with all the experiences i desire. I wouldn't have to curse myself trying to please this split voice preaching purity and danger as the only paths in this area of life. There is in fact nothing outside of that, so why do i keep desiring something that doesn't exist. There is no right way to want. one would say just thinking of it is ruining myself, its disgusting. The uncomfortable ache that I keep feeling gets in the way of my thoughts or activities because I can't stop myself from thinking inappropriately. Thoughts this was a teenage thing. Impulsive confusion in my body. Why am I still broken? Other would say it's stupid to want to \"let yourself be used\". There is no real enjoyment or connection, just reducing yourself for no reward. Need to focus on yourself, your friends, your family... can they replace every aspect of life. Of course not. Not for me. Thats the problem. I'm broken. mentally unclean. Mentally a whore. mentally too weak.\n\nBe strong. not too much. You're too fragile. Stay this soft. There is no proper existence for me. Every part of myself is not good enough.\n\nWhy am i like this anyway? Why am I disgusting? I tried so hard to not think of those things ever, to be the best version of what i am supposed to be. Why did this get to me too? I didn’t ask for this part of myself. I didn’t ask to feel it. And yet it’s here, and I don’t know how to live with it without feeling like I’m becoming something I don’t respect. wish I could want without feeling like I’ve betrayed myself. But how do you tell the difference between desire and surrender, between softness and suppression, between closeness and being consumed?\n\nI might as well die if the only way to live is to isolate or accept assault.",

      "selftext": "Basically the title and it's been weighing on me for a while. \n\nLiterally no one ever took a second look or gave me a second thought. I had a close call once where the girl liked me, but not enough to want to be with me. \n\nAnd I get it, in highschool I was ugly and had a bad haircut and pimples and all, but I think I grew out of it now and look decent, even nice in some pictures. I still hate certain angles and I wouldn't say I am handsome or anything, but I am a lot better. \n\nPersonality wise, idk, I always stress about it. I always fear I have no personality at all and people find me annoying by default, but to be honest, in this moment of absolute truth, I don't think that's 100% true. I wouldn't say I am charming as in talking up people (cuz if I was this post would be very different lmao) but I don't think I am that dull either. \n\nThe thing is I feel so weird talking to a girl if I want something more with her, like ask her out or her number or something. Maybe it's some imposter syndrome, cuz the thing is that I don't have that problem when just befriending a girl and I have had a lot of girl friends (as in friends that were girls) over the years. Maybe I have convinced myself that no one will ever want something with me in this life and wired my brain to automatically assume rejection.\n\nI would (also) assume some people in the comments will be 'well, that's the problem' and I get it, I would probably say the same to a friend if they asked for advice, but it's really hard to not have that state of mind when you reach this age and literally no one ever seemed interested until now. When I don't pay it any mind and just go on with my life thinking 'if it is to happen, it will happen', nothing happens, if I start talking to someone, I get rejected. \n\nI mentioned earlier that I had a lot of girl friends over the years, I think I had more genuine friendships with girls than boys, but none of them were ever interested in me as more than that. Not that I expected them to, but come to think of it now, none of them ever really showed any interest for more and they kinda got to know me for real, when my heart wasn't beating at 200bpm cuz 'omg I am talking to a girl'. \n\nAnd at this point I don't even know if I can make it in a relationship. I haven't been in one, I obviously have some ideas of how it should be, but I still haven't actually been in one, maybe a girl who may be interested could be put off by this and don't even get me started on sex experience. I feel like at this point if a girl ever chooses me, for her it will feel like scraping the bottom of the barrel. \n\nAnd look, I know that there is a lot of negativity in this post and the thing goes 'love yourself first and stuff', but I've been working so hard on myself for the past few years, not for girls, but for myself because I wanted to. Someone once told me I have to 'be happy with my life first', but you know how happy I've been with my life for the past year? This all has been at the back of my head and I really enjoyed (almost) every day! \n\nSomeone else has said that it will happen when I 'will be ready for it'. What the hell do you want me to do, man? How come I am not ready now, at this age, but others are ready much earlier? I am not that dumb, nor that ignorant! What am I missing to be ready? \n\nIdk, I am not really looking for advice, just venting cuz I don't know what else to do. It's like a brick wall. \n\nI used to have this thing when I would wait for a bus and wait and wait and wait and it would be late and then I would pull put my phone and text someone, asking them what a guy gotta do for the bus to be on time. And then, without fail, the bus would finally show up one or 2 minutes later. To be fair, I am kinda trying the same thing now, maybe fate will take notice, as it did with the buses (I am just delusional, I totally talked to people about this before and here I am so...).\n\nI really don't want to be 30 and in this state because I don't want to feel for another 7 years (or more) how I feel now, but I'll be damned if I know what to do. ",

We’re both shocked,we would have never expected this from him, he’s a very educated,decent, polite and amable man who provides for us and shows us every day that he loves us. His relationship with my mother seems unchanged, they get along just as well as always. The only slightly unusual thing is that they sleep in separate rooms, but it’s been like that since my sister and I were little.\n\nI don’t know what to do. We’re a close, united family and have a good relationship with each other. My sister wants to tell our mother,but I don’t. I just hope this is a crazy episode that will pass, because I’m afraid that revealing this will tear our family apart and ruin our relationships. My mother would be absolutely devastated, she could never accept something like this. I’m so confused, I just want some advice on what I should do…",

At the time, my parents had separated, and I was vulnerable, so he became the only person I really felt close to. Over time, it turned into abuse.\n\nIt happened in multiple places, at his work sites (he works as a contractor), in unfinished houses, and during trips where we stayed in hotels. He’d always find ways to isolate me. Sometimes there were people sleeping nearby, which made it worse because I felt trapped and terrified. This went on for a long time, and eventually I just couldn’t take it anymore.\n\nI finally told my school, and they called the police. But the investigation was basically nothing. The cops only interviewed me (and briefly my sister), but they never spoke to my parents, never followed up on the places I told them about, never checked anything. Later, the prosecutor’s office told me: “it’s your word against his, we can’t do anything.” The case was dropped.\n\nYears later, I tried again. I went to the victim advocacy office with my case number, and they said nothing came up in their system. They said they’d look into it and gave me their numbers… then ghosted me.\n\nMeanwhile, the man who abused me was briefly arrested, made bail, and has lived freely ever since. He still lives in my neighborhood. Which fucks me up every time I see him, He has a big house, a successful business, and everyone praises him like he’s a great person. My parents believe me, but most of my family just said they “didn’t want to get involved” and left it in “God’s hands.”\n\nI’ve been in therapy for years. I was diagnosed with PTSD, Depression, and Anxiety directly connected to what happened. Therapy helps, but it get expensive at times I’m the one paying while he lives comfortably without consequences. Every day I see him across the street and it feel like torture, I hate this and feel like the system completely failed me.\n\nSo I don’t know what to do anymore. I just wish thing went different, I wish I could go back and do something about it, have something a photos or a recoding so there could be evidence. I know I’m not the only victim. Because he always was careful, by never saying anything on text only in calls, and in person.\n\nI don’t even know if it’s worth fighting anymore, but it eats away at me constantly.",

      "selftext": "I 26F am currently on a 6 day girls trip in Japan with two friends, one of them, Lily, I feel a bit closer to and like our vibes are more similar than my other friend, Sofia. \nFor a bit of context, we all work at the same company (different departments) and have only known each other for about two years. We're all around the same age, I've traveled the world throughout my life (mostly with family and/or boyfriend), so I've never experienced an extended trip with just friends. \nWhen the trip was in the planning stages, it seemed like it would be reasonably chill, some sightseeing, exploring cities, shopping, etc. But after 4 days I'm already burnt out. We're walking all day, which I don't mind, but it feels like we're always in a rush to go to the next activity, most of which are not interesting to me (which I know is me being picky and also a difference in personalities). \nSofia wanted to do a kimono rental for an afternoon and get the whole experience which sounded interesting and something I've never done before. Unfortunately, I did not realize how uncomfortable they are to wear and impossible to walk in. We walked through a forest so we could take pictures but for whatever reason, I was struggling to breathe and couldn't put more than one foot of distance in each step, my friends however said it was comfortable and were walking normally. Because they could walk just fine, I was playing keep up while in 80+ degree and humid weather. I'm glad they were having fun, and towards the end I said fuck it and went barefoot, and hiked half the kimono up so it was open at the side of my leg so I could catch up. Probably annoyed or confused some locals but at that point, I gave up and stopped caring. \nLater that same day, Sofia wanted us all to go a nightclub which I didn't realize our ticket entry time was 11pm. I was exhausted and after we came back to the hotel to get ready, I crash out on the couch and pretended to be asleep so they would leave without me. Which I also feel bad about. \nAt this point, I'm realizing just how introverted I am and have unfortunately gone non verbal because I'm so exhausted. I feel bad and probably shouldn't have come on this trip, I was just so excited to go back to Japan. ",

I’m already physically disabled and chronically ill so it’s incredibly difficult to leave the house. Some of you might suggest getting around by car which is a great idea until you consider the fact that I’m dealing with untreated motion sickness and my dad’s car, an SUV, makes me violently ill even from a 10 minute car ride. \n\nHow am I supposed to go to my medical appointments if I’m too disabled to go by public transit but the car makes me equally, if not more sick?? I don’t have a drivers license. I’m not sure if I trust myself to drive considering all of my health conditions (motion sickness + vertigo, ADHD, astigmatism). Most medications for motion sickness like Gravol makes me so groggy I’m physically unable to stay awake for the next 6 to 12 hours after taking a single dose. That’s not a life I want to live. How am I supposed to get better? ",

      "selftext": "Now, I know the title sounds awful, but just stick with me. I, L - 20 - have been in a half-year relationship with D - 22 (this coming Tuesday will be our seven month anniversary/monthaversary/whatever). Now, by any means, D is the best man I have ever been with through my years of dating - sweet, kind, funny, thoughtful, everything I could ever ask for...but sometimes there are times that I just don't feel important.\n\nFor example, D and I have been binging Demon Slayer so that we can watch the Infinity Castle movie together (whether in theaters or not, and he keeps reassuring me that we'll dress up regardless - I got us a couple's cosplay as Shinobu and Giyu), so I've been trying to get us through it as fast as possible because I'm really excited to see the movie and Demon Slayer is, hands down, one of my favorite anime that I have ever watched. It is also important to know that D and I are both gamers - he plays more shooters like COD and Delta Force while I mainly play story games like Life is Strange and God of War along with simulator games like Powerwash Sim and others - safe to say, gaming is important to both of us. D also loves to play games with his father and his friends, which is wonderful to see as someone who A - doesn't have a great relationship with my father and B - doesn't have a lot of friends - however, sometimes it feels like the plans we have are pushed aside so he can keep playing.\n\nTonight, I was hoping to get in a couple episodes before we go to bed and have to go to my house tomorrow to watch the Singapore Grand Prix (F1), something we always do since I inducted him into the sport, but he was playing Delta Force with his father. I said \"Cool, whatever, all good babes. Just let me know when you'll be done so I can stop playing my games.\" We communicated, agreed, and went about doing our own things - something I have never minded doing because we both often enjoy doing separate things while in the same room (autistic love languages and such). Anyway, I hear him say that his dad was tired so the round he was currently playing was going to be the final one, I nod and mentally catalogue it, get to a stopping point in my game before exiting and waiting for him. Fifteen minutes later, he turns to me and tells me that they had just gotten done playing the round but that he wanted to do one more round because he utterly destroyed his dad and his dad wanted revenge. I took a deep breath, sighed a little, but nodded and said it was no problem.\n\nI decide to flop on his bed and watch TikTok for a bit, knowing that that will make the time fly by and thus I can end it whenever I want to instead of getting into another game to just have to stop after a half hour or so. Then, another fifteen to twenty minutes later, D slowly turns around in his chair with a smirk on his face, catches my eyes \"Baaabbbeeess....you know how I said one more round?\" He drawled, this knowing look in his eyes that makes me sigh a little bit harder and essentially give up. This is not the first time this has happened - where one more becomes one more becomes five more becomes plans abandoned.\n\nUpdate:  \nOnce he had finished his match, he took me to Seasons to get snacks before going to Walmart to get legos and coloring supplies to do while watching the anime and we proceeded to stay up until midnight finishing the Entertainment District Arc. So it ended being a pretty good ending, but it still sucked prior to that.",

I even removed the Gemini logo in Photoshop. It looked like a legit photo of a real person in my room.\n\nI sent it. My friends bought it. A couple of them got genuinely concerned about what AI can do if I could fake something that perfect in minutes. Watching them react scared me a bit too.\n\nThen the weird part hit: after the laughs, I couldn’t get that picture out of my head. It felt like I’d manufactured a memory.

I’ve known them about three years but know her a lot better because we usually overlap in our workouts, but he’s usually there in the morning. \n\nI think we have a pretty good vibe and solid “buddy” chemistry so I don’t think it came across wrong. We were about something, and she made a reference to “pretty girls” like that word didn’t apply to her, and I just felt like I should say that it did. \n\nAnyhow, I’m hoping it doesn’t come back to haunt me. \n\nAdded context:\n\nShe said something about not being one of the “pretty girls,” which struck me as odd because a) she is pretty and b) she’s usually not self deprecating at all. She’s not arrogant either; she’s one of the most level, down to earth people I know. I asked why she said that, and she shrugged it off. My response was that for what is worth I think she’s pretty and i think most people I know would as well. Then we went on with whatever we were doing. \n\n\nIt’s just been nagging at me that maybe I said the wrong thing because it was a more personal comment. We’ve complimented each other before in relation to gym stuff, but this wasn’t that. We’ve also shared more personal moments (as supportive friends) just because when you see someone several times a week for a few years, you get to know them in a personal level and go through things like job layoffs, loss of loved ones, things like that. \n\n\nI’ve never once had any indication that their marriage was anything short of rock solid. They clearly adore each other and are very confident in their relationship. I’ve seen guys try to hit on her, and she doesn’t entertain them for a second. She’s listened to my relationship woes and either tried to cheer me up or laugh in my face or tell me I screwed up big time and need to go think about what I’ve done, whichever was appropriate. \n\n\nYes, I would consider myself lucky to be in a relationship with someone like her and one that’s as good as theirs is. But no, I do not have any romantic interest in her. \n\n\nI usually don’t overthink things like this, but for some reason it’s been bothering me. I don’t really know why. ",

I make sure not to throw away the ones he actually regularly uses, which is probably a rotation of 2-4 hats (he’s a Chicago sports fan, so he has his go-to Cubs/Bears/Bulls hats), but if I find any of the others, they go right in the trash followed by some dinner scraps to cover the evidence. Not that he takes out the garbage, though, so I’m not too worried about being found out.\n\nHe gets to waste money on hats he will never wear, and I get a clean(er) house. 😁",

I kept trying to be what everyone needed me to be  the good student, the good daughter, the understanding friend. I thought if I could keep everyone happy, maybe I’d finally feel like I belonged somewhere. But now I feel like I’ve built an entire version of myself just to survive, and I don’t recognize the person behind it.\n\nThere was a moment in my final year of school everyone around me was talking about their dreams and next steps. I stood there smiling and nodding, pretending to have it figured out. Inside, I felt completely disconnected, like I was watching someone else live my life.\n\nRelationships make it even more confusing. I give too much of myself and end up feeling invisible. I care deeply but start pretending again pretending not to care too much, pretending I’m fine when I’m falling apart inside. I don’t know when to stop giving or when to walk away.\n\nThe person I once liked showed me how lost I could get in someone else. We met when I was still in school and he was older, in college. We’d talk for hours, and I’d skip things just to stay connected. But when he got busy and started drifting away, I panicked. I started pulling back too, even though I missed him.\n\nThere was a cycle  him returning, me hoping, both of us misunderstanding each other. I’d overthink everything, block him, unblock him, and feel guilty for the things I said. I even lied once out of fear, and that lie still eats me up. I wasn’t trying to manipulate; I just didn’t want to feel like I was the only one who cared more.\n\nSeeing him move on later hurt, even though I told myself I had no right to feel that way. I realized then how deeply insecure I was how much of my identity I tied to being someone worth staying for. I didn’t know who I was outside of what other people thought of me.\n\nEven now, I’m still trying to figure out who I am. I want to stop pretending I’m fine, stop performing, and just be. I want to feel real again.\n\nI don’t know if anyone will understand, but I just needed to say this somewhere.\n\n",

The name of the channel was literally the very explicit URL included in the video.\n\nI reported it for \"Adult nudity\". 8 hours later: \"No violations found.\"\n\nTo be clear: my feed is pretty much an even mix of science content, funny animals videos, news, and stand-up comedy clips. Any kinda thirst-trap-type stuff gets immediately hit with \"Not interested\" (and that's very very rare as it is), and so the fact that the video showed up in my feed in the first place is worrying, and the fact that my feed is very explicitly non-explicit makes me worry for others, especially younger people, who might also come across this kinda content on their non-explicit feeds.\n\nIt just makes me so fucking annoyed that, like... it's literally adult nudity, and not \"tasteful\" or \"artistic\" or whatever, so why is there \"No violations found\"?! I get that it's somewhat automated but fucking do better for fuck's sake! And the fact that I can't then go to a human and say \"Hey, I think your system is fucked and this needs another look\" is just... yeah.",

      "title": "After 7 years, my ex got the karma he deserved",
      "selftext": "My hands are shaking as I type this, but I know this is something I have to let off my chest. \n\nI guess I’ll start from the beginning. When I (26F) was in college, I was 18 and just starting Freshman year. I got back in touch with my ex “Ben” (22M at the time) who was someone I knew from high school. We were good friends, so I thought we’d give it a shot and try dating. To put it simply, it was 8 months of trauma and hell. I was SA’d by him multiple times, specifically whenever he talked on the phone with his ex. When I asked him about his ex, he told me that he was just a friend and that I had nothing to worry about (years later, I found out that they broke up 4 months before we dated, so I was a rebound). Like an idiot, I believed him. At one point, my ex wanted me to be in an open relationship with him and his ex. I said no because I was monogamous and wasn’t comfortable with it. Even his ex, who I talked to over FaceTime once, wasn’t comfortable with it. Ben blew up at me and basically blamed me for not wanting to be in an open relationship with him so he could have his “two favorite people.” \n\nFast forward to July 2018, and Ben got into an accident. He was hit by a car and flew 15 feet into the air. He was okay luckily, just a black eye and some scrapes. It was at that point that I didn’t feel safe. The SA was worse and it got to the point where I was starting to question everything. I wanted out of the relationship and wasn’t sure how to go about it. I reached out to his ex and just vented about everything I was going through, minus the SA. The next day specifically before the 9 month mark, I broke up with him. He last words to me were, “I’m sorry I’m not good enough for you.” And he left. \n\nI broke down and cried because I was free from it, but at the same time, I wanted him to apologize for using me and the abuse. It got to the point where whenever I was overwhelmed, I’d feel his hands all over my body even though he was gone and had terrible nightmares. When Ben found out that his ex told me to break up with him, in his classic fashion, he blamed me for listening to him. I dodged a huge freaking bullet. I don’t know what I would have done if the relationship kept going. \n\nIn May 2022, I found out that Ben got into a relationship with someone else. I reached out to warn her about my experience and also asked if I could talk to him just so I could get things off my chest. And to my surprise, she agreed. I ripped into him about the sexual assault and using me. Ben didn’t say anything (I didn’t expect him to), but afterwards, his girlfriend told me I gave him anxiety. I told her I didn’t care and don’t come crying to me if something happens. He’s wearing his mask around her, but eventually it will slip. After that, I started therapy to heal from my trauma. \n\nNow fast forward to 2025, and Ben is now single. His ex left him for a person that she said was nothing to worry about, basically the same thing Ben told me back then and now she’s pregnant. It took years, but karma did her work. Ben is apparently a girl now and is a songwriter (though all of his (her) songs are AI and it’s painfully obvious) and is putting out diss tracks and trying to paint this narrative that they’re the only person in the world suffering. \n\nAs for me, I am now happily married and have moved across the country. It feels like the trauma bond I had towards Ben (or Autumn now) is finally gone and I feel absolutely nothing. \t",

      "selftext": "This is going to be a long one, sorry. \n\nI’m 25f. Just got married to my husband a few months ago. \nI have an almost 5 year old child. I love her so, so much, but back when I first found out I was pregnant (I was staying with my mom still and saving up money to go to college, move out, get a car, etc. Keep in mind I also helped with bills and stuff when I could.) our house burned down due to my father. He’s yet to see jail time due to this.\nOnce that happened, I immediately lost everything. My pets. My car. My money, everything… was gone in a flash. I was at work (40 mins away) and had to leave bc our neighbor called to tell us our house was burning. \n\nAnd I instantly knew: I did not want to go through with this pregnancy. I was already leaning towards an abortion but that really did it in for me… \n.. so I talked to my mom and told her what I wanted to do. I asked her for her help getting to the place I had to go to for an abortion.. I could get the money to pay for it myself, I just needed a way to get there. She was the only one with a car now and the only person I could lean on at that current time. \nAnd I feel like she failed me. \n\nshe said no. Went on a rant about how it’s murder, and how I’d be going to hell and would feel bad for the rest of my life if I did that. \nAgain. I had just lost everything. I was basically stuck. I cried for months after that, because by the time I found out, my state had just (again) came for abortion rights, and I was too far along for help after like a week and a half already. \n\nRed Cross put is in a hotel, I hated every second of it. Her father was present at this time, but he too over the months showed me this truly wasn’t going to work out so I left him. Didn’t keep the child from him or anything. He just stopped making any efforts in any regard about the child even after she got here. \n\nThat just made me even more hurt about basically being forced to have this baby that I did not want to birth. \n\nToughest thing ive ever had to do. Was raise a child in those conditions . I was still helping with the payment for the room also, since I couldn’t afford to get my own place or room anymore. It seemed like I was always broke. I had to put off school and getting a car, and my own place. Because all of my money went to keeping a roof or getting stuff for the baby. Maybe some food for myself. had some friends and she also helped me get some things I needed, but anybody with common sense knows that it just doesn’t stop at the baby stage. That’s a lifetime bill. Literally. She’s a smart kid though! I work with her as much as I can (I work still) and she’ll be in school soon. I’m very proud of her.. and I love her so much. I do. So .. \nTime passed, and I healed from the pain of her father and decided to start trying to date again. After a few bad apples, I found a nice guy. And I ended up liking him a lot!\n\nI .. (thought) I had waited long enough, and did everything correctly .. waiting to let him meet my kid, taking time (he asked me out exclusively after us talking for about 8 months) and “doing everything right” I guess. We ended up getting courthouse married after being together almost 3 years. \n\nFast forward to now. About a week and a half ago, I got a text from an ex of mine. Husband was asleep in the bed already. I’ll spare the details mainly bc I told him “I gotta go .” and deleted and blocked his number. Basically, I realized I’m still in love with my ex. And that I moved on because I didn’t think I would hear from him again, and I guess not because I was truly over them …? I think this also made me set in stone that we moved way, way faster than I thought we were .. and now here we are. \n\n\n(NOT my child’s father, someone else) and it was like getting point blank shot in the chest. \nAnd I cried. I cried so so much. I don’t really remember sleeping that night. \n\nI waited until the morning to tell my husband what happened, because I didn’t want to wake him out of his sleep for that, to be honest. But I couldn’t hide it from him either. Even if nothing happened. \nAnd I was honest. I told him everything, even the part about my ex, and what he said, and how I felt about it. I told him over the next following days (thinking on it) that I felt like I deserve to just be by myself if I’m still caught up in feelings with an ex of mine, because it’s unfair to everyone. Mainly him. I couldn’t fathom starting over again for YEARSSS after this.  We don’t have any shared assets or anything serious like that yet, and it still hurts as bad as the first night and I can’t help but feel like a shitty person for it. I’ve voiced this multiple times. He disagrees. \n\n\nI also feel for my daughter, because she sees him as dad. I can’t shake the feeling that I’ll hurt her the most if we don’t split up if this doesn’t get better.. which I doubt it will. He’s also only been in 2 relationships before me, and “he doesn’t think we moved too fast” :( \n\nHe’s a good man, he really is. The only thing that kills me with him is his ability to just clean the house when I’m not there. Or having to be “asked” to do chores. \nMy daughter isn’t his bio child, so I could only imagine having to go through such a big life chance in such a short amount of time? He accidentally told me he talked to a friend the other day about how he doesn’t really go out anymore and it isn’t fun.. and it made me kinda sad for some reason. Mainly for him, I reckon. \n\nAnother thing I’ve been battling mentally is the fact that.. I would kill to have a child by a man who ACTUALLY, GENUINELY LOVES ME.. but he doesn’t want children. Which I totally get and I will not make or force him to have kids he doesn’t willingly want .. it hurts me tho that that choice was taken away from me .. \nand I know I CAN have that.. … but that means divorcing . And it stings. Because I love him so much. And we like.. just eloped. This wasn’t really a dealbreaker when we were dating by the way, this is new as well. And it still isn’t now, I’m just scared that if that feeling grows, I’ll be wasting both our times :( \n\nHow did you ladies navigate feeling like you did so. SO MUCH work to be better and inner heal just for something(s) to come up and prove to you that you are nowhere near done. I’m not even looking for advice, I’m already looking into therapy. \n\nI don’t even think I need advice. Or maybe I do. I think I just need a hug, or to be told I’m doing the right thing. \nOr the wrong thing? And that everything is gonna be okay. And that I shouldn’t give up. Because I want to so, so bad and my minds been wigged down with .. well. All of this. And I got someone depending on me who didn’t even ask to be here. For a very long time. The fresh stuff is just icing on the cake I suppose. I can’t talk to my mom about it, because she’s the reason why I feel like I’m hurting so much now. I’m just lost. Thank you all for reading if you got this far. \nPlease send emergency tissues ",

      "selftext": "Today I went to Minecraft to see a new update. I haven't played for a long time, so at first I flipped through the worlds to remember how I didn't leave this game for days. After scrolling through quite a lot, I saw it – the world in which I once played with my girlfriend. And then goosebumps ran over me, my heart began to beat faster, and rabid butterflies appeared in my stomach. Memories poured on me like a river and tears came to my eyes. I liked this girl at the time. I felt like I really loved her. We've been playing in this world for six months. And we managed to build a lot. I remember I had a habit of putting up signs, writing the date and what happened during the day, saying \"so that there would be something to remember later\" if I knew that when this \"later\" would come, I would even be afraid to enter this world.\n\nWe haven't talked to this girl for a long time. I don't know where she is, how she is, or how she's doing. These were my first feelings so strong, I realised that I really loved her, because when she was sick, I was really worried about her, and when her dad was sick, she was very worried about him, and then I kind of felt her feelings on me. Even after so long, I still remember it. Of course, these were the first, not yet mature feelings, I was strongly attached to her. That's why in the last few days, our communication was very tense, I constantly wrote to her and she had no time for herself at all, because of this she was very tired of me. And in the end, I couldn't stand it and confessed to her, of course she didn't reciprocate, but with dignity, she thanked me for everything and we said goodbye.\n\nSeeing this world, I felt a strong nostalgia and sadness and I wanted to cry.\n\nI don't even know why, because I've resigned myself to the fact that she's not here and I'm not looking for meetings with her. I recognised that it was all over, I started moving on, although not immediately, but this even motivated me to move on. But today, when I saw this world, I could barely hold back my tears.",

      "selftext": "I just wanna say that I have vague memories of this period so some elements may be inaccurate and I'm sorry for that\nAlso English is not my mother language so my English may sounds weird to you \n\nI'm 19M and I was 14 when all of this started. \n\nWe were in 2021 and I created a tiktok account to post some dumb wojak memes about how shitty life is. Looking back, I find some of these videos quite cringe but it's okay I guess cuz I was just a middle schooler.\n\nA few of my videos went viral and I received some private messages from people saying stuff like \"that's litteraly me\" or \"your tiktoks are basically describing my life\". One day I received a PM from a girl, (let's call her Laura). We talked for about an hour, Laura and I were the same age and we both had the same mother language. She told me that her boyfriend created a discord server and that I would love to spend time there. (Let's call her boyfriend Adam)\n\nShe sent me the link and yes, I founded the server kinda cool, I was a big fan of edgy right wing jokes (which is NOT the case anymore 😭) and it was full of right handed young men/incels from what we could call the equivalent of 4chan but in my mother language\n\nAdam was very appreciated by the other members, they would call him a Chad and say that he would save the white race and stuff like that\n\nAfter few days of talking with these people I noticed several strange things:\n\nFirst: A lot of them carried weapons even tho it's illegal here\n\nSecondly: every time a conversation ended and everyone was like \"good night everyone\" \"see you tomorrow\" there was always someone that says \"and good night to the feds\" or \"poor feds forced to stay awake until 3am because of us\"\n\n\nI quickly founded out that this was not just a chill server with bunch of cringe right wing incels, it was the server with a group of armed political extremists and some of them even sent articles that goes like \"at [city] a man was shot in the chest and died from injuries\" as an achievement\n\n\nEven tho Adam was appreciate by everyone in the server, it seems like he was not an important member in the organization and it's pretty normal cuz he was just 16 or 17. I think he was just very active on the server, few members told me that they never let Adam participate in an important operation because of his age\n\nMy personal theory is that it was a normal server initially, then members from the organization started to join more and more. From what I remember, approximately 20% of the server was  linked to this armed organization\n\n\nFor some reasons I was not scandalized at all by all of this, I stayed pretty active, logging in 2-3 times a week to send memes, chat and stuff. I made multiple friends including someone that we're gonna call Chris\n\nNobody of my entourage knew about it, all this people that I met, nobody knew their existence not even my parents, my ex best friend or my ex girlfriend\n\n\nThis all continued until I was 15, I had been in high school for a month or two and Adam sent me a private message telling me that he was doing some modifications in the server interface and that he needed a screenshot from me of all the different channels to see how it looks like, he said that he made this request to other members to see how the interface is, depending on the roles.\n\n\nI sent him the screenshot and he immediatly kicked me from his server.\n\nIn fact it was never about interface changes, the \"truth\" is that Adam was arrested and the policeman showed him a phone screenshot of a discord server asking him \"do you know anything about this server ?\" And apparently he just stared at the screenshot trying to analyse who took it. \n\nI can't send an image to illustrate in this sub so I'm just going to describe what he saw: When you enter discord in your phone and you go on the home menu of a server, you can see on the left side of your screen all the other servers that you joined. What Adam apparently did is that he memorized all the servers on the left of the screen that the policeman showed him in order to collect screenshots from each member of the server to see who \"betrayed\" him by checking if the servers at the left matched with what he memorized.\n\nFor some reasons I happened to be seen as the traitor, I was really confused because I never took this screen\n\nMy personal theory is that Adam invented all this story to find a pretext to ban me cuz all of this seems weird to me and I don't think that it really happened this way\n\nAs I said previously, Adam was very appreciated by everyone so they got mad at me for getting him in trouble\n\n\nNo one believed me when I said it wasn't me, except for Chris, he had been talking about leaving the server for a while and strangely he liked me more than Adam.\n\nSince I was banned and he wasn't, he told me everything people were saying about me.\n\n\nIt was the first time that a group of armed dudes were furious about me and actively wanted me dead\n\nI was even more scared because I had told these guys all my informations, they knew my first name, my face and the city where I lived.\n\n\nRight after this incident I started to be afraid to leave my house. When I was going to high school I was constantly looking behind me, I was afraid of being followed in the street. At the same time, the concept of texting started to cause me anxiety. I know it may sound weird, but every time I had to talk to people through the internet, I would turn red and my heartbeat would speed up, sometimes I would even start shaking.\nAt first it was only with discord but it quickly applied on all social networks.\n\nand because of that, I couldn't answer all my friends' messages and it happened very often that I ghosted them for a very long time. The more people I ghosted, the more anxious it made me to see the number of messages I had to answer increasing more and more. and the more anxious I was, the less I answered people's messages so I was caught in a kind of vicious circle.\n\nI even uninstalled all social networks and more broadly all applications allowing sending messages except WhatsApp\n\nAs I said, it was the concept of messages that made me anxious. In high school, I had no problem talking with people, but I could never get past the \"acquaintance zone\". When people tried to talk to me through the internet, they saw that I was slow to respond or didn't respond at all, so they assumed I didn't want to talk to them.\n\nNow I'm 19 and I'm starting to heal from that, I re-installed Instagram when I entered college\n\nIt's crazy how hard it is to have a fulfilling social life without any social media.\n\nI realize that all the people I met in high school are much more important to me than I am to them. When I spoke to them for 20 minutes during break, it was my only interaction of the day, so for me it was something important, while they, on the other hand, were surrounded all day and they spoke to lots of people in one day. Besides, I'm still talking about them even though most of them have forgotten me.\n\n\nI didn't develop any relationships during the years that were supposed to be the best years of my life and all the people that I knew from before 2021 and that cared about me are know mad at me, probably telling to their friends that I ghosted them and that I suddenly stopped giving any sign of life",

      "selftext": "TW: mentions of psychical violence and SA. \n\n(I apologize for mistakes, english isn't my native language)\n\n\nIt happened few years ago and I was probably 12 when this happened. Me and my mom were laying on a sofa in my grandma's house where we were sleeping over. It was already late and really dark in the house. I turned my back to my mom, who was already sleeping, to turn on the open idea of the living room and I saw a figure. \nI didn't see the head or face, but I did see sweatpants and hoodie. I froze, wasn't thinking straight and thought that maybe parts of some lighter things that were in the room tricked my brained into seeing a figure since it was really dark, or that a ghost was staring at me, because the house was haunted anyway according to my mom's stories. After few seconds, completely starteled, I slowly put the blanket over my head and fell asleep eventually. In the morning I shrugged it off with the same reasoning that I had that night. \n\nToday this popped in my head again. And I thought that I don't think I was just seeing things as the figure was pretty clear, and what ghost would wear swearpants and a hoodie? Then it clicked, making me feel sick from my stomach. \n\nAt the time, my grandma was still with her now ex husband. And I'm almost sure that he was there that night. Now, backstory and context, that guy is f*cking disgusting creep. Around that time I didn't even want to sleep there, because months back he stabbed himself from drunkness (he drinks constantly), so I was scared that he could do that to someone else, or me, aswell. And few years later I got to know why I got such creepy vibes from him most of the time, when my cousin admitted that he SA'd her, when she was only six or seven. The worst part is that he teaches literal children to play on instruments. \n\nThat all said, I'm convinced that it was him that night and I feel absolutely disgusted. I can't, or rather don't want to, imagine what would happen if I was sleeping alone there that night. ",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone, I wanted to get something off my chest and maybe hear what you guys think. I’m not looking for sympathy, just honest thoughts. Back in 2021, I met this girl on Instagram. I was the one who messaged her first. We started talking and immediately clicked  she was smart, funny, beautiful, kind, and actually listened to me. I’d been with other girls before, but this felt different. I found myself falling for her, slowly but deeply. We talked every single day. Even though we never officially called it a relationship, it felt like one. I told her I wanted her to be my girlfriend, but she told me she had trust issues and needed time. I respected that. I told her I’d wait as long as it takes. And I meant it. For over a year and a half, we were in that “almost but not quite” space. And honestly? It was the happiest I’ve ever been. But then I started thinking about the future. I was 23 at the time. I had no job, no money, and honestly no real stability in life. I knew I wasn’t in a place to give her the kind of future she deserved. I’m not someone who dates just to pass time  if I’m with someone, it’s because I want to build something real. And that’s when I did something incredibly stupid. Instead of talking to her and explaining what I was feeling I started a fight. On purpose I said some harsh things that I knew would hurt her. Then I used that fight as an excuse to walk away. I ghosted her completely. It’s been almost 3 years now. And not a single day has passed without me thinking about her. I still have her pictures. I still remember our conversations. And yea I still love her. A few months ago, I tried reaching out. She said she forgives me, but things can’t go back to how they were. And I get that. What hurts is that I never told her the truth. She probably thinks I left because I lost interest or found someone else. But that’s not true. The truth ii I left because I loved her. And i know people will tell me u didnt love her because if u did u wouldnt left her but i know its very hard in my ( c )to build a future if u. Were born in a poor family even if u have good education there is no alight chance to grow the only thing herr is a normal job with low salary cant give her the future she deserve  And I didn’t want to waste her time when I felt like I had nothing to offer. But now I keep asking myself I made the right choice. I thought I was doing the right thing by walking away by not holding her back while I had nothing to offer. But the truth is, I never told her why I left. She never knew that it wasn’t because I stopped loving her, but because I loved her too much to let her settle for someone who wasn’t ready. I wanted her to have the life she dreamed of, even if it wasn’t with me.\nSometimes I wonder if I should’ve just been honest instead of disappearing. Maybe things wouldn’t have worked out anyway, but at least she would’ve known the truth. Instead, I became the guy who just walked away without a word the one she probably thinks never cared. And that’s what hurts the most.\n",

      "selftext": "So I’m a 23 year old male. An only child with multiple cousins I’ve grown up with. I’m a loving guy, and relatively close to a few of them. However there’s something wrong I’ve always had when I was younger. I’m sensitive to judgement or being picked on even now I think. Ever since I was young I’ve been bullied in school and have made a conscious effort as I was growing up to keep my mouth shut. But I’ve gotten out of that shell a little bit with new friends I’ve made. But my cousins, family should be fine!?\n\nFor better context: was supposed to hang out with one of my female cousins today, it’s been awhile since we’ve hung out in person, and I like to hang out with them one on one to truly bond and such. But today she surprised me by inviting another one of our cousins(who I am closer with in a sense). This shouldn’t bother anyone right? The more the merrier. But for me it ruins everything.\n\nBecause when those two are together, I suddenly become a punching bag for whatever I do, or say. Or judged. While I know they are joking half the time, I still dislike it. I found myself being quiet most of the time, either because I couldn’t relate to their favorite music choices or hot artists they adore, or because I wanted to reframe from being a target automatically. \n\nI honestly hate this and worst part is I’ve communicated this before, but I don’t think they understand how deep it can be. I want to be better too, I’m honestly trying to not let this bother. I’m trying to tell myself as a man I should stick up for myself even if it’s a joke, on the other hand don’t say a word.\n\nI love them both dearly, and they are also around my age as well. But I almost don’t want to hang out with them anytime soon just cause of this afternoon.\n\nBut I’m honestly confused on what I’m feeling, is it sensitivity, am I too easily frazzled as one of them said before, or are my emotions here legitimate.\n\nFOR MORE CONTEXT: the jokes are can be as simple, “so how’s your love life? You done being a slut?”(because i used to share details of my hookup culture life/done now) or one of my cousins holds the door for me, i walk through and the other is like “gosh why dont you hold the door, thats not really gentlemen behavior”. Or lastly, “watch out man, we know you’re a little clumsy”.\n\nOn paper I know these don’t sound too bad, but frankly they never tease each other, it’s always me and I’m not gonna lie and say they don’t bother me.\n\n\n ",

And they can't say no because they're are at the lowest point in their life. They're also in and out of the hospital.\n\nPersonally, we have lunches together with a large group of friends. I sit beside them and they just blurt out \"my mom hates me because I said I was suicidal\" or \"sometimes I wish I was just not here, you know?\" and I'm like \"no I don't know\" and I feel so awkward and uncomfortable. I don't even know why they sit with us because none of us are really friends with them? A few years ago they were kind of in our circle but left.\n\nAnother thing is they want me to throw away their stuff for them. The trash can is literally a few steps away. I swear if they ask me that again I'm saying no I'm tired of doing shit for them. Then they make me walk a very long distance to get food with them because they don't wanna go alone. (cafeteria) It's not that bad, but it is kind of annoying. Like I just wanna eat my food...\n\nI try my best to be understanding and kind to them, they're going through horrible shit. But I'm just tired of it. I feel like they're using me, and honestly I don't want them sitting with us anymore. But confrontation makes me so anxious and uncomfortable. I will still stand up for myself, though. I know one of my friends doesn't like them either, so I'm just going to talk to them about it.\n\nReal, good friends don't treat people like this. I wouldn't really consider them my friend though. I just want out of this situation honestly, but I don't know how.",

I still got through it all, graduated high school, got a four year degree, I have friends, but I lack the two things in life right now that I think makes it all worth living. I lack a career and a significant other\n\nSome people are going to tell me you don’t need either of these things to find purpose and happiness in life but I disagree from my perspective.

I think I can see why, we are smart enough to understand and relate to the world around us but our ability to express and manage emotions are damaged.

      "selftext": "\nI’m 24M from a SEA country. When I was around 10, I remember this so clearly. There was a wedding of some neighbour or other, and I was there with my family. They went to sit near the main event, and I was just outside playing alone. That’s when a man, maybe in his 50s, who wasn’t even invited to the wedding, dragged me into a shed through the sand and abused me. He groped me down there for what felt like forever until he heard voices nearby and ran away.\n\nI never told my parents. It wouldn’t have changed anything. They’re conservative, and all they would’ve said to me was “man up.” I changed after that. Before it, I was this stupid kid eating sand, always outside, had friends, laughing. After it, I couldn’t even step out of the house. School felt like torture. I’d always find excuses not to go. I couldn’t even sit through a single page of a book. I didn’t know the alphabet properly until 9th grade. My parents are teachers, but I couldn’t tell them, how could I?\n\nMy dad was always abusing my mum. I remember one time he hit her in the head, and she lost her memory for a bit. She fainted, and when she woke up, she asked me who I was and what she was doing there. I have never seen her look at me so scared, clutching my clothes like she was a kid. I had to stand between them to stop him from beating her again, and all it led to was me scratching him and him belting me. He didn’t even take my mother to a hospital.\n\nmy mum… I don’t even know. I feel protective of her, but also tired. When I was 11, still not knowing the alphabet, she started telling me how my dad was cheating, giving looks at neighbours, or how he let some woman touch him during a trip. I didn’t want to hear that. I was just a kid, already waking up every night, sweating and scared from what happened to me. And even now, when she calls me only to say shit about dad or recall the past, I don’t feel resentment towards her, I just feel tired.\n\nSchool wasn’t better. Kids bullied me because I was fat, and teachers bullied me because I wasn’t “good enough” to be in this school since I didn’t even know the English alphabet. Both of my parents agreed.\n\nIn 9th grade, I decided to relearn everything from scratch. I had almost nothing in my head to start with, but somehow I pulled through. I ended up finishing second in my school and got into med school. I’m still in med school now.\n\nWhen I got my first phone in college from my part-time job, I started reading about therapy and mental health. I should try to face what happened. But I still wake up in cold sweats, with nightmares, and every single morning I wake up with no emotional connection to yesterday. Like I can ace a test, or win something, or have a completely shitty day, and the next morning it feels like it never mattered, like it happened to someone else. I know it happened, but it doesn’t feel like me.\n\nI changed therapists a lot. Finally, I told one about the assault, but all she asked me was “how do you feel?” and all I could say was “numb.” I eventually got diagnosed with BPD.\n\nNow I live in a foreign country. I work, I rent one small room, I don’t really have friends because I keep everyone at arm’s length. I talk to colleagues, it’s not that I don’t want friends, but I honestly, for the life of me, cannot get drained by people. Even if they are sweet to me, going out to buy groceries is draining, and spending every minute talking to someone is draining.\n\nEvery day feels like dragging myself through hell just to be some average version of the person I thought I would be. It’s exhausting to even wake up.\n\n\nI just want to feel something. I don’t even care about being happy, I just want to feel genuinely sad. I don’t know why I can’t. I worked on myself a lot, I lost weight and am confident about my body, I work on my BPD, I regulate my emotions as much as I can, but all for what? How much more work do I have to do just to breathe? How many more years of self-introspection? How many more years of breathing exercises & shit?\n\nI have abandonment issues too. And I’m scared to go back to therapy because it feels like every time it’s just one more label slapped on me.\n",

      "selftext": "I (chinese 26 M) met this girl (French 30 F) who was a graduate student at the time in taiwan. It’s time go by we get close until we get pretty intimate. Our meeting time is only last two months. I tried to ask if we can be serious but she just said maybe. She keeps saying maybe because she thinks that friends will last longer compared to boyfriend. But still we get intimate. She went back to Paris and finally graduated from her degree before going to Japan. I tried to look for excuses to meet her. And I finally did meet her. Our texts are very fun because she showed some reactions but at the same time also a little bit distant and dry. A little bit forced to try to care for me and just putting a little bit of curiosity.  One time we met I told her about a certain café which we can visit. But the next day she was sick. The day after I tried to visit her to drop some medicine, but she didn’t give me an address. So I have to go back home. The next day she felt better, but she didn’t say that she wanted to meet me. I went to the Kafei that I told her, didn’t expect to meet her there, bringing a guy which was her boyfriend. I got very hurt because not only she get better so she got went out, to my recommended café, bringing a guy, but I was expecting a lot from this girl because I try to get intimate again. It’s not her fault because in the first place, she was still trying to figure things out. But I got very hurt. She only say sorry of the awkwardness when she was supposed to be sick, but she went out with that guy. But I got very hurt because she never told me about her boyfriend and still expecting that she still care for me. In the end, she’s just caring a little bit for me.\n\nI got very hurt from this, despite this is not her fault and I’m the only one who tried to make a move in the end. I got very disappointed. I don’t know if we can still continue being friends. She saw me just a friend, but I keep seeing her more than friend.\n\nI feel so stupid as I know she could have found someone else and it was only just for fun, but I keep expecting from her anyway.",

      "title": "Am I a bad person? - a weird situation",
      "selftext": "This is actually the dumbest situation ever but here goes:\n\nBasically, a couple nights ago, a family member screamed around 5-6 in the morning that they were scared of being alone in their room. I was the only one that heard (parents already went to work at this point), so I went in and laid down next to them, intending to go back to my room once they were asleep. But, I was so sleepy that I also fell asleep.\n\nI remember that I was dreaming that I was the flash and I got into a fistfight with a flash clone. At some point, the clone kicked me in the groin, and this is where idk if I fked up. So, the clone kicks me, but its gentle or whatever... and I think it's very slightly arousing somewhat. I kind of wake up but I'm in that half-asleep zone (I'm sure yk what I'm talking about). I remember one thought flashing across my mind - what if it's \\[family member\\]'s foot kicking me, which would obviously be extremely inappropriate? (family member squirms around a lot and it wouldn't be impossible that they kicked me). But, since I was in that half asleep zone, I pretty much remember thinking \"so what\" and fell back asleep. I had a sort of continuation of the same dream, but rather than being kicked by a flash clone foot, it was just a generic foot that I remember thinking was arousing, before waking up fully. I was like \"damn, that was weird\", made sure that \\[family member\\]'s foot was nowhere near me (they were all the way on the opposite side of the bed, turned away) but then fell back asleep. But ever since I woke up, I've been thinking about this for the past few days because of the following reasons:\n\n\\- on one hand, when I thought \"so what\" in my dream-ish zone, it was more like \"so what, it feels good\" rather than \"so what, I wanna fall back asleep.\" In other words, I feel like I put feeling good in front of my morals\n\n\\-on the other hand, I was indifferent to who's foot it was, and it wouldn't have made a difference to me if it was a broomstick or anything else.\n\n\\- and most importantly, being half asleep isn't really an excuse; I feel like I should've recognized something was off and woken up. Not doing so means that I don't take protecting my family members seriously enough... or does it mean I subconsciously wanted that to happen and thats why my brain convinced itself that everything was fine and fell back asleep?\n\nObviously, losing any bit of self-control is probably my greatest fear, because like most other people, I'd rather face harm than any of my family members, and harming my family would be a fate worse than any death or torture or whatever.\n\n  \n",

      "title": "I almost succumbed to my thoughts the other day.",
      "selftext": "I (22F) almost reached a point of no return the other day. I have a kid, I love her. I have my own place, my own car, a really nice job, and I’m in school. The other morning, I got so frustrated because I’m in a crap ton of debt. I only got my apartment because I convinced the landlord that I wasn’t a bad tenant, I just lived with bad people. I paid two months worth of rent as well as the next month’s rent and I’m sure he feels like I’m a reliable tenant now. That made me happy, but what’s starting to push me down is school. I got into a car accident last month, didn’t hit anyone but I hit a fire hydrant and fell asleep behind the wheel. The first thing I did when I woke up was called my boss and told him I crashed the car, he kept asking me where I was and I didn’t remember.\n\n(I’m a patrol officer and crashed my patrol car.)\n\nAnyway, I was found. PD, EMT, and my coworkers arrived and the thing I kept repeating was, “I’m going to lose my job.” I have never been in an accident before. I’ve been working overnights for 4-5 years now. But this time, I just shut down. I don’t know. I don’t remember and it bothers me. They thought I was severely injured because the fire hydrant wasn’t spraying water or anything but I somehow rolled 6-10 feet past it. I didn’t even notice that until I got in the ambulance. So, everyone was confused by the scene. Though, from that moment on, everything changed. I finally got my life on track. I finally felt settled. I got a nice home, a nice car, a nice job and then it went to shit.\n\nI told the EMT guy, “I’m going to lose my job.” He just looked at me and laughed, I don’t think it was ill intended but because he was more so like, “I think you have bigger things to worry about.” But when I arrived to the hospital, like I told them, I had no injuries. No bruises. I was only diagnosed with Syncope. This happened 2 days after school started and it killed every inch of drive in me. I was beyond frustrated.\n\nI don’t live near family. I don’t talk to my family. They’re absolutely horrible people, they thought that my accident meant that I should’ve moved to the west coast to be close to them. Now, why in the fuck would I do that? I have built stability where I’m at. Mind you, these same people don’t reach out to check on me or my daughter. Why waste my fucking time moving to people who only want me to move there to be their punching bag?\n\nThen, mind you, the dude I moved to this state with after a year of being together. Cheated on me for the whole fucking 2.5 years of being together. The whole fucking time. I found out at 4:00AM and lost my shit. I’ve not been that angry. This was around the time my best friend came to move in with me while I was with him and next thing you know, I’m running to her with my face drenched showing her the screenshots in my phone while she is completely frozen on the couch. I told her not to do anything and to let me handle it, I did. I fucking left. I left in two weeks. I called one of my best friend and he drove 8 hours to come to get me and my daughter to bring us home. That ended up being shitty. So, I moved back because it’s cheaper to live here than back home. (We live in the MW.)\n\nMy best friend who was living with me ended up staying with her family and she’s been safe since. Though, she’s my ride or die. I love her dearly. She’s back home. While I moved back, with the intention of just doing it until I got everything figured out. Although I did, I thought giving my ex a chance was a good thing. No, I haven’t taken him back. I don’t know if I will. I, for once, don’t know what I want romantically. I’m so focused on money and my daughter’s happiness that I don’t really care about anything romantic right now.\n\nI’m in therapy. I have an amazing therapist. She’s helped me understand myself a lot. I’ve built a huge community of people here. I feel safe. I have the most amazing team. But I feel so fucking stressed.\n\nI was out of work for 3 fucking weeks, no pay because my claims got denied. I had to find desperate ways to pay for daycare because my child’s daycare doesn’t have CCA. It’s the only affordable daycare I can do right now. I had to figure out how to get food. I had to pretend mommy was okay while taking her to daycare wondering how the hell I was going to fucking pay for it. Or how I was going to scrounge for food. How to make sure she had clean clothes. Making sure she had what she needed to get her hair done. I want her to be a fucking child. I just want her to be a kid. I lived my childhood always being wrapped up in adults problems and I don’t want her to be subject to that.\n\nI’m extremely exhausted. My mind got so dark when I received the email for my school pay. I was going to jump off the balcony until I sat there and bawled because I realized what I almost did. I almost gave up on myself. I almost gave up on myself and the life I’ve built. I don’t even think I can tell my friends about this. I don’t know if I want to. I just needed to vent, I’m sorry this went every where. I’m just really going through it. This car accident has changed the trajectory of everything. I hate feeling like I’m not in control.\n\nThanks for reading if you did.",

None of this came to light until after. He just seemed weird and gave off an uncomfortable vibe.\n\nHe had been pestering her to marry him for awhile. She always refused as she wasn’t ready. On the night in question, she came home from a night out to a proposal. She turned him down again.\n\nThis time was different. He beat her to death. About two hours after that he heard sounds and wanted to make sure he had actually finished the job. His idea? Samurai sword. He nearly took her head off.\n\nHe’s serving life in prison without the possibility of parole now. That’s all well and good but doesn’t bring my friend back.\n\nAbuse can escalate quickly. Take it seriously. Read What We Don’t Know About Domestic Violence Can Kill Us. Read Why Does He Do That. Educate on what abuse can look like. If you’ve got a bad feeling, make a plan with trusted people or a domestic violence resource and get out of there.\n\nDon’t wait it out. Don’t think it will get better. Don’t accept the lovebombing.

Yeah I tried to break up with her a few times at the beginning because she wasn’t meeting my needs and wants. All I wanted was to spend time together and talk on the phone and feel important/significant to her.\n\nShe said she would meet my needs and make sacrifices to spend more time with me but it didn’t happen. Yeah she tried but she’s had a pattern of saying she would do something but ends up not doing it. Yeah it might’ve just been a phone call for her but it was quality time with me. One time she chose a spontaneous hangout with her friend over me when we were in the middle of a date night that was planned. I felt like I was an afterthought or the last priority on her list.\n\nShe said “i don’t understand why you didn’t just get over it” when I was upset with her. She said I was upset with her for 1-2 days when she suddenly left to go see her friend. She just left. I felt unimportant. Not the first time she has done that. Idk why I put up with this BS. Like how do you not understand why I’m upset? She said I gave her the silent treatment and punishing her. I didn’t give her the silent treatment, I just didn’t respond with much energy because I was upset what do you expect. She didn’t make it up for me or anything. She listened to my perspective but then said she would still do it again and doesn’t regret it. Who the fuck does that?\n\nShe blamed me when I said I don’t completely trust her after she would not keep her word many times and she didn’t show me through actions that she likes me and wants to spend time with me. I told her I need to learn to trust you again and I’m working on it as long as other things in my therapy. She said “I can’t wait months or years for that. You’re in therapy but I haven’t seen any progress the past few months”. Yeah I’m in therapy but I don’t dedicate my therapy only for the relationship. I was pissed when she said that. You should’ve thought of that before you did what you did. Do you not understand there are consequences of your actions? She tried to dismiss and minimize my emotions when I was upset with her and communicated why. Like she wants me to just be okay with it and move on and be okay with getting hurt over and over. \n\nShe said I just needed to trust her when she says I like her. How is that a relationship? People usually want to spend time together with a person they like right? You can’t maintain a relationship with just words. She doesn’t understand that a relationship is more than that. Like what are you not understanding??? Have you never had a relationship with another human being other than your family ??  People don’t function like that. Those are the basic necessities for a relationship. You don’t just say oh I like you and want to hangout and be close to you and then not do it. Like hello?\n\nI don’t know how to make sense of her perspective. We’re both in our mid 20s but she acts like she has the emotional intelligence and self awareness of a rock. I can’t teach her how to be empathetic of me. I can’t always teach her about my perspective and dumb it down so much every time. She told I had to explicitly say I needed comfort after I said “I’m not enough”. I don’t think she even cared to begin with. When I texted her that, she literally started talking about her new couch. How is that relevant and did I ask? I literally did not . How is it not obvious that I need comfort/reassurance? Oh but it’s obvious to you that I wanted to hear about you talking about your new couch. Makes no fucking sense. ",

I would say this stopped when I turned 8 and learned to control my impulses.\n\nOne of the first things I stole was a plastic ring from a family friend. Funniest thing was I accidentally dropped it on the ground when me and mum were walking home and I picked it up so fast she thought I found it on the ground. And when my brother said “hey that’s (girl’s name I stole from)” my mum was like no she found that on the ground and I was like hehehe >:) yeah!\n\nWhen I started school I stole a Winnie the Pooh eraser. A girl showed it to me and I thought it was soooo cute so I sat at her desk and pretend to talk to others while I sneakily grabbed it\n\nOne of the biggest things I stole and something I def got a thrill from was when I was about 7, right at the end of the school year, this girl in my class gifted our teacher an arts and crafts book. I don’t even remember wanting it that bad but I guess I did.\n\nIt was the last day of school and we were given our portfolios - work and art and stuff we did over the year, all in a display folder. When everyone was leaving when the bell rang, I came back into the room, put my portfolio on top of the gift, pretend to tie my shoe, picked up my portfolio AND the gift - my excuse was going to be oh I didn’t realise hehe silly me\n\nI grabbed both things and tucked them close to my chest and met my dad outside my room and was like omg hurrrrrry let’s go and he was like what\n\nI just grabbed whatever I wanted lol. I guess cause we grew up kinda poor I assumed I’d never get to have any of these things so just stole them",

      "selftext": "Alright so I’m an out and proud lesbian now, but back in my second year of high school I was still closeted. Since my freshman year, I had become friends with a girl in my homeroom and we gradually became closer. We would sit in the stairwell while she drew on my arm, she would tell me about anything and everything in her life, she excitedly showed off her new tongue piercing when we were alone, she would get far closer to me than anyone else physically when we spoke. In hindsight, that was definitely flirting but I was oblivious. I was really into her and that only grew the closer we got.\n\nOne day, a year into knowing and hanging out with her like this, her and her friend came up to me in the hallway. The friend stood in front and the girl I liked stood partially behind her, looking nervous. The friend asked me point blank but gently, “are you a lesbian” and me, worried I might get outed, quickly said “no”. The girl I liked looked sad and they both walked off. After that, she mostly stayed away from me and we would only exchange pleasantries in passing. I was sad and confused but I let it go.\n\nYears later, when I was trying to sleep, I realized what happened. She was flirting with me for a year and she had asked her friend to help her ask me out but I was so panicked, I didn’t realize. The thought of “what could have been” still haunts me to this day and it’s been far longer than I’d like to admit.",

      "selftext": "28F. In June 2018 I went to another country and lived there. Then I moved back in May 2019. Before I left my country, I didn't know what I was doing with my future. And then when I went, I should have gotten a nose job instead. But I found myself in this other country, with the regret of not getting a nose job. Which sucks. I guess I just tried to get through it, and when I got a nose job in September 2019 after coming home, I felt a lot better. I got 40g from my grandpa for turning 21. I got it only after I got back home even though it had been 10 months since I did turn 21. I used it to live on coz I found work after coming back home but I quit. In like September 2020 the money ran out but I started getting paid by the government for not having a job, and now in 2025 I am still getting payments but it's because of Schizophrenia. I get more money in July 2027. I am really looking forward to that. I just hope that before that, my pension will be renewed so I won't have to work in 2026 and 2027. I am very scared of this time, just because I know it will be hard to find a job and I have Hashimoto's. In 2017, I finished a degree I didn't like and don't want to do anything with. Maybe it's just nice to have on my resume but I wish I had more than that you know? \n\nI feel like my life started again in 2019 (and I don't like that) and I still feel unresolved about going to my other country in 2018, and I feel like this is a massive regret still. I met my ex-boyfriend/twin flame there, but I am blocked. I just wish I didn't feel so disconnected, I wish things were better. Maybe it's the country that I live in now, but I really don't like living here. I want to be back in my other country so bad. \n\nI am very jealous of another girl's life and career, and her light, and the light that life shows/gives her. I met her over there in 2018, and I honestly just wish life chucked me something good. I don't want to be sitting here like a sitting duck for January 2026. I want to have a skill like her. When I moved out in 2019 to another suburb, I met this guy and he was so cute but I was still in love with my ex and f-ed up because of this girl and her amazing career and me having no job and hating my country.\n\nI don't want to move somewhere else in my country because all my family is here in this city. I can't move to the other country I want to be in so bad because I don't have the money. I just have to stay here and it's very unexciting and bleak. \n\nI want to be successful so bad. I want to do something fun so bad every day. But I'm just stuck in my room. I tried dating apps but thinking of deleting them.\n\nYeah, I guess I just want life to be better. And it's not. Which sucks. With this girl, she lives in San Francisco. She is a tattoo artist. I saw her Instagram post of someone lighting a joint for her while she is tattooing. I feel embarrassed that I'm not that cool. I feel awful that I'm not as successful as her. I am actually miserable I'm not her. I just want to tell someone, without them judging or looking down on me or cutting me with a sympathy knife. She's just so gorgeous, why didn't God give me the opportunity to be her?? \n\nHopefully there is something I can do with the money I get in 2027, other than buying a car, that will make me feel free. I'm just excited. Maybe I could go to Japan or San Francisco (but I don't tattoo and I'm not good at art). Honestly, it's the only thing I have. To look forward to. Other than that, I feel like everything sucks. I feel like I can't even compete with people, like their life is much better, happier. Even if I get the pension again, or find work, I feel like I won't have a good enough life and won't be able to compete. It just sucks. \n\nMaybe I will use that money to move past my 20's. It has been such a challenging decade. I still don't know what I want, and I haven't really known ever. But some things since I was 20 have been really sh\\*tty.",

      "title": "Settlers Agricultural High School, 1994",
      "selftext": "The year I spent at Settlers Agricultural High School near Warmbaths in South Africa was honestly the worst year of high school and boarding school I ever had. The buildings were already dilapidated when I arrived in 1994, but the true horror was the institutional cruelty that the teachers and management openly allowed.\n\nThe environment was hectic and often traumatic. We were forced into non-stop chores: scrubbing the long hostel passages on our hands and knees during the week, and with a harsh scrubbing brush on a Saturday. This level of cleaning was degrading and exhausting, and speaks to a lack of funds management for custodial staff, under the guise of discipline and a lesson for the learners. \n\nThe culture was defined by terrible hazing rituals inflicted on the Grade 8s. They made us carry a \"baby rock,\" dress in humiliating outfits of pigtails and pyjamas, and perform rituals designed to strip away our dignity in front of the whole school. When it was my birthday, I was forced to kiss a pillar in front of all the boarders during the breakfast line-up. The boys jeered, shouting, \"Your first kiss!\" The whole school laughed. It was a humiliating and deeply traumatic moment.\n\nI remember not really making any friends that whole year. I used to lash out at teachers and other boarders which was my own desperate reaction to being constantly threatened and having no safe place to turn. The only solace I could find was when I snuck into the hall in the afternoons to play the piano. That was my single moment of happiness and peace in a place that just felt broken.\n\nOne time, a fellow student who disliked me falsely claimed that the clothes in my trunk, which were waiting to be ironed, were dirty washing. The prefects came in, took all my clothes, and forced me to wash all the colours together in hot water, knowing the dye would run and ruin practically everything I owned. To top off this malicious act, they then forced me to hang the wet, colour-bleeding clothes on the bannisters, where every student could see and mock me. No one faced any consequences for this malice.\n\nThe absolute worst violation, though, happened after someone found a dirty sanitary pad in the girls' bathroom. The prefects decided the only way to solve it was to line up all the girls in the wing and make us pull down our pants and panties for an inspection. I was only 12, pre-pubescent, and told them I hadn't even started my period yet, but they didn't care. They forced every one of us to expose ourselves. Again, this profound violation just happened, and there were zero consequences for the prefects. They truly believed they could do whatever they wanted.\n\nLater that year, I was falsely accused of theft when another student's money went missing. Prefects stormed my room, turning my entire cupboard and bed upside down, and accusing me of being a thief. While this was happening, After they failed to find the money, they eventually found it hidden with the actual culprit. I was never apologised to.\n\nThankfully, my behaviour (my desperate lashing out) became so unmanageable that the school called my mother. She had no choice but to pull me out at the end of Grade 8. That forced removal was the only way I could escape that totally traumatic environment. ",

      "selftext": "My mom started drinking when i was in second grade so like age 7 or 8, i lived with her until i was 11 as my dad finally decided to move out with me and my brother because how bad her drinking got. But even after we moved away im still greatly effected by her to this day. Im used to not seeing her for months at a time and her showing up randomly and expecting everything to be fine promising me this time, she’ll be sober for good and that she’s going to be a good mom now and there for me. It’s never true and usually a week or a few days later she’s drinking again. I have so much pent up resentment towards her that even when she’s sober and “trying to be a good mom” for those 2-3 days i can’t help but be mad and passive aggressive towards her anytime im near her.\n\nA really bad memory i have of her is when my mom lived with my grandparents after we moved out, i remember me (maybe age 12 or 13) and my brother (15 or 16) visited for a week and my mom was going through one of her real bad benders where she would get very depressed and lash out. I remember her standing staring at the bathroom light for hours and wouldn’t let anyone inside. After a few hours she opened the door, still staring at the light and said she was archangel and told me she was going to die that night. of course me being like 12 i really believed her and cried for her all night.\n\nA few days later there was a huge argument that had started with my grandma and my mom where i think my mom claimed my grandma was the devil and this greatly upset my grandma which is very religious. I don’t remember exactly what happened but i was in the living room and suddenly i see my mom run towards my grandpa which was on his bed and start getting on-top of him and hitting him and yelling at him. i remember my brother pulling my mom off him and my grandma yelling saying for me to call the police.\n\nim 17 now and my mom is still a alcoholic and now a drug user and homeless. a month ago i saw her after maybe 5 months of her being MIA and she was definitely on something and yelling outside my house demanding to see my brother and me and screaming up and down the street for a good hour. it was just me at home and it was very scary. i called my dad and told him about what was happening and to come home because he was out with his friends and he seemed annoyed, i guess since i've been dealing with this from a early age he just decided i should be used to it and it shouldn’t effect me at all anymore. This was pretty shocking and i just cried by my self the rest of the day. When he eventually came home he was visibly annoyed and said, “okay i’m here now. are you going to hug me or what?.” i told him i needed someone here with me and this was his attempt to try to cheer me up\n\nIt’s affected me my whole life, i’ve dealt depression, anxiety, dissociation and suicidal thoughts since i was a kid. And since seeing her a month ago i’ve been going through a lot of dissociation and suicidal thoughts. I have no one to talk about any of this with because everyone else in my family doesn’t like to talk about it or i guess were not as effected as i was. I’m also a girl and growing up with pretty much no mother figure or even a sister has made me feel behind in a lot of things girls my age know how to do like makeup or doing hair.",

I did tell them there was a concert, but they thought I didn't actually buy the tickets. I did, and I will be going by myself. Can't lie I'm not worried going by myself to another city, and I am feeling a little homesick because I'm overseas studying for uni, and I know it'll feel lonely by myself standing with my glowstick at the concert. But I want to go! I don't know, maybe I am being stupid by not telling my family where I'm going. There's a lot of horror stories about people going missing and their family not knowing where the victim had gone in the first place, and I know I'll feel lonely too.\n\n\n\n",

      "selftext": "A few years ago I (M) told my best friend I had thoughts of raping him.\n\nWe went to different schools so we met online through mutual friends. Even though we never hung out irl, he quickly became my best friend. At the time I was really lonely and contemplating suicide, but gaming with him and texting him really made me feel better.\n\nAt some point I had these intrusive thoughts of raping him. I was so confused. I never had any thoughts like that before. I didn't know why I was getting these thoughts, but I did know I'd never do that. Growing up closeted in a conservative area with no role models, not knowing other gay people, and having few friends, I didn't know who to talk to. In fact, I had no one to talk to.\n\nEventually the guilt became too much and I told him. Expectly, he ghosted me and we haven't talked since. A part of me always wondered if the intrusive thoughts had anything to do with my own fear of being raped. Luckily I haven't had any intrusive thoughts since.\n\nMy parents always thought nothing was wrong with me besides that I was lazy because I gamed too much, so they refused to take me to a doctor to be checked out for mental issues when I asked them to. There's probably a bunch of shit wrong with me that never got diagnosed.\n\nSometimes I tell myself that I'm over him, but then I dream about him costantly. Whenever I dream about him, it's usually him either being completely disgusted of me or him forgiving me. Either way, I always end up crying.\n\nWhenever I think about reaching out, I think about how happy he must be. He travels, has a girlfriend, and is pretty popular. While he was my best friend, I'm probably no more than an uncomfortable blip in his life.\n\nI wish I knew what he thinks about me. Though, at this point he probably never thinks of me. Back then I should have told him about how much he met to me, that I loved him like a brother. However, the time has passed.\n\nI haven't been so depressed since then until now. I don't go outside except for work and biweekly/monthly groceries. I struggle to eat so a good amount of the food spoils anyway. I lie in bed most of the time sleeping because it's really easy. Recently I bought a gun in case one day I decide I miss him too much.",

      "selftext": "I’ve never been close to my grandfather. Even beyond our language barrier (he can't speak english), I hardly saw him growing up, and even less as an adult. Our interactions have always felt more like formalities. No birthday cards or calls. Honestly, it feels like talking to a family acquaintance every time I meet him. From what I’ve heard from my mother and aunts, he was never a great father or husband either.\n\nHe's an old man pushing 90 now, and naturally his health is declining. I can’t help but feel horribly annoyed at him for it. The first major health scare happened while I was on a long awaited trip to Switzerland with my immediate family and aunt to celebrate my brother's graduation. We got a call that my grandpa was in the hospital, my aunt left the trip early to be with him in his supposed ‘final moments’, and my mum spent the rest of the trip crying, so we cut it short. He lived in the end.\n\nAfterwards, Covid hit, and for seven years I never left my country, even after the pandemic let up. So, finally, my family gets around to planning another big, fun trip to Japan, which was meant to be my extremely belated graduation trip (graduated during Covid) and birthday trip all in one.\n\nWe are currently one week away from the trip. So, what happens? We get the call: my grandfather’s in hospital for another stroke, my mom’s crying and wanting to pull out of the trip, my dad’s telling us to “stand by” because grandpa might not make it, and I’m just internally cursing him out. Because of course he’d get a stroke NOW, after seven years of fucking nothing, right before my big trip.\n\nYes, I know I sound like a horrible, selfish person. That's entirely valid, because I think so too. I know nobody wants to die, let alone die in a manner that inconveniences others. But I can't help being angry at him, that this complete stranger I'm 'obligated' to grieve for is just ruining the family fun I could be having.\n\nAnyway, I just wanted to get my bad vibes out somewhere and not affect the rest of my family who may actually be grieving, especially my mother.",

Mate, thats just how collies are, they are curious and playful little buggers.\n\nanyway, she moved in a few weeks ago. first few days were alright, bit crowded but manageable. then buddy got into the laundry one arvo and chewed up one of her socks. my bad, left the door open. thought it'd be no big deal.\n\nshe lost her shit. yelling, saying she's sick of dog hair and how she cant relax with him around. then she hits me with it.\n\nits me or the dog.\n\nI actually laughed, thought that was a pisstake but no, she was dead serious.\n\nso i just said that i'd had Bud longer, and at least he doesn't crack it over socks, but that went down as well as a warm beer. she packed a bag, called me an 'actual asshole' and left.\n\nits been a few days now, house is quiet. and the dog is lying next to me right now, happy as.\n\nI dont know, but i do know that dogs dont gaslight ya, dont start fights, and are always stoked to see you. so yeah I chose my dog and I wouldn't change a thing.\n\n  \n",

      "title": "My coworker thinks I was groomed",
      "selftext": "I (M25) work in the mental health field and recently befriended a coworker (F29). We were sharing stories last night and I shared a funny story of how I hooked up with my high school librarian (F30). Her reaction wasn’t what I expected.\n\nFor the backstory, my junior year in 2016-2017, I was 16 when I met a 22 year old new librarian (Gonna call her “Susan”) at my high school. I was super extraverted and got along well with the school library staff, and I hit it off with this worker. We talked about interests, and sometimes she even let me sit behind the desk with her to just chat, no other students were allowed to do that. I remember when I was about to graduate towards the end of senior year in May 2018, Susan said we could keep in touch and that I could friend her on Facebook and send graduation pics after I graduated. I did so, and we kept in touch. We also agreed to wait until I was 18 to hang out. So in December 2018, we hung out at Panera and talked. I won’t lie, I was a virgin at the time and super sexually curious, so only if she was comfortable with it, I asked her questions about that stuff. Some of the stuff she told me was breaking the hymen and using extra lubricated condoms so they wouldn’t break.\n\nSusan even sent me her music playlists, and I said I’d share some thoughts. I remember she messaged me saying I still hadn’t let her know what I had thought when I hadn’t listened to them yet. And that next summer, I remember one night where she was snapping me ranting about how her boyfriend was treating her while she was literally lying in bed with him. June 2019, she asked if I wanted to get boba, and I said sure. But my family thinking it was sus, very much hella talked me out of it. I made an excuse and said I couldn’t meet, and Susan said she understood. And we pretty much lost touch after that. \n\nWell, in my last semester of grad school in April 2024, I got super high and texted a bunch of people from my past, including former classmates and teachers. This included Susan, and we reconnected through text for a bit. Turned out she was a mom now of a baby. And I actually forgot to message Susan again for a month. So when I did reach out again, she ignored me a few times. I asked if everything was alright, and she sent a paragraph about how I hurt her going off contact for a month. I just validated her feelings and apologized, and we planned to meet that September. She even admitted she still viewed me as that kid from high school. Well, she later told me she couldn’t actually hang out with me anymore because she didn’t wanna cross a boundary and do something to me she’d regret. And she mentioned how she had a baby with her (same) boyfriend that she wasn’t fully sure about. I asked if she was questioning if she had feelings for me, and she said that was exactly it. \n\nSo we didn’t talk again for a while. Then July 2025 comes around and she’s posting stuff on her story about letting people go. I wanted to be nice and slid up to check in, and she revealed she painfully let her bf go. I offered to hang with her if she was still down, and she was happy about that. We made plans for the 4th to see fireworks, but to be safe with everything going on in the world, I offered her to come to my apartment that day. Well, she texted saying she was a mess and couldn’t actually come over. I told her I understood and she asked to call. I bit the bullet and asked on the phone if she was scared we were gonna have sex, and she confirmed it. I proposed she could either come over and we’d do it once and never again, or she could just come over and we could hang out as friends and nothing else. I stressed that no matter what, we’d still be friends. She also admitted she catches feelings easily for people that are kind to her, and that she did find me cute and had gotten to watch me grow up. Well, she came over and we caught up as it had been our first time seeing each other in person since that December 2018 Panera trip. \n\nShe admitted she was still super worried about the ethics of it all as I was a kid when we met. She even admitted regretting seeing me at Panera in December 2018. I’ll admit I didn’t see an issue at the time and pointed out that some real life couples meet when one is a minor at the time. I also pointed out that I was now 24 and she was 29 and we were both consenting adults. Ultimately she was down for it and we fucked. Weeks later, she told me that she was going to couple counseling with her bf and had been requested to not see me anymore. And she went on another schpeel about how she was mentally messed up and everything. I straight up told her I was disappointed by the cycle but still wished her luck and happiness. She responded wishing me the best, and I didn’t say anything. Weeks later, I saw a deleted message from her on Snapchat, but I didn’t respond. Later on, she unfollowed me on all social media. \n\nI will just say right now that I knew even then I never would’ve done the same if I had been in her shoes with someone I met as a kid. But I didn’t see anything wrong with us fucking at the time since we were adults, and I didn’t at least feel weird. But after I told my coworker this story, she told me I was groomed and it wasn’t my fault. And that Susan should’ve known better and might’ve even had some feelings when I was a kid.\n\nI don’t know what to think. I’m sure I’ll definitely have people attacking me in the comments and saying it’s my fault. And also people saying I was indeed groomed. Either way, wtf is life. ",

      "selftext": "I can’t believe it took me this long to realize it, and I’m devastated. Years of consuming harmful, toxic content led me to hurt my boyfriend in the cruelest way and break up with him over something that was originally his fault, but was minor and 100% fixable in our relationship. The way I dealt with this conflict is so far from who I believe I am and who I want to be. It has taken me away from the emotional safety and compassion I’ve always wanted in a relationship.\n\nBefore meeting my boyfriend, I (F31) had been single for 6+ years. There are multiple reasons for that, but what stands out is that my dating experiences were quite unsuccessful. I was often pursued by men but rarely felt seen, heard, or understood when I was younger (I was considered conventionally attractive). Combined with a couple of abusive relationships, it’s no surprise that my feelings toward men and relationships became… bleak.\n\nI also live alone in a different city, working a high demanding job with very few friends (I only have one friend I see regularly), so I’m lonely and consider myself “chronically online.” Over the years, I found myself absorbing certain online narratives without realizing how harmful they were, mostly by doomscrolling TikTok videos, Reddit posts, tweets, and threads. These narratives usually sounded like:\n\n-“Men are trash, and the state of men has passed the point of no return.”\n\n-“Not dating men is natural selection to weed out the undeserving.”\n\n-Encouragement to join the 4B movement: not dating, sleeping with, marrying, or having children with men.\n\n-“Men are women’s natural predators.”\n\n-“The only way a straight relationship works is between a misandrist and a submissive man.”\n\n-Identifying as a misandrist.\n\n-“Boundaries with men should be firm. If a man crosses one, there are no second chances, one mistake and he’s out.”\n\n-“The male loneliness epidemic is well deserved and should get worse.”\n\n\nThere were also endless “dating horror stories,” “marriage horror stories,” true crime content, and posts celebrating “savage comebacks”, with screenshots of rude or cruel responses to men in dating or conflict situations. Many were intended as entertainment, but in the comment are women hyping each other up, sharing similar anecdotes, or bragging about how they “got back” at a guy. Reading these posts made me feel good about myself, as being single felt cool and empowering, like I was “dodging bullets” by avoiding relationships and marriage, and that way I use those content to distract myself from my loneliness. \n\nThen I met my boyfriend and fell for him. He’s kind, thoughtful, self-aware, and respectful of my boundaries. He understands my trauma with men and has his own past relationship trauma, too. We worked together as a team through conflicts. But my brain had already been rotted by these online narratives. I still wanted to assert dominance in the relationship: if I made a mistake, I could apologize and we’d move on, but if he made a mistake, he was “out.” I didn’t realize how unbalanced that was. And despite that, he continued to be kind, loving, and understanding.\n\nThe other day, he was sleep-deprived and snapped at me. I got angry. It wasn’t too aggressive, but I acted cold and cruel, I dismissed his excuse and apology, called him names, and demanded a breakup the next day without giving him a chance to speak because I “didn’t want a man to ever raise his voice at me.” When he tried to see if we could work through it, I heard myself quoting some online nonsense, but this time it was my voice: “I told you already, one strike and you’re out.”\n\nAnd he just… agreed. He calmly told me that my boundary system was harsh, but he’d agreed to it in the beginning, and now he was leaving. That’s when it hit me. I wasn’t being a “girlboss.” I had thrown away a relationship because I wanted to see myself as having the upper hand in a conflict. Five months of happiness and then one fight and its over. And I took some advice I saw online to apply it on my real life partner not being  aware that it maybe work on some awful man out there but NOT my boyfriend.\n\nThe worst part is that I didn’t see it coming until it was too late. I don’t have friends who know how deep I was in those online spaces to call me out. I’ve been in therapy, but I never brought up my relationship because there were no major issues before. No one noticed I was being influenced by these harmful narratives.\n\nMy experience feels similar to how some men descend into the manosphere pipeline, and it cost me a great man, emotional safety, closeness, and even my sense of self, because I don’t even know who I am anymore. I have a therapy session this afternoon, and I know it’s going to be a long journey to unwind my brain from this. But I wanted to share this because I know I’m not the only one. We have to be vigilant about the content we consume online, or it can quietly cost us our well-being and our relationships. :(\n\n\nEdit: thank you everyone for the kindness. It took me lots of mental work to come to terms with this and I'm taking this chance to reflect and take the right next step into distance myself from hateful discourse online and heal my relationship. I gave him a sincere apology with full acknowledgement of my wrongdoings and promised to work on it in therapy (I did actually brought up this issue with him one time before, about how I'm exposed to a lot of toxic online narratives but we didnt think of it as something too serious), with an offer to get back together. He is hurt for sure but is graceful enough to give me another chance and I'm determined to get better :)\n\nTo all the girls coming to my post saying I'm a male or bot and making this up, shame on you, I believe we could all do better and destroy the relationship with the good men in our lives is harmful for everyone. We need all hands on deck for true gender equality and being hateful is not it.\n\nAlso for extra context: I'm East Asian who lives in Asia, and English is my second language. And even though the radical feminism movement here is relatively similar and in sync with what's happening worldwide or in the US, please understand I might have different understanding and outlook on radical feminist movement based on my algorithm, education and upbringing. I don't mean to attack true feminists who are doing the good work for women worldwide, and if I somehow came off wrong or offended some women in this group please understand I didn't mean to be a pick me or misogynist :(",

      "title": "My relationship with my mother is starting to drive me to drink.",
      "selftext": "I feel like a whiny fourteen-year-old writing this (I’m 24F for context), but I really need to yell into the void for a sec, so bear with me if you can. \n\nMy mother isn’t abusive by a long stretch, but she is overbearing to a degree that drives me up the wall. She had a traumatic childhood and learned to cope with it by establishing total order and control over everything around her (with the possible exception of my dad, but he generally goes along with whatever she wants to do anyway). I’ve made my armchair diagnoses already but it’s not anything I’ll get into here. Money and messes were especially triggering for her before, and that’s on steroids now that her mother has passed and grief has been thrown into the mix. I empathize deeply with all of that, and accord her as much grace and patience as I’m able. I try my hardest to accommodate her, and I rarely argue back if she tells me to do something. But the ways she strives for those two goals of order and control just aren’t healthy. \n\nAs a teenager, she’d constantly tell me to clean my room. Now, you’re probably thinking this is a perfectly reasonable thing to say to a teenager, but her idea of ‘it looks like a bomb went off’ is my bed unmade, a few papers and books cluttering the flat surfaces, and at most ten items of clothing on a chair. That was the worst I ever let it get. And hooooo boy god forbid I left a tote bag or a pair of slippers on the otherwise clear floor. Once an uncle came to stay overnight while my parents were out of town, and he commented that the house barely looked lived in. That’s when it clicked for me that I would never be able to meet her standards, because what the rest of the world sees as a space that’s being lived in, she sees as an awful mess that needs to be cleaned immediately.\n\nSeveral times a month I would come back home at the end of the day to find my bed made and everything that was out put away in whatever space it would fit. Having to then ask her where my own things were was humiliating, and it always gave me this crawling feeling that my space was not my own, but her borderline compulsive need for order trumps all. Plus I couldn’t very well deny her entry because it’s her house and I was studying full-time until earlier this year so I wasn’t paying bills, but I did muster the courage to set a boundary that she is not to touch anything in my room without asking me. \n\nI then came back from a weeklong trip to her telling me she rearranged things to make everything fit in my closet, and could I go through that box of smaller boxes to get rid of it? It was taking up too much space for no good reason. At least she had enough shame to be mortified when I told her it was keepsakes from a friend I’d violently fallen out with that I wasn’t ready to revisit yet, and hasn’t rearranged my things since.\n\nAnother time, I had to hold the threat of finding sex toy warranties over her head to stop her from going through my receipts, all because she really really REALLY needed to find a receipt for a return she wanted to make the next morning (the store had already closed by that time) and didn’t want to wait an hour until I’d be free to find it for her. Again, THE STORE WAS ALREADY CLOSED. \n\nBoth of these incidents happened in the last year. I don’t know what parent thinks this is still okay behavior with a literal TWENTY-FOUR-YEAR-OLD. The plausible deniability of me being fresh out of my teen years and all that comes with that is long gone. \n\nAnd then there’s the way she asks me to help. I’ll admit I was lazy as a teenager and tried to get away with doing the bare minimum, which is probably why I didn’t notice the pattern until now. I’ll accept blame for fostering this dynamic if blame is due, because I’ve experienced how annoying it can be when it takes less energy to do the task yourself than to explain to someone else how to do it. But even if she asks me for help, she doesn’t LET me help. A few weeks ago she said she was stressed out with everything she needed to do that day, so I offered to make a list and go get the groceries for her while she focused on other, more specialized home reno tasks at home. She looked at me like I was deranged and said, ‘You won’t buy what’s on sale.’ Plus, the twenty-minute round trip on the bike through a safe part of town was ‘dangerous’. \n\n(I’ve since fact-checked my numbers with a very frugal friend of mine who’s been living independently for twelve years, and I barely spend more a week per person than he does. Aside from essentials and seasonal fresh produce, I EXCLUSIVELY buy what’s on sale. But since it’s household money being spent outside of my mother’s direct control, nope, clearly it isn’t being stretched far enough, because no one can EVER keep their spending to a reasonable level except her...)\n\nWhen we’re cooking family meals together, she’ll critique my way of doing things and take over my tasks, then wonder why she’s so tired from making the meal. And don’t get it twisted: I am a very able cook. This week I recreated one of her soups with no transcribed recipe so perfectly she said it could’ve been her own cooking. And then the very next day she told me my burner was on too high when I was only cooking for myself. I’m sure she would have been backseat cooking for the soup too if she’d been there when I made it. Like mind your own business for fuck’s sake, I’m too hungry to cook the bacon on low and I want it so crispy you can hear me bite into it a block away. Is that too much to ask???\n\nAll this to say, I’ve started noticing a trend and I don’t like it at all. My parents just finished renovating their cabin (soon to be main residence) and are getting our house in the city ready for sale to retire off the profits. Tensions are high, and I’m doing what I can to be extra helpful and mindful of their feelings right now, especially since I got laid off and I’m home more. I start the day calm, then progressively get angrier and angrier with every time my mom’s voice sharpens with stress, or my dad crashes around with tools or stuff we have in storage in the basement. Every time my mom critiques my lack of zeal for the job search, or tells me my space isn’t ‘clean’, or micromanages the way I do the renovation tasks she asks for help with, my blood starts boiling, and it’s all I can do not to start screaming at her to let me live or leave me alone. It’s something I never dared to do as a teenager, and doing it now would be childish because I know it’s just stress, but GOD it is so so so tempting.\n\nIt’s even worse at the cabin, which is half the size of the house. The walls are paper-thin and I feel like none of the space is my own. The only two places I can escape to are the guest room I use or the bathroom, unless I want to fuck off to the woods on foot for a couple of hours. I don’t drive, and it’s not like she’d let me take the car even if I did. So instead, I’ve been drinking.\n\nI don’t buy alcohol for myself, because once I start, 8/10 times one glass of wine turns into the full bottle and then some, not to outrun any demons, but just because it’s fun. I restrict my drinking to social gatherings every month or two where my friends won’t care if I get sloppy drunk. But my dad loves pairing wine and roasts, and a minimum of four bottles make the trip up with us any time we come to the cabin. I drained at least half of that the last two times we were here, probably more, because I just kept drinking until the sound of my mom’s voice didn’t make me want to yell at her. I was craving a beer at noon today after she yet again tried to micromanage the way I was making my lunch. I don’t even LIKE beer, I just wanted something to mellow me out so I could stay civil. Even now I’m fighting the impulse to go grab the rest of the wine left over from dinner because I’m still not calm. I’m never completely calm anymore unless we’ve been in separate houses for a few days.\n\nI love my mom so much, and I know how much she loves me. She went through years of fertility treatment to have me, and tells me regularly how proud she is of me. But fuck if it’s not about the job search or schooling or the reno the disinterest is immediate when I talk to her. She doesn’t have any space to have meaningful conversations about my interests with me (while I listen and ask lots of engaging questions as she talks about hers), but somehow has tons to micromanage and criticize. In the past couple of years I feel like the warmth I remember from my childhood has slowly been leeching away. I’d already lost a mother and gained a drill sergeant before the renovations, but now our collective stress levels are making that worse in ways I didn’t even realize were possible. I hate that I’m so conflict-avoidant I’d rather encourage my binge drinking than tell her. But what’s the point in fighting for mental space she doesn’t have?\n\nAt this point, I’m just praying I can get another full-time job soon so I can get an apartment or therapy, because I know none of this is healthy. Ideally both. But I don’t have that kind of money right now, so I’m here venting to reddit and hoping that helps something. Have a good night yall",

      "selftext": "My boyfriend (35M) and I (29F) have been together on and off for about 6 years and lived together. One of my coworkers has always had a thing for me and my boyfriend would always feel insecure about it, but I always told him not to worry and that we were just friends. My BF never really believed that. At one point he found some deleted messages between me and the coworker and became very suspicious. He was already suspicious and insecure in the relationship because I had cheated on him early on in the relationship with an ex.\n\nLast September, we were having some issues and working through them in couples therapy. I decided to leave the relationship and while my BF wasn’t home, I left him a note saying that it was over and took all of my things from the house. I suspected that he had played with himself while I was at work that day and that put me over the edge. I also blocked him on everything so he couldn’t try and contact me to talk about it. I am very avoidant and couldn’t deal with the conversation. He tried to reach me for weeks through letters, social media, etc., but I never responded. The next month I started seeing my coworker (the one he was suspicious about) and we were physical several times over the next few months.\n\nAround the holidays, I started missing my ex and reached out to meet up with him. I didn’t really want to get back together but I wanted him in my life. We started hanging out and he tried for the next several months to get a commitment but I didn’t want to. We kept hanging out until Valentine’s Day of this year when I decided I didn’t want to commit to him and I left him again without telling him and blocked him so he couldn’t try to reach out.\n\nSeveral months later, in May, I was really drunk one night and missed him and wanted to see him. In the middle of the night I started knocking on his door and begged him to let me in. He refused at first but eventually he let me in when I wouldn’t stop. We ended up talking after that and eventually decided to get back together. One of his conditions for getting back together was that I would rebuild trust, particularly when it comes to my coworker, and also promising that if he ever wants to see my phone, he can. He asked me to get a new job because he didn’t trust me working with that person anymore. I committed to doing that.\n\nIt’s now been about 5 months since we’ve been back together and I still haven’t found a new job. I honestly haven’t really looked too hard. My BF is not happy about the fact that I am still working with the coworker every day and he doesn’t trust me.\n\nFast forward to tonight, we were in a fight because I suspected he played with himself while I was at work this week.  He denied it but I feel like he did.   He asked to see my phone and I started getting defensive and refused to let him go through it. He eventually did and found texts between me and the coworker from when we were broken up talking about intimate things between us. He also saw that I was still talking to the coworker the week I got back together with him when I had asked the coworker to come see my sister’s new baby. He is very upset and doesn’t feel like he can trust me...\n\nUpdate - so I have a confession to make.  I am the boyfriend here and I posted this on our “joint account”.   I wanted to see what Reddit thought about this whole situation.  She is really upset with me for posting this on our joint account.  She feels like I violated her trust and embarrassed her.  And she feels like I left out her side of the story.  Was I wrong here?",

Record Store Day.\n- Started flirting with and eventually dating my very close cousin (more like a brother with how we were raised) despite my obvious discomfort\n - Told me, in detail, CONSTANTLY about her intimate life with said cousin… against me begging her not to.\n - Laughed and made frequent jokes about my very recent S/A & wouldn’t acknowledge that it was S/A\n- (LIE) told me my family thought i was crazy + didn’t like me \n- when i told Karen that i would not be returning to college due to severe mental health problems, to which she made the entire situation about me abandoning her\n- told complete strangers about my personal life as well as blatant lies about me\n\nAll of these add to her pattern of behavior…. She’s done this to multiple people in the exact same if not very similar way.\nWhile I have cut this person out of my life the best I can myself as well as others have dealt with this bullshit for YEARS.\n",

We got close over the summer, it felt like he was future faking from the start. He's very into material items, I'm not. Something felt off when he talked about his recent x wife.  Allegedly she cheated and he had an on again off again relationship for 6 years after with her. They share one child. She eventually divorced him and changed her name.\nHe has been hiding that he's been living on the financial edge for a while. He was making a good amount of money until recently, he got laid off. We talked today about his situation and he came to the conclusion that he needs to move out of his rental before he gets evicted. I agreed with him and said he is welcome to temporarily stay with me if needed. He said he had no options and his family doesn't want him around. He agreed that he would stay temporarily but was reluctant in his tone. He called back two hours later saying he talked to his X who will help him financially and his mom. None of them know about me except his son. He claimed he will move in with his mom and get work from his X inlaws. \nI had told him sometime ago that he should go back to her. He was of course offended.\n I was speaking from my consciousness. I have strong intuition. I see his actions and words have always been opportunistic with lots of things. \nNow if I walk away I will look like I was with him because he gave me princess treatment and now that will stop since the financial cat is out of the bag. He was so stressed the last two days he would barley touch me. \nI feel a bit used by his trickery because I definitely feel his ex will try to get him back and he will fold. I have been super supportive the last week to him but now I feel like I'm wasting my energy. I feel some type of way about the X not knowing about me. Idk how to feel. She sounds manipulative. \nHe admitted his X originally won him over because she financially saved his ass when they first met. \nI don't find much to salvage with a grown man who's moving into his parents house.  \nI don't want to discard him but shits about to get weird.  Either way I see him being brought to his knees. It's wild to watch and process as a reader mentioned he was approaching dark night of the soul energy. I'm feeling his energy as parasitic.

      "title": "Single Mom's Nightmare: I Think I'm Being Cyberstalked, and a Security Scan Just Confirmed It – But I Have No Idea Who. Help?",
      "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm a 32-year-old single mom to a 5-year-old little girl who's my entire world. We live in a quiet suburb, and I've been grinding through the chaos of solo parenting – late nights at my remote job, school pickups, and trying to squeeze in a sliver of \"me time\" on social media where I scroll for mom memes or the occasional swipe on dating apps. It's exhausting, but it's *my* life, you know? Or at least it was, until about 4 months ago when everything started feeling... off.\n\nIt started small. Random likes on old Instagram posts from accounts I didn't recognize – not follows, just silent watches that made my skin crawl. Then, weird DMs that weren't outright threats but felt too personal, like \"Saw you at the park today – cute kid.\" I hadn't posted about the park. I blocked them, chalked it up to paranoia from too many true crime podcasts. But then my phone started glitching: notifications popping up at odd hours, battery draining like crazy even when I wasn't using it, and once, I swear I saw a location ping on my Google Maps that wasn't mine. My computer? Same deal – files opening on their own, browser history with searches I never made (like my ex's name or our old address).\n\nAs a single mom, I don't have the luxury of falling apart. Who would watch my daughter if I spiraled? So I kept it to myself, telling myself I was just stressed, sleep-deprived, imagining things. The last thing I want is to come off as \"that crazy woman\" to my friends or family – the one who's always \"overreacting\" about every little thing. But deep down, I had two suspects gnawing at me: my current boyfriend, who's been pushing for more access to my phone \"to help with the kid stuff,\" or my creepy neighbor across the street, the guy who stares a little too long when I'm loading groceries and once \"jokingly\" asked if I needed help with my WiFi password.\n\nAfter 4 months of this taunting dread – jumping at shadows, double-checking locks, barely sleeping – I finally broke down and paid for an online cyberstalking security audit service. It's called Cyberstalking Security Assessment (shoutout to them – it's remote, affordable, and they scan your devices, accounts, and online footprint without you having to hand over passwords). I was half-expecting it to come back clean, to prove I *was* losing it. But nope. The report hit my inbox 36 hours later: confirmed spyware traces on my phone, a breached email account with unauthorized logins from an unknown IP, and tracking pixels embedded in my social media that were funneling my data somewhere shady. Someone *is* watching me. They even gave me a custom roadmap to clean it all up and lock things down. But the kicker? No clear ID on the stalker. It could be anyone with basic tech skills.\n\nNow I'm freaking out even more. My daughter deserves a mom who's strong, not this shell hiding in her house. Do I go to the police? (They always say \"not enough evidence\" for cyber stuff, right?) Confront my boyfriend and risk him flipping out? Move? Change everything? Or am I still overreacting, and this is just the internet being the internet?\n\nSingle moms (or anyone who's been here), has this happened to you? How did you know it was real, and what did you do next? Ladies dealing with creepy exes or neighbors – tips on staying safe without isolating yourself? And for anyone feeling that same gut-twist of \"am I crazy?\": If you're on the fence, seriously consider a quick security scan. It gave me proof *and* peace (well, the start of it). Link in comments if mods allow.\n\nThrow me your stories, advice, or just a virtual hug. I need to feel less alone in this.",

I tried telling/asking her to be more specific in what does she want to do, when is the trip & whats the occasion (bc i know she has kids so i want to know if theme parks would be good or not, if this is a vacation or more of a short business trip so maybe we could focus more on the downtown area or she would want to see other counties) she kind of dodged answering all of this and basically just wanted me to build her itinerary for the trip?? she also kept asking which hotel she should stay at (but didn’t want to disclose her budget?) but only after i told her the US isn’t like our home country where you don’t have to go to different cities/counties and driving doesn’t take your whole day’s worth, she told me that she’s only gonna be here for a couple of days and no kids. I was already annoyed and felt like i’m being ‘used’ in a way. For context we’re not that close, we don’t talk much, and she just texted me out of the blue to ask about where to go lol. I’m also sort of new-ish to the US, it’s only my first year here (i live in the county but not downtown) and i myself haven’t really go to places that much so it’s not like i’m well versed on this. So i tried to just answer as best as i could, i told her honestly that i haven’t been around that much either so she needs to also look for stuff herself, i even gave her a list of a day trip in downtown. She just sent me a “ooh i see, we should hang out!!” text and then nothing. A few weeks later she texted me and basically asked the same thing so i just copy and pasted my previous answer and she said basically the same thing lmao, not even a thank you.\n\nNow it’s october (the month she said the trip would be) i didn’t hear anything from her but my other friend told me that apparently she’s in the US now (not even in the same state as me at all) so i thought ‘oh ok’ like honestly i’d rather not have her lol. BUT, recently she texted me that she’s coming to my county and wanted to hangout, she told me where her place would be and asked where should we go, so i said ‘idk about that area, so maybe lets meet at X’ (X is a big shopping place in the same city as her place, i don’t drive and i take the bus, so i’d rather go to a place where i’d spend a day bc the bus trip itself is 2 hr one way from my city) The other reason is i thought she’d do the day trip list i gave her so X would be a good final place to go that we could just hangout & have lunch/dinner, i’m also familiar with X so i wouldn’t feel so uncomfortable. BUT THEN, she said “lets just go to your place” lmaooo no ma’am no. So i said, my city is a good drive from yours, it’s not worth it, lets just ‘explore’ your area because there’s nothing in my city. Her response was “no, it’s okay, let’s just go to your place because my flight is a morning flight and my check in is at 2 pm” LMAO made it sound like she’s doing me a favor where she basically just wants to crash at my place. I just told her “let me see my schedule and i’ll let you know”\n\nI’m annoyed because: 1. to me it’s rude to suggest MY place to ME. If the role was reversed, i wouldn’t even say anything about her place because we’re not that close and if she offered it’s nice of her and i probably would say yes but if she didn’t, no big deal. 2. i’m highly ‘protective’ of my space/private person (my husband’s word lol) so i don’t just invite people to my space if i don’t feel comfortable. I don’t see her as someone i’d invite and the way she brought this plan up just made it even worse for me lol. 3. my place is actually being renovated rn, and i’m staying at airbnb but if i tell her this theres a high possibility she’ll just invite herself again to my airbnb ALSO to me telling her this sounded like a lie 💀\n\ni don’t know how to back out without sounding rude tho\n\nsorry for the long post and bad grammar/english.",

But that's less important than the fallout I feel responsible for that's fallen onto my parents. They're both early 70s, but talking to my dad today he asked how I feel about my sister and I both being executor, trustees, and medical POA equally. \n\nI had to tell him that I can't trust her at all. I have no faith in her ability to make decisions or consider anyone beyond herself. She recently told them that she doesn't get the point of spending time with them, like when my dad was in hospital getting both knees replaced. She doesn't get why she was there to support our mom. She doesn't see the point. She and her husband told them not to expect any help with anything. My parents, who financially help them, help them with their kids, live within spitting distance – she made it clear she owes them nothing. I live across the country and spent two weeks after Dad's surgery to help out because we all knew she wouldn't. She doesn't really work, and both kids are older. But it's more about the fact that I feel like shit that now my parents have to figure out their wills and trusts because she's so self-centered I don't have any belief in her ability to make fair choices or be able to make any, really. The money I don't really care about, but I'm not willing to be the bad guy if a hard decision needs to be made. I'm so tired of being immediately related to someone who has zero consideration for anyone outside herself. ",

      "selftext": "This might not make any sense, but I have no one to talk about and just might as well yap online for a bit. But yeah I hate myself even though I've had a pretty good childhood. \n\nI'm not depressed or anything, but I can't ignore how I feel on the inside lately. These feelings that actually have always been there, but I was too busy watching fucking DragonBall on TV instead of paying attention to those feelings lol. I'm a demon when it comes to satisfying my desires, and it's not even funny. \n\n\nWhen it comes to people who matter to me, I know a lot about them. I'd be able to describe them with hundreds of words. But when it comes to myself, I struggle at naming 3 fun facts. Because none of the facts I have are fun. Or maybe because I'm just not used to talking about myself since I'd only feel selfish.. even though it wouldn't be really selfish. So weird.\n\nI'm lazy, incompetent, a liar, manipulative to a certain degree, and an addict of certain media since the age of 11. And the thing that crushes me is that nobody knows about these things. All the people I know have a good image of me in their heads. They think I'm innocent, a saint, the perfect son, the funniest brother, but I'm not. Sometimes, I just sit in my room hoping I'd be caught for all of my sins. That someone would finally hold me accountable for the things I've done and said to people. It sounds a bit corny, but I'm actually super good at lying and deceiving people. I'd be laughing about a 6 7 joke, but deep inside my heart would be burning with resentment.\n\n\nI've always had it good in life, don't get me wrong. Too good, even. My mother raised me and my 2 sisters on her own after my dad left us when I was three years old. There have been a lot of ups, but also a lot of downs. Her relatives always told her that she wouldn't survive on her own with 3 children (And her own sister and my grandmother to take care of.) Her love was unconditional towards us, and she never hit us as punishment. Not even once do I recall being hit with the belt or anything. Always called us her \"blessings\". I just wish she would've beaten some sense into me back when I was a kid so I'd have some discipline.\n\nI yearn for discipline and punishment so much, that I made it a habit to whip my own back with my own belt whenever I did something \"wrong\" since my mom never laid a finger on me. It took me like a month to stop doing it, but as weird as it may sound, I don't regret the scars I have on my back. Makes me feel real. \n\n\nAnd until I was 8 years old, I believed that I was an angel. That I'm enough. I took everything for granted. I've had this sense of superiority over my own mom, this confidence that shouldn't have been there. This feeling that I, truly, was a blessing. But I've never said it. I just felt that way. Me being good at school fueled that ego more and more. My mom never shared a lot about herself, but every few years I'd unlock some new info about her that only fuels my respect for her and my hatred for myself even more. \n\nI wish I could give her the luxury that has been stolen from her by me and my siblings. No, screw that. I wish I could simply lock the fuck in and be good enough at something to make a living out of it. To make a lot of cash, retire her, and buy her a house. I wish I could let her rest and give her everything she needs. I wish I could take her pain and trauma away. But I can't. I'm still in school, vocational school to be exact. I want to start my training next year and make a career. \n\n\nIn the end, I've been spoiled way too much. Not blaming anyone here but myself, of course. I guess I'll always be my own hater, and it doesn't bother me as much as it used to. It's funny to think that any sane person would actually read this post. I dunno you, but I love you man. Lately I've been thinking about how everyone has their own stories, and it's a thought that just kinda warms my heart lol. \"Breaking News: Guy discovers that he's not the only human😱\" ",

      "selftext": "I was planning on updating, as I really need help here. (See my last post)\nTwo nights ago I asked my dad if I could talk to him privately. I was so scared but after the encouragement from my last post I felt confident I was doing the right thing. I was stuttering and nervous, until my dad just patted the seat next to me and said, “[op’s name], let me just be your dad for a minute. What’s going on? What’s wrong?” And I finally spit it out: “Dad, I think you need to fight for full custody.”\nHe looked uncomfortable and said “…it’s too late”\nHUH??\nI was like “what are you talking about??” \nWell apparently, he and my mom had signed the custody agreement THAT MORNING. He told me that they finally drafted papers they could both agree on and signed the paperwork. I was pretty mad. \nBut THEN, he told me that him and his lawyer had written in a clause saying that neither parent can be under the influence of alcohol when in custody of us kids. He explained that that means that while drinking on private property isn’t illegal, directly defying the custody agreement is considered contempt of court and can be penalized by a night in jail and a fine.\nThen my dad said, if I really want him to have full custody of me, I can choose due to my age. BUT, that won’t apply to my siblings and they’ll be at my moms house every other week WITHOUT me. My dad said that it’s my choice, but he’d rather me be there and able to call someone if something happens then my siblings just being alone.\n[For context: \nWhy can’t my sister (12F) call someone? Well, she has been dealing with depression and REFUSES to see a therapist and was also recently diagnosed with ASD. So during my mom’s episodes, she locks herself in her room and shuts everything out. This just leaves my brother(6) alone, unless I’m there.]\n\nSo tldr: cps/police can’t take custody rights from my mom unless she is caught in contempt of court or actively neglecting my siblings and I. In order to prove I am in a dangerous situation, I have to be in a dangerous situation and then it has to be caught. It’s a catch 22. ",

Also I've altered our ages slightly as not to give information on us away as pharma in my country is a small community.\nI (37M) work in pharma and a number of years ago, part of my job was to interact with the QP (Quality Person) (35F) in relation to investigations, reports and the like. \nShe is probably the cleverest individual I had ever met (the first interaction with her was via email and she blew me away) and during the course of the pandemic we got closer and became friends. We chatted often about anything and everything and we enjoyed each others company and over time I had fallen for her. Unfortunately I was a contractor in the company we were in and the job came to an end.\nThen one night, near the end, we went out together and I made a pass on her and I shouldn't have. She didn't ask for it and it killed the friendship. It is one of the biggest regrets of my life. \nSince then life hasn't been the best, I recently was concussed, and the associated depression and brain fog are affecting me, although I have improved in that regard I feel. Relationship wise I'm stuck in a rut and I feel alone. \nAs I write this I am looking at the last gift she gave me, the little book of kalm which always makes me giggle.\nI genuinely just wish I hadn't fucked it up and I just want my friend back.\n\nApologies this is long and rambling, I just needed to get it off my chest. Also this is the first time I've ever written anything like this so that's a plus. \n\nTLDR: Prick fell in love with the QP, made a pass at her she didn't want, now is depressed the friendship is over.\n",

      "selftext": "I had a longtime companion, a 16 year-old cat, who died from kidney disease in May. It broke my heart, I’m fighting hard to stay up when all I want is to stay locked up in my room. She was the reason why I kept going for 16 years, but now I lost her. \nMy family, who usually do not give a flying f about animal loss, allowed me to mourn and respected my space. Some even gave me their condolences.\nHowever, in June, my sister brought two kittens that she found abandoned under heavy rain on a street that usually floods. She couldn’t keep them, she has an Akita. So she brought them to me. I didn’t want them, we have other cats and I was still quite depressed, but I knew that they would’ve died if we let them stay on the streets, so I accepted them. \nIt will be 5 months since they’ve arrived, and only me, my mom and my oldest brother know about them. \nAs they grow older, they’re starting to look exactly like cats we used to have.\nOne looks like a carbon copy of my cat’s mother, who I lost just a bit after my cat was born (that’s one of the reasons why I kept her), and my mom always comments that her heart tightens whenever she looks at the little one, bcs its like seeing my first cat. \nThe other looks exactly like a cat we lost 2 years ago, at 18yo, due to heart failure. Now mind you, all the cats mentioned do not have a breed.\n\nI’m not the one to believe in dreams or anything like that, but a few weeks after they arrived, I had a dream with my 16y.o cat.\nI was crying, saying that I missed her deeply, and she sat on her favorite tree’s branch. She didn’t meow, she didn’t move, she only looked at me with her big blue eyes and blinked once. Then I looked down and saw the kittens running to me. \nNot long after, my brother came to me and said that he too dreamed of her. He said that the dream consisted of our house under construction. He was confused and scared, because the house was down to the foundations. Then he heard a meow, and walked towards the sound. There he found my cat sitting on a small carpet. Again, she didn’t move, didn’t meow again, just blinked. He called for me, to say that she was there, but I was nowhere. When he tried to go looking for me, all he found were the two kittens. Then he tried returning to my cat, but she was no longer there.\nLike my father, my brother is against more animals too. He always says that I should try living without animals for a bit before adopting another. But, strangely, he’s quite affectionate and caring towards the kittens. \nHe too says that they look like the cats we lost and he keeps complimenting their appearance. \nThe biggest problem is only my father.\nThough he is not the type to get physical, he does scream a lot and gets creative when it comes to punishments. I’m scared that someday I’ll get home and he’ll have found out about them. I’m scared that he’ll throw them back on the street or he’ll cease any financial help to my mom. I’m frantically searching for a second job so I can take over if he does that.\nEither way, the kittens are being helpful.\nWhen he’s home, they dont meow nor do they make any fuss. It’s like they dont even exist.\nI’m scared, however, of when they get into heat for the first time… \nI honestly do not know what to do and I dont know if I’ll be able to send them off to a new home. \nFor now, however, I’m just spending my nights looking at them like I’m watching the replay of a movie.\n",

It is 2 AM where I am from and sleep seems to evade me. \n\nThinking back upon my last decade, my 20's, I can say that they were some of the most gruelling years mentally. Having grow up with insane attachment issues and abandonment issues, I craved love vehemently often times from people completely incapable of the same. After back to back verbal, as well as financial abuse, I am here at 30, single.\n\nHowever, there are positive things that happened too. I started with therapy. I can now identify alot of my own toxic traits, I can also identify slowly when my boundaries are crossed. Steadily, I am trying. \n\nI am sure the pro-active, social butterfly, 20-year old me would not have imagined turning 30 in this manner. Mostly alone with people I consider close that I can count on my fingers. Very few people remembering my birthday. I am grown up enough to realise that life gets busy, birthdays are not so important now. \n\nI think it is the child in me that feeds many people's birthdays into my head space to wish them at 12, that gets a tiny bit bittersweet when mine comes. I feel embarrassed to admit that, hehe.\n\nNevertheless, I remind myself that last year, this day, I was crying for someone that meant the world to me, who did not hesitate making me cry on my birthday and today, here I am, having walked out of their life completely a few months back. Learning to leave tables where chairs no longer feel comfortable is  progress, right?\n\nThere are lots of things to be thankful for, I remind myself. My family, a few good friends, the fact that I get to travel, the fact that I reached 30. Yes, life did not go as I thought it would. But when does life?\n\nSo here I am, 30, unmarried, no man in sight for now, but carrying alot of dreams for the coming year and aiming at overall well-being.\n\nThank you, if you reached here!",

Now I’m struggling with loneliness and a sexting addiction that I think started because I’ve been trying to fill that emptiness.\n\nWhen I was younger, I was sexually taken advantage of online, and I think that experience really messed with how I see intimacy and connection.

I'll call the young man Billy and the young woman Sally because I don't feel like writing \"the young ____\" over and over again. \n\nThis is one of those cafes where people sit a while and strike up conversations, not a Starbucks where people are just in and out, so it was situationally appropriate for Billy to see whether Sally was interested in interacting. Sally had also been friendly with other customers already. I think Billy did a good job choosing somebody who'd be open to further interaction. \n\nSo Billy walked over to Sally's table. The poor guy was actually a little wobbly, and his voice was quiet - nearly a whisper - when he asked Sally, \"Is it okay if I sit down?\" She looked up, smiled, and said sure. Billy asked her if she's a student at [local university]. She said yes, and he asked her about her major and how she got interested in it.\n\nThey've talked up a storm about their favorite albums, and now they're talking about economic theory. Billy has lots to say about it, and Sally seems to find him very insightful. \n\nBefore somebody comes in claiming that Billy must be hot as hell, he is not. He's a perfectly average looking young man. But he was brave! And now he's proving himself to be a very interesting person as far as Sally is concerned.\n\nIt's really sweet. I love to see it. I seriously want to slap Billy on the back and tell him he's done a good job. So, so many people in the world would be a lot happier if they followed Billy's lead.",

Over the last two years, I've felt super unwanted, especially romantically and sexually. I'm not a really handsome guy, and I got rejected a lot by girls. There was one instance where I went to the club and got rejected by every girl I approached. That pushed me into inceldom. I am quite ashamed of it, but I was an incel for a long time and only got better during these last months. When I say I was an incel, I mean the whole package, with all the antifeminism and misogynism. It's honestly embarrassing, because at one point I realized how cool the women in my life were, and I also remembered how some girls were romantically interested in me, but it never worked out. I've been going to Therapy for two months now, and it really helps. But sometimes, questions about the future still bother me, mostly romantic questions. Will I have a girlfriend someday? Do I even want one? Those types of questions. Anyway, that's it I guess. ",

And every day i wake up afraid that their household bill debts will catch up and they'll get sued/have their power cut off for good, that he'll kill himself out of desperation, that he'll get conscripted or go to jail for draft dodging, that either or both of his parents will suddenly drop dead from the alcoholism, or 10000 other horrible things.\n\nI think the past year or so i've been subconsciously trying to distance myself from him, so it hurts me less if something horrible does happen.

It's horrible. I frankly don't know what to do. My main prospects are either saving up enough from online odd jobs or finishing my degree and getting a job to finally get him out of there, but both of those will take years from now.

      "selftext": "This is soooooo unoriginal but I’m leaving it here to vent\n\nI want to preface this by saying I don’t even feel like a particularly anxious person. I actually like people. When I’m happier about life I love talking to people and meeting new people\n\nI have family who love and care about me but I feel little connection between us for many reasons. I have few friends and I rarely see them. Don’t feel particularly seen by most of them (maybe all tbh). On the occasions I do socialise I feel amazing. I’m desperate for interaction. Being single sucks but the lack of interaction whatsoever is excruciating. And the long periods without it make you so much worse at it and so much more afraid to even try\n\nI feel confident at home. So sick and tired of being lonely I leave with intention of speaking to someone if I get the chance. I get the chance. I don’t do it. I get home. I feel crap. Repeat\n\nI spend my days stressing about my plans and what I’m doing to get my life together. I’m upset about all the work I’m having to do. And it’s hard. And then I’m doing it all alone. It’s awful\n\nI see strangers I would casually compliment but my mouth doesn’t open. I’ve been improving, I’m at a point where sometimes I nod and some of those nods I don’t have to force which is nice. On a very rare occasion I smile and they smile back. I see people stare at me all the time and I wish they’d approach just for a chat. They must be just as scared as I am\n\nUgh it’s frustrating, I feel like a happy socialite trapped in the body of this miserable unapproachable guy. Spending as much time as possible studying or working on hobbies just for something to do so I don’t develop bad habits or worsen pre existing ones as a result of crappy feelings controlling my behaviour. Just want to be around people man and feel seen and to see others",

      "title": "My friend convinced me to give him a chance, and then ghosted me",
      "selftext": "I’ve been struggling with this for a bit now and I don't know who to talk to about it. \n\nThere’s this guy who’s been my friend for almost 8 years. We became fast friends after working together for 4 years, and even after we both left our jobs, we stayed in touch, hanging out occasionally, going to events or dinners, and talking nearly every day online on different socials.\n\nThroughout our friendship, there’s always been some attraction between us, but we never acted on it. I’m not the type to make the first move, and apparently he just assumed I didn’t find him attractive. Which is ironic because he’d recently been asking me for my opinion on his gym progress, and I told him he looked great 10/10 and didn’t need to change anything.\n\nWe were both somewhat fresh out of relationships. His ended back in April with a girl he called “the one,” and mine was an on-and-off thing that finally ended in June. Around that time, we started hanging out more. I was dealing with something really personal and traumatic, and I opened up to him about it. He also shared stories from his past that he said he’d never told anyone before, not even his ex, apparently. Our hangouts were genuinely special! We’d talk for hours about life, love, and everything in between, and even silence felt comfortable, I really considered him a great friend of mine and I loved to pick his brain.\n\nIn early September, I was dog-sitting for a friend for 10 days and got sick. He showed up with medicine, tea, and snacks. Every night after work, he’d come by, we’d hang out, make dinner, or watch movies. It felt easy, natural. Toward the end of my stay, he sat right beside me on the couch unlike other nights, put his arm around me, and we cuddled through a movie. The whole time, I'm honestly confused and thinking \"Is this platonic? Does he just need physical touch? Does he like me?\". Nothing more happened, but it made me wonder what this was turning into.\n\nAfter that, we started Face Timing almost every night, or he’d come by just to talk in the car for hours. We’d stay parked somewhere for ages, just talking about life, our work, memories, and random things that made us laugh. One night, we were talking about camping, and hammocks somehow came up. He said he had two in his car and could set them up right then and there. I said, “Let’s do it,” kind of jokingly but he actually did.\n\nWe went to a quiet park nearby and found a couple of trees. He pulled out both hammocks but only set up one, saying it would be fine for both of us. I hesitated for a second, mostly worried it would fall with both of us but also thinking of us being that close but got in, and then he climbed in after me. We were pressed against each other, my head was resting on his chest, and we just talked... Every now and then he’d make some teasing comment or I’d laugh, and he’d look down at me in this way that made my stomach flip.\n\nIt became our little thing for a few nights in a row. Each time felt more comfortable, more intimate but still innocent in a way. Then on the third night, we were talking, my head still resting on him, and at one point he tilted my chin up with his hand and kissed me. It wasn’t rushed or planned, just quiet and warm and so natural. We didn’t even talk about it afterward, we just kept lying there, like neither of us wanted to break the moment.\n\nHe called the next day and asked me to dinner. We talked about what happened, and I was honest, I told him I didn’t want to rush into anything because of the thing I told him happened to me recently, and that I really valued our friendship and didn’t want to ruin it for something casual. He told me his intentions were real, that he genuinely liked me, and that he was okay giving me as much time as I needed. He said all the right things, made me feel safe enough to trust him, and eventually, I gave in and let myself really like him.\n\nThe following week felt great! We hung out, talked all the time, and I felt like he truly liked me, I was very happy that everything was going well with him, because I really did think he was a great person and would've been a great partner. \n\nThat weekend on Saturday, he had a first ever half marathon. He made a big deal out of it and joked saying things like, “I need to see you Friday for good luck,” and “seeing you will help me stay determined.” ... Since I couldn’t be there in person, I made him homemade granola bars with a bunch of healthy stuff (because he’s into that stuff) and drew him a little card with a heart running man that said, “You make my heart race.” Inside, I wrote a few sweet (maybe cringy) lines essentially saying I believed in him, and I would say good luck but that he didn't even need it. \n\nOn Friday when I gave it to him, he was speechless and seemed so touched saying things like, “I don’t even know how to react, I don't think I've unlocked this feeling yet\"” and “I wouldn’t expect this even from my wife.” He told me, “If you’re always like this, I’ll have to keep you around.” I was really happy that he was happy and he liked it, I did find his reaction a little weird though. He kissed me, asked me to step out of the car and hugged me, and said next week he wanted to take me on a date.\n\nThen, right after that marathon, everything changed. \n\n  \nHe called after finishing to tell me how it went, but after that, nothing. No messages the rest of the night. None on Sunday. None on Monday until late at night, when he just sent a random Snap of his face. I replied within 5 minutes, but he ignored it. Tuesday, he saw my story but didn’t answer me until much later that night with a very dry message. At this point I felt the energy was super weird and different from before, but I was also trying to be understanding to the fact that he had just run a half marathon, and it could've taken a lot out of him. Wednesday night, he said he “wasn’t trying to ghost” and that he “just had a lot going on,” then asked what I was doing Friday. I said nothing, and he said he wanted to see me. I just replied “okay.” which he didn’t even see until Thursday night.\n\nBy then, the distance was obvious. Our streak ended. He stopped reaching out completely. By Friday afternoon, I removed him from socials, not blocked, just removed, thinking maybe he’d notice and text. But he didn’t.\n\nIt’s been a bit now. No message. No explanation. Nothing.\n\nI completely broke down after it happened. I was crying at work on Friday, trying to keep it together, and it’s just been bad ever since. Some days I feel a bit better, and then I start thinking about everything again and it all hits me like a wave, the confusion, the hurt, the disbelief. I keep asking myself how this even happened. Why did he do this? Why did he treat me better as a friend than as someone he supposedly liked? Why did I embarrass myself by making those stupid granola bars and that cringy card? Did I do too much too soon? I thought I was just being thoughtful. Now I just feel stupid for trusting him and believing the things he said.\n\nI let myself get excited, genuinely happy, for no reason, because apparently, he’s just like every other guy. If he didn’t feel the same way, or if things moved too fast for him, or I gave him the ick, he could have said that. He could’ve at least reached out to explain. He knows me, he knows how I am in relationships. So why would he think that suddenly sending one short message or a random face snap a day was enough? We talked more when we were just friends. I can’t wrap my head around how someone who used to be such a good friend could just switch off like that. And now, weeks later, he still hasn’t reached out. Not a single message. Nothing.\n\nIt makes me wonder if he even noticed that I removed him, or worse, if he noticed and just didn’t care. I can’t stop thinking maybe he just wanted to humble me even more when I was already at a low point in my life. \n\nI don’t even know what lesson I’m supposed to take from all this. I keep trying to convince myself that it says more about him than it does about me, that disappearing on someone who cared, especially after years of friendship and trust, takes a kind of coldness I could never understand. But still, it hurts. I wish I hadn’t given so much of myself to someone who didn’t value it, but at the same time, I know I did nothing wrong by being kind, open, and genuine. I just wish he’d given me the same respect. Right now, I’m just trying to accept that I’ll probably never get the closure I want, and that maybe the only closure I’ll get is knowing that I loved and cared honestly, and that’s something he clearly wasn’t capable of.",

I know everyone thinks everyone is a narcissist these days but my therapist says that while she can’t diagnose him, I definitely have signs of having been emotionally abused for a prolonged period of time. We have kids together so even though we’re split up (paperwork coming soon!) he’s still around a lot. I’m doing some work on the house and of course he had to be here to oversee it because I’m “not the one who knows about these things.”\nToday I’m finding some of the work done in a weird way and I had a realization. I think he’s been intentionally buffering between me and mutuals so that he can make me look difficult and stupid. The worker is a friend. He had started to ask how I wanted something done because a wall wasn’t finished yet, and I started to say “like the others is fine, I just didn’t realize it would be easier for the wall to already be in place.” But my stbx kept talking over me and was like “it’s fine, I’ll tell him what you want, I’ll show him.” So now… it’s wrong. And it’s a mess. And I want to cry even looking at it. My thoughts are swirling because for so long I’ve always had to settle for “well it works so you should be happy.” I just want things done right without looking like a jerk. I’m SO TIRED of “good enough” and “it’ll work I guess.” I’m so angry that I’m only just realizing how my stbx has always been in the middle, and then when things come out wrong he tells me “well this is what you wanted.” I’m tired and I’m angry and I feel stupid and I hate that I want to cry over this stupid electrical outlet that looks SO bad, not because of the electrician but I just want ONE thing to be what I want and not “well it’ll get the job done.” I’m so tired and I’m so angry and I hate that he will always be around because he’s the father of my kids.  And it’s not just this one thing. I feel like this was the dawning moment many years of this. I’m so upset right now. ",

Here where i am its the financial part and in the other is the plant/production and logistics. We were working for them. And I had a very emotionally charged call with a big manager 46M from there. I never ever saw him or talked to him until that point. Neither online or offline.\n\nI had no idea how high on the corporate ladder he was and neither did he know how low i am. It turned out his was the top hierarchy in the other city (production).\n\nI just approached him on email and asked if I can call him (it was a specific task). He treated me badly. Raised his voice (although he agreed to be called) talked over me, belittled me, said I dont understand what he is saying, asked me if I can follow simple tasks and so on. I can agree that I didn't have any solution to his proble, and it was a very old problem. But I was new and was told to take care of it and call him to see what can be done. I would never fall in this trap again. But I wasn't experienced.\n\nSo he raised his voice, was mean and Even asked me if I really think he is stupi d. Because he is not. Lol!\n\nI was intimidated because he was a man, older and had the whole set in profile pic: tie, button up shirt, suit jacket. Uptight and stern. But i was like: ok, stop. Don't talk to me like that.\n\nI doubt someone ever stood up to him. He said he is talking to me politely and I said no you are not. And I do speak politely to you.\n\nWe had a pretty heated conversation. I tried to be calm and also set boundaries. I ended up reporting him to the management from my city and he was called out. One year later i left the company. And we met randomly in a bar. I recognised him and I must have been staring because he also looked at me and then I told him who I am. And he was way friendlier and apologised to me and offered to buy me a drink. He was with his a coworker but that one left. And out of curiosity I had a drink with him and we talked about stuff. And he wanted to keep buying me drinks but it started feeling weird, it was getting close to midnight and I left. What should I think about it? This man acted like he hates me during that call. He was upset with my department (and he was right) but he talked down to me and made me feel so bad about myself. And now he is buying me drinks at the bar.",

      "selftext": "Can't get out of this\n\n\n\nI have been going through a lot of things these days like i went through a break up 9 months ago and it's still haunting me to this day . It all started when I met a girl in my college as she was my  classmate and I didn't know much about her and i didn't even talk with her. But things had changed after the first semester where she approached me and wanted to talk with me and I was just normal . A few months later she became too obsessive with me and I said do you love me and she said yes. She asked for a reply and I told her I need some time and after 1 -2 months i thought a lot and said yes and we were in a relationship. It was very good for 8- 9 months and like one evening she logged in her instagram in my phone and I told her log out and she said i don't  mind . a few months later as she was in the pg . I was in lot of  debts  and she was working part-time and that's when she started ignoring me for no reason. She use to hang out with her friends and tell lies to me . She use to hang out with the new guy friends she meet and  don't even say anything like I'm working or I'm studying don't disturb me . It happened for 3 months and when I confronted her she cried she told I'm a egoistic, controlling man , she wants freedom and I'm not giving it . Like i fought with everyone for her like my best friends from childhood. She use to break up for a few days without any reason and after I request her she use to comeback and this pattern continued for months . I was exhausted, had panic attacks. I saw her chatting with guys and she said they are brothers. Finally after 8 months of this torture like I'm mentally exhausted. I broke up with her and she then flipped the coin and said i used her .    2 months After breakup my friends told me she is with the other guy and like that day we saw that guy and confronted him and suddenly she popped up and started defending him and humiliated me infront of everyone and i was like blank faced . A few months after like a few weeks ago she called me and cried and told everything that she is sorry and she missed me and she doesn't deserve me and I have misunderstood her and the other guy was just her friend . And she said so sorry for taking his side . And at last she was do you still love me ? . She talked for 4 hours . \n\nNote :- she was the one who proposed me. She is the one who wanted me to be protective. She was the one who ignored me , manipulated me , it was a torture being with her . Because of her I can't study i failed in my academics she was with her she wanted to spend time with her . I was caring for her. I did everything I can . At last this is what I got .  In the end she humiliated me , told I'm useless and also told did I ask you to do everything.  She fucking cursed me like i wish you don't deserve a good life ( she did all that I cause i confronted and told her what her toxic behaviour)\n\nNow I'm fucked i don't know like i don't want to go back but I'm not able to move on too   .",

      "selftext": "Im posting this again because I got no replies \nIm really confused \n\nI’m 18, male, and I want to share everything that’s been happening in my life to get it off my chest. My dad is 48, my mom is 43, and my younger sister is 15. Our relationship with my dad hasn’t been good for years. He was fine until 2012, but after that, he started leaving us for months at a time without explanation and verbally abusing my mom whenever he returned. I was only five when this started, and I’ve seen my mom go through so much, carrying all the burden and raising us without a stable home, living in rented places. We’ve struggled financially our whole lives, and that makes everything feel even heavier.\n\nI’ve always wanted to help her as soon as possible. After 10th grade, I took a diploma in mechanical engineering to support her financially. I’m skinny and not strong, partly because I’ve never eaten vegetables and stick to plain food. Despite that, I tried to get jobs to help her. I got selected in a rubber company, but I couldn’t go to Pune, leaving my family behind, and my food habits made it harder too. When I eventually started there, they dumped so much information on me that I cried in front of my mom and asked for a break. She understood, but I still felt guilty.\n\nAfter passing my final year with an 82.5% average, I didn’t know how to find jobs. I ended up going back to the rubber company, but the 10-hour shifts were exhausting and boring. After ten days, I quit. The HR scolded me, called me a disappointment, and I felt so much shame and guilt.\n\nI tried several other jobs after that, but each ended the same way. I joined as a CNC operator, but I couldn’t lift heavy metal blocks, so I left after one day. I went to another company, but the work was completely unrelated to my diploma and felt meaningless, so I left. A misunderstanding with HR there made things worse, and I ended up leaving again. I even tried working in a car showroom as a mechanic. I learned quickly, like changing oil and AC filters, but when it came to lifting tires, I physically couldn’t, so I left. Every time I tried, I wanted to support my family, but my limits kept stopping me.\n\nIn September, something bigger happened. A mysterious WhatsApp group appeared on my mom’s and my phone called “Don’t,” with over 100 members and my dad listed as admin, even though he doesn’t know how to use WhatsApp. My mom tried to warn people and asked them to leave the group. There were misunderstandings with my sister and her van driver, but I called and sorted it out. We also complained to the police about my dad’s phone. A few days later, he called my grandma harshly, claiming we accused him of sending dirty messages to my sister, which wasn’t true.\n\nOn October 5th, while I was home alone, he suddenly appeared, started gathering his things, and called me names like “hijra,” berating me and saying I’ll never be successful. He threatened that he would wait for my mom to come home and take money from her. My sister arrived, and he started destroying things, hitting his phone on the table, crying, and blaming us for accusing him of something he didn’t do. He threatened suicide to get me in trouble, and when my mom came home, he fought with her. After he finally left, we settled down at home, and my mom noticed some of her prayer photos in the trash the glass shattered. She was devastated because she has so much faith in them, and seeing them destroyed hurt her deeply.\n\nAfter all this, he left, and we don’t know where he is. I also tried the mechanic job on October 6th, but couldn’t lift tires after everything that had happened, so I left again. Today, October 10th, my mom expressed disappointment that I’m not taking steps to get a job, and it hurt me deeply. I’m already filled with guilt and shame and don’t know what to do or how to move forward.\n\nI’ve tried everything. I’ve left multiple jobs, faced abuse from my dad, seen my mom hurt, and still feel like I’m failing. I want to support my family, but I feel stuck, lost, and exhausted. Financial struggles make everything worse because I feel the pressure to provide and fix things immediately, but I don’t know how. I don’t know how to start over or what kind of job will fit my skills and limitations, and it’s tearing me apart emotionally.\n\nIf you read the whole thing please let me know what should I do 🙏",

The thing is, he is extremely jealous, that’s the only thing I would change from him, and honestly it gets me tired. I don’t like partying, I don’t have friends as I moved from my hometown, I never go out by myself, I don’t even dress with anything that shows, I don’t text with anyone, like literally I have zero reasons for him to believe I would cheat on him, he has gotten to a point where Im afraid to talk or be around man because anything can trigger him, and he would blame me of trying to seduce man, example: I was at my nieces birthday party, I was next to him dancing by myself and he got super mad because he said I was dancing for other man, literally no one was around me. Any situation triggers him, Im always walking on eggshells when we are at a party, reunion, or when people is around. The only time I feel calm is when I am at home and there is no one else. He even hates that I love an artist that is already dead, I cant listen to his songs. I stopped communication with my kids dad to avoid problems, I let him talk to him. There is nothing I can do and I can’t leave my man for one single defect if everything about him is amazing, any other man would have other defect. I just wish he can see I really love him and I have no intention to cheat on him, and I never gave him a reason to doubt.",

      "selftext": "I 34m want to type it down so that I can work it out and understand it.\n\nIt's been an on again off again relationship for the past 7 years. She 41f is my coworker, and will continue to be until one of us retires, which is a long way down the line. We had been coworkers for a month or so, both of us began to work there at the same time.\n\nShe approached me. At the time I had just gotten out of a relation and she asked me to be F Buddies. She explained that she was in a relationship and had a fiancé. She even wore her engagement ring daily, even when she was with me. Problem was, her fiancé didn't want to have sex with her. And, I found out later on, I was not the first one she cheated on him with. It was not an open relationship, the fiancé didn't know she was hooking up with me, even though the signs where pretty damn clear.\n\nAfter a few months of being friends with benefits, I ended things with her to pursue a romance with another woman in a serious relationship. But it didn't turn out as expected and I ended it a couple months later when we found out of the unplanned pregnancy. I was devoted to being a dad even though I wasn't in a relationship with the mother and I came back to my coworker to resume our F Buddies deal. But, a few months later, we developed feelings for each other.\n\nI, again, broke things off with my coworker because I wanted something serious and she still was with her fiancé. A few months later, she reached out to me saying she wanted to be with me and would end things with her fiancé. We broke up again a few months later because she just couldn't do it. She looked for me again when she finally did, but kept in touch with him and went out with him, so I broke up with her again.\n\nShe again looked for me to be F Buddies and I accepted but told her I wanted more, that I was in love with her. She reciprocated, but it has been difficult because she gets angry with me for being present in my daughter's life. Once we even broke up because she was angry that I wanted to give my daughter a gift while we were going to spend the weekend together. I asked her that time not to look for me anymore, but she did. We got back together but I blocked her when we were having problems again about not spending time together because I was raising my child.\n\nShe looked for me again this year and I agreed to go out with her. She even let me stay at her house. She, btw, has two sons from a previous relationship, before even the fiancé she was cheating on, and they live with her. Her mother helped her out to raise the grandchildren and has been living with her to this day. The sons are now adults, 19 and 21, and they have almost no relationship with her. She sometimes doesn't see one of them for like weeks, the young one.\n\nShe broke up with me because she doesn't like that I listen to her and that I've told her that some things she has said to me have hurt me. I was begging for a compliment for the past week, like, I like your eyes, or I like your hair, or something, and she got mad at me because she said I have put on a few pounds and that I am no longer attractive to her and I shouldn't be asking her again so much because she already said that to me a couple of weeks prior.\n\nShe spends a lot of her time with radical causes, like feminism, socialism, political manifestations and free-palestine rallies and the sort. When she's at home, with her mom, her tone of voice changes drastically to an upset tone and she becomes monosyllabical around her. We once had a huge fight because I told her I could see her underwear because she likes to wear really short A-line skirts and I wanted her to reserve that intimacy for me. She was really angry and accused me of wanting to control her and asked me how I dared ask that from her when she has been on abusive relationships in the past.\n\nJust writing all this is a little exhausting and makes me see myself as someone who has endured a lot of hardship. I must say about me that I am no saint, I have BPD, but I'm dealing with it with therapies and meditation and an on going self reflection on my emotions. Violence has never been present in my character, but depression, low self-esteem and suicidal ideologies have rounded my head since I was a teenager and increased when I became an unplanned parent.\n\nI don't want relationship advice, I just want a clarity of mind and remind myself that I am worthy of having a partner that wants to be with me and is not angry at me for trying to voice my concerns or feelings in a polite and not hostile way.\n\nThanks for reading this far. I just needed to get this off my chest.",

I was just a kid, so I replied politely...\nHe followed me on Instagram, and somehow, he even knew the new house we were moving to...\nThen, he sent me a housewarming gift. I thanked him, asked how he knew my location… and he never replied. That was it. We lost touch.\n\nFast forward a couple of years,,, he calls me, saying he was getting into politics and wants me to be his legal advisor when I graduate. I laughed it off, thinking he was joking. But over the years, he’d occasionally text me with… weird legal questions about illegal stuff he was doing... gold bars, trucks of sand, all kinds of shady things. Like, legit pictures of them...\nI was scared, but I didn’t feel like I was in danger, and I was a law student, so I figured I could handle myself.\n\nAnd now… it’s 2025. I’ve graduated, started practicing, and I get assigned a new client...\nI glance at the name and something clicks. During the meeting… it hits me. It’s him!! The same guy!! My stalker from seven years ago.\n\nHe didn’t freak out. He didn’t pretend we were strangers. He just sat there, explained his problem, and left, casually handing me his card. I’m shaking. I was terried!\nThis is the same person who has been hovering in my life since I was a child, since i was like 16 years old and now I’m supposed to help him as his lawyer... \n\nI don’t even know who to tell this to. Part of me feels like I should run away, but part of me knows I can’t. I just… I can’t process that this is real life... \n\nAs a professional i learnt from my seniors that you always see your client as a client and you have to represent them no matter what, which i get it, I am pretending the same but I cant forget this whole incident and its scary.",

      "selftext": "I'm 23 now. Throughout college, and since graduating, I've come to realise how little I was taught growing up. My parents loved me, and still do, but they skipped a lot in the teaching of basic life skills. I've now recently come to realise that my parents couldn't teach me much, because they don't know an awful lot themselves. \n\nI've had to teach myself a lot of things, as the eldest child from a working class family, the first with a degree and the first to be navigating working at a company. From hygiene, to social skills, to driving and mental health. I can't think of much at all that my parents actually taught me themselves. But, much of what they do know, they also failed to pass down.\n\nI don't want to hold any resentment towards them, but sometimes I do. When I realise just how much people actually learn from their parents, and the amount of hand holding they get through life, it can be hard not to compare. \n\nDespite this, I know my parents broke a lot of generational trends, and have done so much more than what their parents did for them. I love them for that. \n\nIt's difficult and frustrating to navigate at this point in my life. Feeling like I'm playing catch up to other people my age who were taught what they need to know to navigate life. I think I've done quite well on my own and would still consider myself lucky. I've actually done really well with what I have. I'm really grateful.",

      "selftext": "My grandma \"Sue\" (70sF) was diagnosed with terminal cancer 2 years ago. She also suffers from Alzheimer's, which we knew was going on for around the same time frame as the cancer but only got noticeable enough to be diagnosed last year.\n\nShe's always been horribly stubborn and judgmental, on top of being abusive to my mom (her only child, 50sF) and caustic as hell to me (25F) when I was growing up. She's always refused to admit any limitations or accept when she needs help, and thinks it a weakness in others when they do.\n\nThese traits in combination with her recent cognitive decline, her living across the country from us, and the fact she'd isolated virtually every other family member over the years has made our lives a living hell for the last two years.\n\nSome lowlights:\n\n* Initially refused to acknowledge her terminal diagnosis and kept claiming over the phone that her oncologist said she'd recover fully in short order. My mom had to start flying cross-country 1-3 times a month and take Sue to appts herself just so we could know what was actually going on. (Which put a huge strain on her job and on the family finances.)\n* Despite having to take over care of her own awful mother with Alzheimer's a decade ago and always complaining bitterly about how ill-prepared my great-grandma was, we found out after her cognition started deteriorating that Sue had made *zero* plans in case of illness or decline. No advance directive, not even a will. Then she argued nonstop against my mom's attempts to help her set those up for > a year, and accused us of trying to steal her money.\n* Last year, Sue took a bad fall in her home that left her wheelchair-bound, at which point my mom miraculously managed to convince her to move closer to us so we could be there for her more easily. My mom was adamant about caring for her personally (despite her & my dad both working full-time and my brother being a hands-off golden child) so they moved Sue into the family home with the three of them (I have my own place) and guilted me into coming over to babysit her every day while they all did their own thing.\n* Once there, Sue denied that there was anything wrong with her, *again,* and started really nasty fights over us trying to help her get around. Two weeks in, my dad made the stupid mistake of letting her go to the (hard tile floor!!!!) bathroom by herself, and Sue promptly fell again and broke her pelvis. This has left her bed-bound ever since, and my mom moved her into an assisted living facility with actually licensed carers, close enough that we can all visit regularly.\n\nThese days, Sue is barely there mentally. She's frequently in & out of the hospital with infections. It's sad and truly painful to see my grandma suffer and struggle, knowing how proud and independent she's always been.\n\nBut the shameful part is, I'm also **pissed the hell off** that her pigheaded stubbornness and lack of foresight or empathy, and the damage she's done to my mom as a person, has gotten me re-enmeshed in my family's mess.\n\nMy mom has mellowed out a lot since finally starting therapy, but she used to be a fucking *terror* to me, physically, verbally, and emotionally. Truly her mother's daughter. I've always existed to be her unpaid therapist and punching bag: I'm her AuDHD, parentified, depressed, queer embarrassment of a daughter whose disability needs are always put second to her and my brothers' instabilities.\n\nDuring the pandemic, I took the opportunity to really distance myself from my family, set real boundaries, and try to live independently while managing my disabilities. It was bliss. I quit drinking, I started working in a field I love. I was really feeling good about becoming more independent.\n\nBut when Sue fell, my mom begged me to come with her \"just this once\" and help assess my grandma's mental & physical condition, and because it was a serious scare, I agreed to help \"just until they got her settled in\". Which is like saying you're just going to take one step onto the water slide.\n\nNow guess who's guilted into giving up their life to sit all day every day for a week at a time and get info from the doctors while Sue berates me, *every time* she goes to the hospital? (Which is *every month* thanks to my mom's anxieties, regardless of whether it's truly an emergency.) Not my mother! Not my dad, who tells me I don't *have* to help but never stops my mom from beating me over the head about faaaamily, and never lifts a finger unless my mother points it for him! Not my brother either, who gets to have a job and a college career and free time and free room-and-board and full emotional + financial support, all totally unimpeded by the needs of others!\n\nIt's me, because I'm the fucking girl. I'm the oldest. I'm the extra parent. I'm the only other person in the family who's even remotely willing to help. I'm an extension of my mom in my grandma's eyes and a convenient nursemaid in my mom's.\n\nI've struggled *hard* over the years to break free of that fucking cycle and I was doing SO FUCKING WELL, yet here I am again being guilt-tripped into subservience to my family, not allowed to have a life of my own. My soul pet died recently and I'm just expected to suck it up and be there for the family. I'm so alone and sad and I've had to give up multiple job interviews because my grandma's back in the hospital again, and I'm watching her die slowly not knowing who I am, and I'm terrified that it's going to happen to me, and *none* of my family cares because they're just relieved it isn't all on them. The emotional labor never stops, and it never will.\n\nI feel like a truly terrible person but I hate Sue for building this cycle and keeping me trapped in it when I thought I'd finally gotten out. I wish her suffering would come to an end and my mom would leave me alone. I'm an adult in my own apartment and I still feel like I want nothing more than to just run away from home.",

      "selftext": "Look so my girlfriend told me she’s already made a whole bunch of essays about me on here so I just thought maybe I should tell my side of the story.\n\nI am 16M and my girlfriend is 15W. So one day my Mum picked me up to take me to my gfs house at like 10 am. Previously, she’s always been complaining about the limited time my Mum lets me spend time with her so I begged my Mum this time to let me go to her house. So I just got to the house and hugged and kissed her cheek upon arrival. She looked a little under the weather but I didn’t pay too much attention to it. I went upstairs and she laid on the bed and smiled at me. I took my shirt off giddily wanting to make love to her only for her to quickly utter the words “I’m pregnant”. I was COMPLETELY bamboozled and didn’t know what to say. “You’re what?”\n“I’m pregnant.” I told her how this better not be one of her pregnancy scares. We’ve had two. I think she’s said on here that I threatened to leave her during them times and to be honest yeah I did. I was dumb and 14 the first time she came with that and once again dumb the second time but instead 15. Anyways, she said it’s not a pregnancy scare and she took a test back in June. I couldn’t believe what I was hearing and the fact she took so long to not tell me this. I got up and was crying with my head in my hands because I didn’t know wtf to do. My family will most definitely disown me if they knew what I did. She keeps bringing up the fact my mum was 17 when she had me. My mum was raped and had to go through a lot to look after me. I have six siblings. She simply will hate me for making the mistake that throughout my life she has told me not to do. I was pretty much disowned at 14 when my Mum was sick of me sneaking out of the house with my friends or how she went through my phone and saw my notes app and how I had written all the names of the girls I had been with. It was 103 different names. I had to sit on the streets for three days not eating or drinking. If I got this news out to my family, this could be permanent even. So for the past few weeks it’s been arguments back and forth about how I should tell my family and make an effort to be a parent. To be honest, I don’t really want to be a parent deep down. I’m scared that this makes me a bad, disgusting horrible stupid fucking person. Look okay I’m sorry. But I am busy all day, All I do is work, go to college, go to the gym and do more work. It’s exhausting. I don’t know how Im gonna add this massive thing to my schedule about a baby! I hate arguments. I have a lot of trauma of arguments in my past so I to make her stop I agreed and said “Ok I’ll work my ass of to financially support the baby. I just am not ready to let my family know of the news. On the other hand, I feel terrible turning my back on my actual baby. I couldn’t sleep at night. My dad did it with me. I’m not my dad. So like I said I will do my best to do anything I can for the baby. I want to be a good person.",

      "selftext": "My(28F) romantic life is terrible. I’ve had partners of all kinds. Partners who didn’t contribute or cared as much as I did. Partners who lead me on and used me just for their own selfgratification. Even one that cheated on me.\n\nAll in all, I started to believe I was unlovable.\n\nJokingly, I left my number for a guy at a restaurant. My friends and I drunkenly started looking at bumble to see if he was there. This was on vacation (not shocking, he wasn’t on the dating app)\n\nWe went home and I don’t know why I kept the app downloaded. I swiped through some people and ended up getting a few matches. One of them was completely different. He (26M) had all the same interests I had, wonderful smile, and he actually knew a mutual friend of mine. I started talking to him.\n\nIt was wonderful. He really took the time to know me. I have bipolar disorder (which maybe that contributed to my love life before) and he watched videos educating himself on the disorder. He wanted to make sure I ate and took my meds on time. We had fun dates like going to the state fair and he won me a prize. He’s also really good in bed.\n\nUnfortunately, he’s not an American citizen. He’s on an H1B visa. That’s not a huge deal for me but it became a problem when he was laid off from his job. The issue is that he has only so many days to stay here in the US to find another job. With other factors contributing to the difficulty of finding a sponsorship, it was extremely stressful for him. I was there for him and he was grateful for that saying that my company brought him joy on his stressful days.\n\nThen the universe decided to play a sick joke. His dad got sick with cancer. They caught it early thankfully but that doesn’t stop the road of recovery being a long and hard one.\n\nEverything is leading him to the decision to go back to his home country which I fully support. We weren’t official and I didn’t want to tie him down. He wasn’t able to see his grandfather before he passed because of COVID and other immigration issues which was really upsetting. I didn’t want him to face the same thing with his father.\n\nSo he’s going back. We don’t like long distance relationships because we’ve both had bad experiences with them before. I don’t know if he’ll ever return. If he does return to the US, it probably would be in a city I don’t live in. So I, most likely, will never see him again.\n\nI’m heartbroken and devastated which makes me feel selfish because I don’t want to be a factor in this decision. He needs to go and I support it. I feel like the universe is against me.\n\nAll my friends tell me “oh there’s other fish out there” but I don’t want them. I want him and see us having a future together. Which was ripped away from me by the universe.\n\nI just wanted a place to talk and say all of this out loud. With my frustration with my love life. Because it seems like in the end, I feel worthless and unloved. If you read this, thank you 🥺\n\nTl;dr: my current relationship is being ruined by him losing his job and having to move back to his home country",

Literally kicking her feet like a toddler. My friend and I gave her the nickname Chucky. So recently she’s been skipping all her classes with this other girl Martyna just for them to talk about me and my friend. They say things like I’m a slut, I’m pregnant, I’m a whore and all of these nasty things. Martyna talks a lot about my friend because there is beef because they used to be best friends but she got together with my friends ex and was being weird messaging her asking, “how good is your ex in bed?” So what me and my friend did is we talked to all their friends and told them about how they are bad people. They literally told everyone about the shit they said about us. I just told them that they will talk shit about you too and they are not genuine friends. As a result, Martyna has completely dropped out of college. My friend told her that she should come to college and talk about it to her but Martyna is shit scared that she thinks she’s going to have a fight. We also confronted Latisha when she was walking down the stairs and I asked her about why she is talking shit about me and how I literally don’t know her. She told me that it wasn’t her and that it was the boy next to her talking shit. And I was like oh so there’s a boy called Latisha? You were clearly the one talking so stop right now, it’s not cute, the glaring makes me think you wanna eat me and you should say things to my face instead. The guy next to her was asking if we were following them but we are literally going to the next lesson. We are in the same course. 💀",

We’ve been together since high school when we were just 16. It’s been 11 years now. Our relationship hasn’t been perfect. We’ve broken up a few times, but it never lasted long, maybe 2 months, the longest was 7. No matter what happened, we always found our way back to each other.\n\nIn 2020, I got pregnant and we decided to get married. But two months before our wedding, while I was on bed rest because my doctor said I was at risk of miscarriage, I saw a message on his phone. It said, “I want to spend time with you one last time before I get married.” I didn’t know what to do. My parents had turned their backs on me after finding out I was pregnant, and at that time, he was the only person I had. I showed his family the message, but they said nothing. No one stood up for me. I guess that’s just how it is, no matter what their son or brother does, they’ll always take his side.\n\nAnd I know you might ask, “Why did you still stay?” The truth is, he begged me to. And I stayed because I felt like I had no one else, nowhere else to go. It was during the pandemic, and I thought the only thing I could do was endure it, for the sake of our child.\n\nThen in 2021, I gave birth. That’s when life really started to test us financially, emotionally, and mentally. I tested positive for COVID on the day I was supposed to deliver our baby. Because of that, our hospital bill tripled and our baby had to stay in the hospital for monitoring. My husband and I had to isolate, and that’s when everything came crashing down.\n\nWhile we were in isolation, he suddenly confessed. He said he couldn’t handle the guilt anymore. He admitted that before we got married, he had sex with different women, three in total, according to him. But honestly, I doubt that was the whole truth. He also mentioned another woman he used to constantly text, someone he got close with but didn’t “do anything” with, or so he says.\n\nI was speechless. I had just given birth, our baby was in the hospital, and I was trying to stay strong. But inside, I was breaking. It felt so unfair that he chose that moment, when I was at my weakest and had no one to talk to, to confess everything.\n\nHe tried to justify it by saying that I also “cheated” once, but mine happened when we were broken up. I even confessed it to him when we got back together. He said he forgave me, but every time we fought, he’d bring it up again, like he never really moved on from it. For years, he made me feel like I was the only one who did wrong as if I was the one who ruined us, when in reality, what he did was so much worse.\n\nAnd when I think about it now, it actually makes sense why he said he was “okay” with what I did before, because deep down, he knew his actions were far worse. He even told me once that maybe what I did was just karma for what he did to me. Maybe that’s why he accepted it so easily, because he knew he deserved it.\n\nHe told me it’s all in the past and that I should just accept it since we’re already married and have a child. But deep inside, I still can’t fully forgive or forget. It’s been years but the pain still lingers. Sometimes I look at him and I remember everything he did, everything he hid from me until I had no choice but to accept it.\n\nAfter that, I stopped checking his phone. If he decides to cheat again, that’s on him. He already has a daughter. If he doesn’t have the conscience to stay loyal to me, then it’s up to him whether he can live with doing that to his own child. But if he ever repeats it again, that will be my final string. He will lose every right to us.\n\nNow, I’ve learned my lesson. After giving birth, I pushed myself to find work and build something for myself. I have my own job, my own money, and my own strength now. I don’t have to endure the same pain again just because I have nowhere else to go.\n\nDespite everything, he’s actually a good father to our daughter. He provides for her and spends time with her. She adores him so much because he loves playing with her and being present in her life. And for that, I’m thankful.\n\nMaybe I’ve already forgiven him in some ways, but not completely. The pain just turned into acceptance. I’m not the same person I was before. If ever history repeats itself, I know this time, I’ll choose myself.\n\nThank you for reading this far. I just needed to let this out.",

She calls me a liar then she told me I'm \"mentally f**ked,\" that I'm an \"embarrassment\" and \"the worst child anyone could ask for.\" (I would disagree, I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't party, I get all As and Bs, I have a job, read and write in my free time, have never received a negative at school etc). \n\nIf there's one thing of many that I have on my mum it's that I'm way better with words than she is and I don't have to call her things based on her physical appearance to upset her (I left those out coz tmi)\n\nSo I told her she was a bad parent and that everything she complains about me or my brother doing is her fault which of course was mean and of course caused more yelling. \n\nWe had an argument and she insisted I was wrong and I said she's wrong. She thinks I'm lying I think she's confused or mistaken yet she kept calling me a liar and said \"oh so I'm a liar\" and I was like no...never bloody said that did I?\nShe called me an embarrassment, a disgusting child etc etc, the usual.

I don't want to move out and go far away and I don't even know if I wanna do a degree or whatever - I'm in my desired field and it doesn't require one. She only wants me to go so she doesn't have to see me, she wants me out of her house as soon as possible. I don't want to see her either, but I'm too emotional to live on my own.\n\nPs: sorry for the lack of punctuation I'm in a rush\n  ",

I never questioned why my mom would tell me not to bring him up around my step-dad. She just said it was because it'd make him sad, and I never wanted to make my dad sad so I never talked about my bio dad around him. \n\nI never understood why the one time I was under his care for a few hours, my siblings (my half siblings from his side) immediately took me to their room to play and I couldn't spend quality time with my dad.\n\nI never understood why he suddenly just stopped visiting one day.\n\nI understood as a child why, because like old habits he abandoned me again without a word and my mom finally came clean.\n\nI learned what a piece of shit he was and why my dad got sad when he was brought up. He didn't just get sad he got angry, because he was their before and when I was born.\n\nHe put his name on my birth certificate and adopted me and my older brother just so he couldn't be told we weren't his kids.

She wanted us to get what she couldn't have. Though it ultimately backfired since unfortunately both of our biological dads weren't that great of poeple.\n\nAnd whenever I think of my biological dad, or something reminds me of him. I don't feel or think anything of him. I no longer care about him. Though their js still a part that resents him.\n\nAnd I just know, i won't be sad if he passes on. I haven't seen him since i was around 12 and I hardly remember certain things about him. I remember how he looked but thats it. I no longer remember how he sounded, nor what kind of personality he had when around me or my mom.\n\nI just can't bother thinking or wishing that he was apart of my life. Even for my achievements, I don't care anymore.\n\nHes never shown up before, why would he show up now.\n\nAnd besides, I have a dad. My step-dad who literally had no reason to be in my life or become my dad. He chose to, and even without blood bonds. He'll be me and my brother dad, hes always been their for us",

I come home from college and classes tired, exhausted and wake up as a cheery guy but \"home\". Can't ever vent at home about any college incidents or anything. Always the replies are \"do this, do that\" from parents or some taunts, some blame shifting on me, then always the sad face on seeing me just because they can't get over a fight that happened between me and them over 3 days ago. My mother is a good person, helpful, and understanding, but sometimes does gaslighting too. Emotional gaslighting that too. I'm quick to realise gaslighting and can immediately realise it happening to me. Makes me depressed. Why can't they ever listen to something without ever giving advice or directions or smth? Mind it that I have tried communicating this several times, but it didn't work and I think never will. I can't ever clearly communicate problems without them blaming, crying, or something random. Can't exactly put 100% of the fault on them. My fault too that I am stubborn and highly debative person. I can't stand certain behaviours like controlling, threatening etc. and mother's highly charged and emotional words along with my father's lectures almost 2 hours after the argument has ended with him saying \"I don't want ro lecture you right now, but your behaviour is unacceptable\" and goes on to give a lecture. every request or every rant or every opinion at home comes with \"yes, but\" which neither is a yes nor a no. I have strong opinions about beliefs and whatnot and they get highly combative whenever I put forward those opinions. \n Can't even blame them because my home is not like other homes where the parents are abusive or something. My parents care for me, support my dreams but what can I call this? Emotionally toxic?\n\nI just wanted to get this off my chest. It has been pestering me since long.",

      "selftext": "Right now I’m at a really weird place in my life, and this will be a long post, so thank you if you read it to the end.\n\nI’m a 25yo male from Europe. Since I was a kid, I knew I wanted to be in the film industry. I went to high school for media and later to college for visual arts and marketing. I gained real-world experience in video production, mostly on film sets for commercials, music videos, and corporate projects. Later, I also started working as a video editor, so I have strong experience in both on-set and post-production work.\n\nAfter a few years, I realized the work environment was draining me. Mainly because of an unhealthy relationship with my boss. He gave special treatment to others, and I often felt unimportant when it came to planning work. Filming schedules were unpredictable, and I was always on call, which meant no personal time. I stopped making plans with friends because I always had to cancel last minute.\n\nI noticed my boss discussing upcoming projects with others weeks in advance, while I’d find out only a couple of days before filming (sometimes 12hours before lol). When I confronted him, he’d always say, “That’s just how this industry works.” I was his only camera assistant, and even though he relied on me, the pay wasn’t fair. I did most of the work: focus pulling, lens changes, moving gear, even recording sound while pulling focus!!(thats really not how things should be done on sets hahah) Or helping with drone shots. Eventually, I burned out and left to work a stable store job just to have predictable hours and a regular paycheck.\n\nFast forward a year later, I had saved a good amount of money, and I decided to marry my girlfriend, who lives on the other side of the world (South East Asia). We’d been together for three years and met in person before. I quit my job, sold my car, and bought a one-way ticket to SEA. I arrived five months ago, married the love of my life, and for a while, things were great.\n\nI still had some part-time editing jobs from my old production contacts, and my savings were enough for about a year of living here (or so I thought). But after a month, those editing jobs stopped due to internal issues on their end. My confidence backfired. I had set our rent a bit too high, thinking I could easily keep up. Suddenly, my savings were draining fast and I had no new income.\n\nI told myself not to panic, I will find work. But here’s where it got tough. For the past four months, I’ve been constantly applying for editing gigs, sending my portfolio to potential clients, reaching out on LinkedIn, Reddit, and freelance platforms. I feel like I’m doing everything I can, but nothing works. Either I get ghosted after trial edits or offered unrealistic workloads for pay that’s low even by SEA standards.\n\nI know I have the skills, but I just can’t seem to find anyone who sees that in me or gives me a chance. Out of desperation, I started applying for any online work I could do: data entry, virtual assistant, design, social media… But still nothing. It’s been months of constant effort and false hope. I send at least ten messages a day, but I’m burning out and losing motivation.\n\nMoney is getting tight. We had to move to a cheaper apartment. We dont really go out, we dont travel (we agreed we will do that once we are together), we dont live luxury life, we dont have car or motor… My wife works and covers bills and food, but her salary isn’t high. She’s been incredibly supportive, but I can see it’s weighing on her too. I feel like a burden financially, and it breaks me to think I might reach the point where she has to carry everything.\n\nLegally, I can’t take local work yet because of my visa. I am still on tourist visa, trying to convert it to spouse visa. And that’s another stress… Every office says something different, and things keep getting delayed. I try to get all the papers but it is keep on going and going. I probably have about five months of savings left, but I’m already panicking. I also need to show proof of finances for my visa, which adds even more pressure.\n\nI want to focus on the good things but i just cant. I want to enjoy our marriage, our life together…But it’s hard when I feel like I’m failing at providing and building a future for us.\n\nThat’s all. I just needed to let it out.

He was the first person I truly loved, and because of that, I don’t really know any other way to love.\n\nMy heart seems wired to fall for people who won’t stay, to hope for love after something temporary, even when I know how it ends.\n\nI am a hopeless romantic and I still believe in love, but It feels unreachable.\n\nI turn 18 in a few months, and I still carry all of this with me.\n\nIm in desperate need of advice…",

He liquid shits everywhere. I mean like spray farts shit just sitting on the couch sometimes. One prescription food kinda helps but not enough to make him tolerable to live with. He has to stay in the bathroom at night and I got so tired of scrubbing shit with bleach every day that I started tapping down potty pads. Well now he thinks he can pee on the potty pads/bathroom floor and he scratches through them after peeing. \n\nTomorrow morning I will have to wake up 45 minutes early just to scrub the entire bathroom before getting to shower. I feel disgusting every time I walk into the bathroom. I avoid showering and only shower every 2-3 days because of how much work it is to get the bathroom clean enough to actually feel clean. I’m so tired of randomly finding shit in my apartment. It’s a tiny 1 bedroom and it smells awful from the bathroom even though it is deep cleaned so much. \n\nI’m sure if I had unlimited money for advanced testing a solution maybe would’ve been found by now but I’m in credit card debt just from the somewhat basic tests he’s had done. I hate him. I hate looking at him. All he does is cry and shit. He’ll stare at me crying then sit there and push for 5 seconds before shitting on the floor when he could’ve at least tried to make it to the litter box. On the rare occasion that he shits in the box he doesn’t even bury it so I still have to smell it until I’m able to cover it with litter. He has completely ruined my life. I can’t have friends over. I can’t travel because I can’t afford to pay a pet sitter enough to put up with him. Nobody would want him if I tried to rehome him because on top of this he doesn’t even snuggle or do anything cute. I can’t bring myself to put him down over a non serious illness. I wish he would just die. ",

She told them I needed mental health treatment yet, here's the fucking kicker! She suggested it because I had a delayed circadian rhythm(which I've mostly fixed as autism says fuck you to melatonin). Not the depression two non-psychologists(her and another doctor who was ALSO a problem) said I have (I'm just autistic and traumatized, y'all.

Then my best friend texted me they got reservations for two to this fancy place in the city for Monday and to wear that dress I bought not too long ago. They’d told me they’d wear a suit. They’re covering the full thing. And I just forgot I was upset.\n\nAnd now I’m upset, just loathing again. And I just, idk I’ve been either loathing, getting high, drinking, or zoning out lately when I feel the slightest bit upset when I’m at home and it sucks. I’m tryna save for an apartment with my best friend, I should be focused on that. But I can’t even focus on my classwork or like filling out more job applications without randomly bursting into tears.\n\nI literally keep looking up plastic surgery prices and I’m a mess. I know I should go to therapy but I’m skittish about therapy due to past issue within my mental health care. And at the end of the day I feel like a hopeless case. I’ve had people with horrendous lives tell me they were shocked I was still alive at 22. A lot of people have told me that they wouldn’t be strong enough to be still standing or not like real life villains in my place.\n\nFurthermore, my self esteem about my physical looks are in the toilet. I’m thin, but not model thin, I kinda look like a guy. I’m tall, I’m flat chested, and I have broad shoulders. I don’t wanna look like super masculine body wise even in my dress, but lately I’ve felt that way. :(\n\nThe only thing that brings me real joy are my friends, especially my best friend.

I keep a photo of my best friend by my bed, and they keep one of me in their wallet.\n\nBut honestly, I’m just worried with how bad I feel physically, how purely hideous I feel, I’m gonna look ridiculous in that dress. I don’t want to ruin a night at a place my friend has been wanting us to go to since March. I’m so insecure and that’s such a major reason for my depression.

      "title": "Final Update: I’m secretly in love with my best friend and yesterday he introduced me as his sister.",
      "selftext": "Okay so I wasn’t going to make another update but I feel like we’re on this journey together now. I’m not sure how to link previous posts but they’re on my profile. The TLDR I’m in love with my best friend but he introduced me to his coworkers as his sister. I tried to address it without revealing my feelings. He told me he used to have feelings for me but he now only sees me as his sister. \n\nNow that we’re all caught up, on to the update. So many comments said my approach should’ve been direct. A few people thinking he probably has feelings for me but is also scared I don’t feel the same way. \n\nWell sorry to disappoint that wasn’t the case. A couple days ago he sent me a TikTok of a guy saying something like “to my girl friends if you’ve never been f*cked right it’s my duty to show you what good d*ck feels like”. So with this TikTok and the encouragement of the comments I finally did it. I responded back with a TikTok I found that says something like “when he’s calling you his sister but he should be calling you his soulmate” he responded with a laugh emoji. I responded back I’m serious. \n\nIt took him a couple hours to respond to this. I was sure he still didn’t get it but finally he did. He called me as he was leaving work. He asked if the TikTok meant what he thought it meant. I said if you think it means that I feel like we’re meant to be together but you’re out here calling me your sister then yes. He just went silent. So silent that I had to check to make sure the call hadn’t disconnected. \n\nI said um did I break you. He asked where this was coming from. I said I’ve had feelings for a while and I wasn’t sure he felt the same way so I just hadn’t said anything. \n\nWell a couple of y’all guessed what happened next. He has a problem with my size. Since this is anonymous anyway might as well just put the numbers. Back in high school I was around 250lbs. I graduated early so I finished at the end of my junior year to allow myself a gap year. During this time I was working 2 full time jobs and a part time job. (I know, when tf did I sleep??). After an accident where I fell down some concrete stairs and broke my leg in 2 places. It was winter and the stairs were icy. I lost all 3 of my jobs and was unemployed for the next 10months. I was extremely depressed and definitely put on some weight and had just been going up in weight for years after. Now I’m currently at 432lbs and still on the longest journey to get back to at least my high school weight for now. \n\nHe said he’s never dated anyone my size before and does not know how that would work. You know during sex. None of this was making sense to me. Every single girl he has dated is technically the same size as me. He has always dated shorter girls 5’- 5’3” and by his own account they were around 200-250lbs. I am 5’7”. Technically the way I carry weight the size is no different than anyone else he has dated. What I did not know is one time I went to lunch with him after a doctors appointment and he saw some papers from the visit in my car and it had my weight on there which at the time was 464lbs. \n\nThis apparently is when he started looking at me differently. He just didn’t think it would “logistically work out”. But oh don’t worry he understands that I have literally everything he is looking for in a relationship. He actually said “you always fill in the gap when I don’t have a girlfriend”. \n\nSeriously wtf! I had to dig real deep into my years of therapy because my first thought was okay so if I get back to 250 then he’ll have feelings for me again. I was disgusted with myself for even thinking that. Needless to say we haven’t talked in days. I scheduled another therapy appointment. And I don’t think we can even be friends after this. I guess thanks Reddit for encouraging me to have a direct conversation and really discover how he feels about me. \n\nEdit to add: I guess the comments think I put this weight on overnight. This was over 7-8 years of unhealthy choices and habits where I was in a place that I was severely depressed and did not care if I lived or not. Even once I started back working I had to take a job I hated and was having the hardest time finding something new so my habits continued. I was working an office job from home and I was not working out at all. I made a comment explaining more so I won’t duplicate that here. I am not in any way mad that he feels this way. I’m just sad. There is also a comment explaining that too but I’m a US Size 4x he is a US size 3x. This is part of why his reason shocked me. It’s not like he’s a super skinny guy. I am not in denial about my size. I know I’m a big girl and I am working on that. I know my size is no one’s fault but my own for not waking up sooner. I’m allowed to feel sad and ashamed. Regardless of size you can’t possibly tell me you wouldn’t feel sad the person you love has basically admitted to using you as a place filler. \n\nLast edit: To all the comments saying it’s fake based on my size comparison I have stood next to these girls and really did not think I’m that much bigger than them. I guess from the comments I may have body dysmorphia. I have a big chest and carry more weight in my hips and thighs than my stomach also I’ve been working on body comp so have kind of distributed out to muscle as well I have lost more inches than actual numbers. A few people think I’m just saying I’m working on it and but not actually doing anything. I actually mean I'm working on it. I made another comment on this but. I'm in a cooking class to learn healthier eating and making healthy meals. I have a personal trainer I meet with twice a week. I'm seeing a dietitian. I didn't put it in my other comment but I have PCOS and thyroid issues that hormonally just makes it harder but I have doctors for that as well. I’m very much real and honestly trying not to take all these comments to heart. That wasn’t even what the post was about but thank you everyone for pointing out this thing I can’t change overnight.

      "selftext": "It’s been a while and honestly I had forgot I made this post but I have been really stressed thinking about the situation so I thought I’d get it out by typing it.\n\nFirst things first I wanna say I did have a conversation with valentine about therapy, he agreed to go after a bit of convincing so I’m getting that all settled for him. \n\nI talked to my ex, unfortunately she’s gonna try to turn this into a custody battle even tho she willingly gave up her custody the first time around, I just hope this doesn’t turn out bigger then it should be. I’ve been talking with my lawyer and they say we have a pretty good defense against her so this shouldn’t be difficult.\n\nAnd the most stressful thing was the conversation with my brother, a lot of people were saying i shouldn’t talk to him but I’m sure hearing what he said would change your mind. I wanna add context that my brother is the oldest out of all of us and I’m the second oldest boy, which kind of made him a big figure in my life. I’ve overlooked a lot of his behaviors towards me as just older brother stuff and after the conversation with him I realized it wasn’t normal.\n\nwhen I pulled up he offered me to come inside and I refused asking him if we could talk outside on his porch. Once we were all settled i didn’t directly ask him about it, i didn’t want him to shut down or get to defensive so i tried slither it in there but I think he knew why I was there maybe it was because i hadn’t called him myself or reached out at all since the affair but he knew. You’d think he’d deny it or show some guilt but he said with a straight face that he touched my son, no remorse whatsoever just said it casually.\n\n I asked him why he would do that because that’s his nephew, his family, his blood, a child. Honestly I can’t stop replaying what he said to me in my head because he’s looking dead in my eyes as he’s talking. “You weren’t gonna keep quiet if I touched you anymore”\n\nI really thought he was trying to be fucking funny cause who says that while their being confronted for molesting a child, honestly I was looking around for the cameras cause this had to be a movie I had not idea I had a role in. Maybe he thought he was this big bad alpha male villain with snarky one liners with that one, but it made me sick and it made me cringe cause he casually admitted to being a sick pervert. The man has kids what if he was molesting them too?\n\nI wish I could say that I he was trying to be funny, but I think he actually meant it. Thinking about it playing strip tag with your older brother is weird and there’s so many moments when we were alone that I felt uncomfortable about and i never knew why. I have a feeling my parents knew about this to i don’t know what it is maybe it’s just my family, but Hispanic families are constantly covering up and hiding predators in our families, this is maybe the 3rd time. \n\nI’m just all over the place my mind is just running like a hamster on a wheel and I think I’m genuinely losing it. I didn’t file a police report not yet because Valentine almost hurt himself last time i suggested that so I’m respect his wishes of not taking this to the police.",

      "selftext": "She was one of those quiet girls who barely talked to anyone, especially guys. Always polite, soft-spoken, but distant.\n\nWhen I first met her, I didn’t think we’d ever get close. I had my own group of friends, and she seemed like the kind of person who would stay in her own world. But somehow, even when there were four or five people around, she’d always end up talking to me. Not in a flirty or special way, but she always found her way to me. That small, quiet attention started meaning something to me.\n\n\nOver time, I began to care about her. Not because she was expressive or loud, but because she wasn’t. She carried a quiet sadness, and I just wanted to make things easier for her. She was dealing with a lot ...... fights with her close friend, family issues, her mom being unwell. I didn’t plan to like her; it just happened slowly, through late-night talks, small jokes, and the comfort of being around her.\n\nThen one day her best friend told her that it looked like I liked her, and from that point, everything changed. She became distant, colder. Texts slowed down. When we met, she’d avoid eye contact. When I asked if something was wrong, she simply said not to take things personally. That hit hard because to me, she was personal.\n\nAfter that, she started talking more with others, especially two guys from our group. I’d sit there pretending it didn’t bother me, but it did. When I finally asked her why she was so interested in talking to everyone else but me, she just laughed and said not to take it seriously, that she was just juggling conversations. She never actually answered my questions. Every time I tried to talk about what bothered me, she’d push the topic away or change the subject. It made me feel like my emotions were inconvenient.\n\nAround that time, our friend group started falling apart, and honestly, I didn’t mind. But somewhere in all that, I realized she was pulling away on purpose. Then one night, she called me crying. She said she felt left out, but later admitted she was crying because I wasn’t talking to her like I used to. I stayed on the call, comforted her, tried to make her feel better. For a moment, it felt like she cared too.\n\nBut the next few days, everything went back to normal. She laughed and talked with those same guys again while I kept pretending it didn’t hurt. She called me a good friend, and I tried to act like that word didn’t sting.\n\nA few weeks later she cried again... said her best friend had said something hurtful... I stayed up talking to her for nearly an hour, just listening and trying to make her feel better... and when I hung up, it hit me... she only came to me when she needed comfort... when she was happy, I didn’t exist.\n\nThat realization hurt the most... I wasn’t her first choice... I was just her safe place.\n\nAfter that I started pulling away... my replies got shorter... I stopped over-explaining myself... she noticed and asked why I was distant... I told her I was fine, just busy... but the truth was, I was tired... tired of caring so much for someone who didn’t value it.\n\nFor two months, I stayed quiet... it hurt, but it brought peace.\n\nWhen college resumed, she started talking to me again like nothing had ever happened... she’d text me whenever she was upset, and I’d still reply, just without the same energy... one night, she asked why I was so distant... I told her I needed to move on.\n\nShe said I’d regret losing a friend like her... but she didn’t understand... I wasn’t trying to lose her, I was just trying to respect myself.\n\nA few days later we had a long call... almost two hours... for the first time, I told her everything... how I felt, how her distance hurt, how I’d been holding on quietly all this time... she listened for a while and then said she always thought of me like a brother.\n\nThat broke me completely... because no “brother” stays up comforting you, loses sleep for you, or cares that deeply without expecting anything... I didn’t want anything physical... I just wanted to be valued, to be seen.\n\nOn the last day before we went home, she seemed awkward sitting beside me... moments later, she hugged one of the same guys she once said made her uncomfortable... that was my silent closure... she couldn’t sit next to me, but she could hug him... that told me everything I needed to know.\n\nEven now she says things like we should stay friends... or you’ll regret losing me... but she doesn’t get it. I’m not asking for friendship... I just wanted respect for my feelings.\n\nI cared... genuinely, quietly, deeply... but she never valued it. So now I’m choosing distance... not because I stopped caring, but because I finally realized that love without respect isn’t love at all... sometimes walking away isn’t weakness... it’s how you keep your self-worth alive.\n\nTL;DR... I fell for a quiet girl who made me feel special, but when my feelings became obvious, she pulled away and acted like it didn’t matter... I was always there when she was low, but she never cared the same way... now I’m yet to learn to choose peace and self-respect over someone who never really saw what I felt :)\n\n\n\n\n",

It's hard to say I'm happy for her when inside me feels so empty. I actually don't know what to think or do. I kinda feel a sense of closure in that there's no need to try again or hope. She's gone. And I don't know if I'll ever stop feeling this way about her or if I'll ever feel this way about someone else again. Maybe I don't deserve to have someone like that again. I was and still am a pretty stupid guy. Thought I'd grown and shit. That was just crap I told myself to feel like I deserve her again. If I don't find love again it's fine, I brought this upon myself and now I have to deal with the consequences of my dumb actions. The younger me would've never expected I'd end up like this.",

      "selftext": "I want to make this very clear, the post talks about some pretty heavy topics and I’m writing while actively spiraling so it may be incomprehensible at times.\n\nThis all started because of a stupid arguments between him and his friend. My bf, J, was arguing with his friend, D, about anime characters being sexualized, and I got involved and gave my input because I’m afab. D started being hurtful, and called my boyfriend a pedophile, womanizer, and a porn addict because we were both saying an anime girl’s body was somewhat anatomically correct. I decided to look for realistic examples that were similar to the character, and I realized that my younger self was pretty much the same body type. Unfortunately before I could actually respond to his argument, D left the chat. I started spiraling the day after(which is today) because I kept thinking that D’s argument was based in purity culture values as the anime girl’s body was wearing somewhat revealing clothing, and that got me thinking about the way some awful people made me feel about my body. I hated being catcalled and I just kept thinking how I could’ve “deserved it” because I wore skirts and crop tops. This further devolved into me remembering a situation I was in for a while. In my freshman year of hs, I ran away from home for a while and stayed with my best friend, L, and her family. They lived in a smaller house, and my best friend didn’t have her own room, so I stayed with her brother for a while. Her brother, A(~27m), and I got closer and even after I went home, I’d still go over to L’s house to hang out. At this point in time, I was struggling with my mental health, and i don’t think this excuses my actions, but it helps explain them. I willingly engaged with intimate acts with A. My brain is telling me it doesn’t count as sexual assault because I came onto him and willingly did all of those things, but I know that I was a kid, barely 14, and that was legally rape. The night before, during J and D’s argument, I mentioned how D has no clue what an actual pedo is and that he should see some of the shit I had to deal with online. I told J about a predator I encountered on discord and how my friends and I fucked around with them(we leaked their dms with me asking if i had boobs when i told him i was 14) before reporting them to discord, getting him banned from the big server them was on, and blocking them. J asked if I had ever had to deal with pedophiles actually grooming me/ assaulting me, and I told him no, kinda forgetting the whole incident with A. I don’t know what to do now that I’ve remembered it all. On one hand, I was a willing participant at the time, and on the other I was a kid with no real support system. I had to deal with other possible forms of SA, like my brother showing me porn as an elementary school kid, and a really pushy and somewhat abusive ex. Honestly, seeing it all written down is surreal. Only 1 other person knows about what happened between me and A, that being an online friend. I want to reach out to the people I know, but I don’t know how to even tell people irl about it. I don’t know how id bring that up in any conversation. I would like to say, I trust my boyfriend fully. I do my best to tell him everything, but this feels like its too much. I know he’d ask a lot of questions, and he’s extremely protective, but I can’t deal with questions. I don’t want to protect A, but it’d ruin my relationship with L. I never told L cause I don’t know how she would react. Telling my family is entirely out of the question, and I don’t have a therapist or someone else to talk to about it all. I think I’m spiraling, and I should stop thinking about it all, but the thought just stays there. I don’t know what to do anymore.",

And he rebells aggressively especially when we are alone.\n\nFor context: He is two year old and extremely violent and strong. We are talking punching, kicking, biting, throwing. You name it. For me that means constant bruising, a couple black eyes, dislocated joints, drawing blood from biting and light concussions. He chipped one of my teeth and even kicked his dad so hard, he needs a hernia operation.\n\nAlso my ex husband was abusive and it often reminds me of him. Especially when my toddler hurts me and as soon as he realizes he hurt me, starts crying and I have to comfort him. I feel all alone with my pain just like I did back then and I just want to get away from him, isolate and cry. But I can't, because I need to take care of him. So I end up masking all the time and I am just completly exhausted at this point.\n\nI don't know how to handle that anymore. I am aware that most toddlers rebel in a physical way, but this is extreme. At least it feels that way. I just needed to get that out I am not looking for advise. We are trying everything, but nothing works. When I ask people about it, they say that we simply have to stick it out and he will get calmer as he ages. But I don't know how to get through this.",

Every time I try to lose weight, he looks at me funny. He thinks counting calories is a slippery slope to an eating disorder, and im not allowed to work out properly because he thinks lifting anything moderately heavy will kill you.\n\nHe puts pointless restrictions on me and projects his hate from working all day on me. I remember my tenth birthday he got really drunk and threatened to break my birthday present, a nine year old laptop. he then started yelling profanities at me. He is 90% of the reason for my depression.\n\nDespite all of this, he has never hit me, and half of the time is an ok dad. I only listed the bad things, so it makes him seem worse then he is even if there aren't that many GOOD things, and he usually only does bad things when hes drunk. I feel terrible because he isn't abusive, a meth addict, and provides for me. i can empathize with the fact he works 10 hours a day and has to do a lot of household chores + his own abusive father, but hes so immature the way he dumps it all on me and continues the cycle. I wont ever touch a drop of alcohol or have children because of him.\n\nThe only thing I want to do is leave. I want to move out to college and live alone.

Things got really bad with bullying in temple and I hated it for a time. I have grown to love it but during that time I made a mistake. I started watching porn which is huge. Someone was caught a few years ago and he go banned from the religeon and had to move states. I started watching porn the beginning of last year. I tried to stop many time but I always came back when I felt down and needed a quick rush or was bored. I am a busy person and am in classes and hobbies every day of the week. I have a bad problem with procrastination and it seems like i never get anything done. My mom opened my computer today and found it. She is disgusted at it and she cannot even look at me in the eye. It has never been like this before because she was the one person constantly on my side. She wants to tell the temple council because she is lost but it will ruin us. I miss my mom and I feel like I am suffocating. I have also been referred to a therapist several times for mental health concerns from my doctor. I don't know what to do.

How can I show her and get help? What steps do I need to take?\n\n  \nUpdate:\n\nMy parents want me to go to rehab but I am asking we look into therapy. I am scared. If I go to rehab it will uplift my life and studies. Does anyone have suggestions?",

I lost 20 lbs in the last 3 mo, because a lot of the days I get so fucking busy in the hospital that I don’t sit down or eat anything for the entire day. 0 meal. I don’t complain that, when I get home, the house is a complete warzone most of the time. I just clean up the house without bitching and moaning. I don’t complain that the meal is not ready, I don’t complain that the laundry is not done. Because I understand that my wife is struggling with our baby, and I feel bad that I can’t help out more. But I am human, with limited energy. I can barely stay awake driving on my way back home. You want me to do more around the house? I’m doing my best, so at least TRY to have some fucking sense, Ma. I don’t mean to glorify what I do coz it’s really nothing special, but I have patients literally fucking dying on me at work, so I HAVE to work. I have to work otherwise we’ll have no income. She says she doesn’t want her daughter to live like a slave. She says she regrets letting her daughter marry me. Fuck you. I’m sure MY parents don’t wanna see their son live like this either. I love your daughter, but fuck you, seriously. Fuck you bitch.",

      "selftext": "Addition content warnings for addiction, physical abuse, and sexual abuse. I (18NB) have struggled with suicidal ideation since I was about 5, per my mom's account. I dont remember a lot of my childhood, as it was filled with relentless abuse. However, I never even got the worst of it. My little brother (16M) went through the worst abuse and that had traumatized me even more than what I went through myself. My mom is evil, and has done countless things that any person would hear and say \"why didn't cps come?\" Well, they actually did. CPS talked to me on multiple accounts, so did police officers one night when she locked me inside the house for being suicidal. They never did anything. My parents divorced when I was 10, and I was sexually abused by my 18 y/o stepbrother when I was 13. I confided in my only friend at the time and she asked me if he was hot. I then overdosed and almost died in the hospital. I've had permanent memory issues since then but not sure if it's tied to the overdose. Now, I have nothing except my pets, and that will soon be gone too. I don't think I will be here longer than a year, and here's why: 1. I have absolutely no support. I do not have any friends. I do not have any family that cares about me(as far as I know, they do not talk to me and I honestly think only my brother would care if I died but he doesn't really care about me anymore either, I haven't seen him in a while.) I don't have any relationships, and as soon as I do, I immediately mess them up because of uncontrolled bpd. I have been diagnosed. \n2. I truly don't think there's any way I will ever feel better. As said earlier, I've wanted to die since I was a very young girl. I have been on max doses of meds, mindfulness therapy, institutions, therapy, group therapy, psychiatry, eating better, working out, everything. I have not ever had a moment in my life where the back of my mind wasn't screaming how much I wanted to die\n3. I have no future. I have no car, no license, no job, no highschool degree, nowhere to go. I will be kicked out of my mother's house in like 9 months. I won't have anywhere to go, just homeless. I have chronic illness and can't work very well on my own anyway.\n4. I can't afford any other mental health help right now or in the future. I don't want to reach out to a hotline, they are literally NEVER helpful. \n\nThat brings me to my pets. Peanut is my dog. I've had her since I was 11. She's continuously saved me from attempting again, mainly because she has separation anxiety and I wouldn't want to leave her here alone. I also have a senior cat, a young cat, 4 rats, a leopard gecko, and 2 spiders. They are my only reasons for living. I get up and take care of them and that's the only reason I haven't done anything. Once I become homeless, I won't be able to take them with me, and I'll be all alone with no reason to live. I feel like the only thing I can do now is enjoy the time I have left because I don't believe in myself to stay alive after my everything is gone. Please don't tell me to reach out to a hotline, I've been doing that for 7 years and all it's done is make it worse. I hate them. It's all so scripted and annoying. I wish I could talk to someone who actually went through the same thing/something similar. Thanks for reading if you did I just really wanted to vent all this out. ",

It made me feel weird. \nCouple weeks later I was asked out by one of the security at our work and I said yes. We had a very nice date and went out for a second date. I don’t like to get physical super early on and I stress to people that I don’t do hookups and am looking for something long term. Well second date we slept together even tho it didn’t feel right to me. The next day he told me I would have to remain a secret and nothing serious would ever come of our interaction which I was upset over I thought I voiced my boundary pretty clear. I confronted him and he met up with me to talk and he said he didn’t mean what he said and English isn’t his first language. I was going to go inside and he needed to use the bathroom but he then slept with me again. I didn’t want to but I also didn’t specifically say no so my fault. \nI ended things after that saying I didn’t feel respected or that my boundaries were being honoured and he tried to say he was about to commit to me and it made me feel manipulated. \n\nThe first guy I went on a date with I met his girlfriend of three years last weekend.

The security also last weekend made sure I knew he took two women home.  He kept looking back at me to make sure I was watching him with them. \n\nI feel so gross. This place is so gross.

      "selftext": "Around 5 months ago, my ex (22f) of around 2 years broke up with me (24m). There weren't any issues in our relationship, our communication was great, and everything looked like it was going well. However, she was very unhappy in her life due to a lack of friends, lack of family presence, lack of hobbies, and she also worked a remote job that made her unhappy. Whenever we spent time together, she would always be bubbly, happy, and fun to be around, but when we were apart, she would just be miserable until we hung out again and felt sad whenever I had to leave. I tried my best to help her find hobbies and social events to help fill this gap and she would go to them, but nothing would stick.\n\nEventually, she came to the decision to move back home with family (2 hours away) to focus on herself and build up her happiness again. However, in order to do so, she believed that she needed to be single and celibate for at least a year, both so she can properly heal, and also because she believed it isn't fair for me to date someone who is \"mentally unwell like (her)\" and how I deserve someone \"healthier\" and \"better\". So, on the last day we hung out, we had a long talk where a lot of crying and reminiscing was involved, and we even briefly fantasized about potentially getting back together after some time in the future (but also realized how this is unrealistic and we won't know where our minds are at months from the breakup, while also establishing that it would be unfair to promise this). We also agreed to go no contact for at least 6-months, and if either one of us wanted to reach out after that period, both of us were open to it.\n\nThe start of November marks the 6-months, and given that she was the one to breakup with me, I don't see myself being the one to reach out (mostly out of self respect for myself). However, for the longest time I've been hoping that she'll be the one to reach out, that maybe even she'll be in a better mind space and want to get back together again. It doesn't help that come August 2026 I might be starting grad school in an institution practically next to where she currently lives, so I just keep thinking about our potential future together.\n\nI'm not miserable right now or anything, I have a good job, family, friends, and hobbies, but I just couldn't bring myself to try to date anyone since the breakup and even now since I'm clinging to the hope that she'll come back to me or at least reach out once the no contact timeframe is up. I've downloaded dating apps and had opportunities to go out on dates, but I just can't bring myself to actually go through with them.\n\nI think if it has been a week after the no-contact passes and she still hasn't contacted me, I'll know for certain that I'm no longer a thought in her mind and I'll be able to fully move on with my dating life. However, until it reaches that point, I've just been living in a delusion where she has been working on herself so that she can come back to me with a healthier mind, and I'm just waiting for the day that it happens.",

      "selftext": "Hey, I don’t think this is completely the right subreddit but I just need to vent because I’m somewhat like over my mother-in-law.\n\nSo I (23F) have been with my partner B (22M) for a bit over 6 years I don’t have much experience you could definitely say with dating as this is my first official boyfriend but he is a really really amazing guy, but my issue comes into play with his parents so I guess my in-laws kinda always putting me down. I have gone to family and friends about this stuff and they all kinda go “aw that sucks” and basically just “yikes” but I haven’t gotten any advice on how to approach some of the things they say or do I just keep being quiet. \n\nLil bit of background his family are completely obsessed about fitness they did like triathlons and stuff when they were my age or younger until they had B. \n\nSo obviously I was somewhat young when we started dating I believe I was 16 but the first time I met them they made it a point that I should start going to the gym - I was at this point of my life somewhat depressed due to something that happened to me earlier in the year so I hadn’t been eating much, but I was on anti depressants/anxiety medication plus the pill (birth control) which made me not look large at all but well especially then I hadn’t (sadly and still haven’t) lost any baby weight in my face I looked in my opinion healthy - but back then I was maybe close to less than 60kg. \nThere has since always been a push for me to go for runs, gym, bike ride or do organised sports. I don’t know to get them to stop pushing all this. I’m not interested and I’m kinda tired of it. B has tried to say to stop as they are pushing it on him too but it’s kinda relentless with how much they ask. \n\nTo expand somewhat on this his mum (M) always goes on about how she’s too young to be a grandmother (she’s about 55 I think) and that we better not be having kids yet. I used to be on the bar but she noticed I got it removed due to the fact I shouldn’t have ever got it in the first place as it was a health concern for me to have it in as I have PCOS and my doctor advised against birth control for a while until I could get my hormones to a good level. M didn’t like this - I tried to explain but she just kept going on about how there’s the pill and the other thing and one of them will be fine for me, but I followed my drs advice thank goodness!! I have also been told by a few doctors I will struggle to get pregnant, I don’t really know why but hey I’m just not worrying about it. The pregnancy stuff started when I was about 17-18 and it hasn’t really stopped. \n\nThere are heaps more things but I realised this is super long but the last thing is probably what strains my relationship the most - which is the stress she puts on B, I don’t completely know how to explain it but he gets very overwhelmed when she messages, calls or when either of his parents ask for him to come over for dinner or something, I have slowly worked with him over the years to get him to a place where he doesn’t completely shut down and feel like being sick. There are many many examples and ways she has put this on him but I really don’t want to overdo this as I already have wrote a lot but I’m an open book. \n\nI’ve suggested to B that maybe he should chat to his dad about it and maybe encourage therapy for his mum to deal with her stress and how to have a more healthier mental state. But when he has brought this up his mum or dad they just dismiss him and say there’s nothing wrong. \n\nI feel so bad to feel this way and like I never wanted to struggle when it comes to like my partner‘s parents and I don’t know what to do. \n\nAlso we are going for a week long holiday next year with them and I’m really worried about it. I didn’t want to go but it’s all expenses paid and my family could never afford something like this and my partner and I even though we’ve got stable jobs are saving, so even though we both thought a bit anxious and I guess we self sabotaged ourselves a bit we are hoping we can just have a holiday together. \n\nThank you!!

      "selftext": "I'm 24F. My family is pretty religious. My grandpa was a preacher, and my family attended the church he preached at. My parents went through phases of being a little more lenient with religion, to being more pious than normal. Sometimes they'd restrict things my brother and I could read or watch because it was \"satanic\" or \"demonic\". They'd read the Bible to us before bed and make us pray before going to sleep. Other times, they didn't care. They were very wishy washy. \n\nI developed scrupulosity. I was obsessed with whether or not God or Jesus hated me. Whether or not I'd die and go to Hell. Or family members of mine dying and going to hell. I thought negative things (negative opinions I'd keep to myself about *anything,* for example) made me a bad person. Bad people do or think bad things, and they go to hell, so I was going to hell. I just thought, as a five year old, up until I was about twelve-ish, that I was the exception. I was damned. It didn't matter I got saved or baptized. I was damned. \n\nPeople always talked about how God would speak to them or show them signs. I was a child and took this literally. I wondered what was so bad or wrong with me that made God not want to talk to me or want to show me signs. I asked for them, but nothing ever happened. By the time I was around 12-13, I had unlimited and unmonitored access to the internet. I googled all my religion related questions and was no longer religious. I fell down a pipeline of mad non-believer (I can't say the actual name for it without this getting removed) pipeline and I honestly *hated* everyone who was religious. I thought I had all the answers, I was so smart and knew better than everyone else. Obviously, I did not tell my family about this. They *still* believe I am religious. Although I'm not angry anymore, I'm still not religious at all. \n\nMy family are Baptists. My grandpa passed last year. His position at the church has been replaced, I still attend here and there for the sake of my mom and grandma. My mom doesn't go nearly as much as she used to. Whenever I do go to church with them, I drive to my mom's house and carpool with her, her partner, and my brother to church. Every time, I am carrying a cup with me and I am drinking during the church service. I start when we get halfway to the church. I stop when I feel it. We normally go out to eat afterward (still carpooling, so I am not driving), so after the meal, it's worn off. \n\nIt's difficult going to church when I have so many negative memories there. It's not just about not liking church or not liking religion. I mean, I beat myself up all the time because I didn't think I was as good or as worthy as everyone else. I constantly wondered why God hated me, why he wouldn't talk to me, and why he wouldn't answer my prayers. \n\nAnd just to be clear - I am not driving drunk. At one point, I had a little too much. I knew I should not drive home, which was about 15 minutes away. I drove about 20 seconds down the road from her house and waited in a Dollar General parking lot, ate something, and slept it off until I was safe to drive home. It's on the same street as her house, I'm not on a busy road, the road I drove on was a neighborhood. I drove like a snail until I was in the parking lot. \n\nI've done this so many times and I feel bad. I know it's not healthy, but I cannot go to church sober. ",

I’m not going into much detailes on those terrible things, which, for the most of them, I’m pretty sure I’m healed. I almost died at 17, for health reasons, and for a while I did change my point of view, I thought I could go through everything and still be happy and grateful, even just for being alive, but I feel delusional now. Fact is, if there’s a way to make me suffer, life will find it and use it against me, and I’m kinda tired. I’ve never been happy, yet, I smiled and was always helping others every day, making it my mission to be there for people, to make their life better, to provide for them. But now, I see as days passes by, that nobody really thinks of me, nobody’s interested, not my family, maybe just one or two friends, and that’s it. Never the first choice (never actually a choice), never loved, always being abandoned for other things (journeys mostly). At some point everyone in my life has this urge to leave, and leaves me as well. I fell in love one too many time now, and I fell hard, really hard. So hard that I could finally see a future with this one, I saw it, and then, a couple of days ago life again hits me so hard, he’s going to leave soon, less than a month from now, after being together for six months, and at this point I’m fed up. I know that probably my purpose in this life is to give others directions, that I’m here for helping people, for teaching them, that’s all I did all my life. Always forgiving, always understanding, never been angry in my life, never even shown rage (it just happened once in an extreme situation), and everyone is always telling me about how amazing I am, how I can make anyone feel pure calm around me, yet, nobody wants me, except for myself, and that is a pure act of love toward myself that I want to end all of this. I want a little of rest, finally some calm all for myself, no more others, just me and my forever sleep, silence and nobody that could ever destroy me, even because there’s nothing more to ruin, I’m shattered. I just want to have a little serenity. I don’t know for what I’m being punished, but I will not go any further, I love myself and my serenity more than that, and I can’t let people hurting me anymore, I just can’t. I’ve been beaten up for years, raped, stalked, molested, almost killed, abandoned and so much more… I really need to stop all of this, I cannot go through anything else. I’m sorry if this triggers anyone, that was not my intention… i just needed to tell somebody. I haven’t decided what day it’ll be, but it’s going to be soon, I hope in 2 days max… I just really hope that I’ll build the courage then… I really hope it for myself, i need to give myself a well deserved rest after all of the things i went through, I have no hope or faith anymore, I finally lost it all. To everyone reading until this point, please, be kind to others, go help when needed, if someone struggles go say a few words, and always be truthful, don’t lie to people, don’t pretend to care about them, please, spread kindness, that’s all the world needs. Please be better.",

      "selftext": "Not looking for anything I know I’m all the way wrong but hopefully posting on here will help me move on.\n\nA few months ago I met this guy at a work event. I felt an instant connection to him and we exchanged socials. We kept in contact and made plans to meet up but those plans always fell through and then I didn’t hear from him more. While we were in contact we did exchange some pictures with each other.\n\nA few months ago he uploaded a story on one of his socials captioned “best day of my life.” It was a wedding photo. I was crushed and confused. A few days later he started messaging me again and I don’t know why I didn’t confront him but then again didn’t hear more from him.\n\nWe never met up, I haven’t heard from him but still had him on socials, until today. For weeks I’ve been constantly thinking about him and stalking his profile and finally I decided enough was enough and removed him from everything. I also deleted any media and chats of his I had.\n\nInstead of feeling relief I felt a pit in my stomach and my hands were shaking, it took a minute for that to wear off.\n\nNow I’m sitting here sad about something that never was or will be, but still hoping to hear from him. I hate myself for that. For hoping he comes to me, tells me I’m the one, tells me I’m what he needs.\n\nI hope I get over this soon.",

      "selftext": "TLDR: People fucking suck, (also I wrote this in book format soooo yeah) and this is for 18+ only\n\nTriggers:\n\nSA and Rape and Abuse\n\nPS. Hey yall I wrote this a bit ago but I'm 18afab for clarification\n\nI was born screaming and kicking like every other baby on the planet. But, I was born into a family that only loved and supported me selectively. My mother, my dear old mother, had been through rough times of her own trauma stemming from those experiences. Yet, what trauma she sprung onto me was unnecessary. Though she may not have directly caused all of it she still played a part.\n\nMy first memory was of me drawing on a wall while screaming happened around me. That memory started to paint a picture for the rest of my childhood. My mother got with the man who is on my birth certificate, Fox, when I was barely a toddler. She had a husband at this time who was incarcerated, who should have been my dad but she cheated and ended up with a soon to be child molester. I was four when it started, right before Fox and my mother got divorced. \n\nFirst, it was watching stepdaughter and stepfather porn while on his lap. Then he taught me what precum and an erection was. After that he started touching me while trying to do math homework or vocabulary. Took “our time” for answers to test questions I didn’t quite understand. There were times where I would mind my own business and yet I could never escape his touch. Like, watching The Labrinth or playing Roblox. \n\nFor six years this continued, until I was about ten years old. But there had to have been some happy times, right? Well kind of. I mean I learned how much I loved science and how much I hated scooters. Yet, I learned how to deal with a UTI, how to suck a man off with no teeth and how to be a good little girl for her dad.  Little girl. I hated that wording. I still do to some extent. \n\nBut, it no longer has power. \n\nFor years I needed to be strong, untouchable, and not a scared little *girl*. Now I’ve grown into my own skin, with some tweaks still needed of course. (You never stop growing) I am alright being called a girl, never a little girl, I’m 18 now of course. But a girl nonetheless. I’ve been through years upon years of therapy, and I've at least learned one thing. Never give up on *yourself*. However when I was young that was hard. It seemed almost impossible not to give up. Like one thing after another knocked me down. \n\nLike when I was 8. My mother had broken it off with Fox and we had lived alone together for about 3 years. My mother tried to raise me by herself but life decided that wasn’t working. I was failing school, it was scarce for food and my mother worked nights. I found things to do that weren’t so great for me around 7. Like unsupervised internet. But she tried. Then she found Dog. An ex military, then security guard, a big dude to say the least. \n\nDog had a son and a daughter. The daughter essentially ignored me until she wanted help, but the son was a different story. He had to be around me, either to bully, harass or rape me. Whatever satisfied his fix at the time. He was 14 and I was 8. For about a year, before then he left me alone sexually. Until he realized how hard my mother and his father slept. Many, many times I was raped on the old leather couch my mother had brought with us. I went from jumping and playing on it to, almost screaming in pain but scolded to keep quiet.  Night after night, over and over, same thing, different night. \n\nI lost my tenth birthday to Dog kicking my mother out after I had told her and her friend Shane what had happened. We then moved in with Wolf and another one of my mothers friends. The other friend was nice, and sweet, maybe a little off her rocker. But overall good none the less. Wolf, though, was a wolf in sheep's clothing (haha funny joke haha). For years, until I was 16, he acted as my father figure and I called him “dad” at one point. Then when things got rough between him, my mother and their shared girlfriend he chose me to prey on so he could get his sexual fix. He only did it once in a closet. Yet all that work I had done on myself, *gone.* \n\nAfter that my mother sent me away to a mental hospital then a residential. Soon I went to a job training program and there I was able to grow my metaphorical wings and be myself. It was an overall alright experience. Even with the few terrible people there. Near the beginning of my stay there I met my Boyfriend of almost a year. He and my best friend of four years are the people that keep me standing today. So I write this all to get it off my chest. The full and unfiltered story. With out my mother's helicopter eyes over me. \n\nSo remember, if you got this far, to live out the rest of your life. It may suck now but trust me it gets easier at some points. You’ll find people that love you for you, even in the weirdest ways. \\]\n\nThank you all for reading and have a great life you special human, and to all those who were never believed, \n\nI believe you",

      "selftext": "I’m going to a friend’s wedding next month. I’m dreading it. Because for 99% of the people there, it will be the first time they will see me in a dress or something “girly.”\n\nFor context, I am a woman. Born a woman. I’ve always been a little masculine. Not by choice, but my build has always been broad and stalky. I have little curves, no real ass and nothing remarkable for a chest. I played sports, like “guy-ish” things. My mom never had to work on looking girly, so she never taught me how to do makeup or style my hair or anything. She was a model. Girly is her default no matter if she wears a dress or basketball shorts and an oversized tee. She just assumed I was perceived the same way by the world.\n\nI barely know how to do makeup. I throw on foundation and blush and mascara and hope it looks ok. Which it doesn’t but it’s whatever.\n\nSo my entire adult life, i’ve kind of hidden myself away in t-shirts/sweaters/jeans and not much else. I never put my hair up because i look even more manly. I want to be girly. I want to look cute. But I feel like a freak while wearing anything considered that.\n\nMy friend group is, if I’m gonna be blunt, a bunch of fucking assholes. They make fun of me. Call me manly, a lesbian or trans. (which by the way i have no problem with, but it’s the connotation they say it that makes it insulting. As if i’m not attractive so I must be a lesbian or trans.)\n\nThese are all things that I’ve heard for years that have made me dread this wedding. It’s to the point that I want something to happen to me, like some accident, so I can get out of it. Because the entire time I’ve been dress shopping, I hear what they are going to say to me at the wedding.\n\nI’ve lost weight this year just so i could try and look better in a dress. I’ve lost almost 40 pounds since January. I’ve eaten the same two meals almost every day this year. And yet I am still getting anxiety attacks just thinking about this. I look like a fraud. I look manly in a dress. I don’t know what to do.\n\nAnd I know I will be told that I should leave my friends. I know. It’s something I’m working on. Because I have some of the best times in my life with these people. But they’ve also killed my spirit. It’s hard to navigate mentally. \n\nThe worst part about it all, is that I think i look okay. Not pretty by any means, but okay. I just want people to think I’m okay looking. \n",

      "selftext": "Today I (27F) recalled a memory that when I was 14, my parents put down our cat (Tiger) and didn't tell me or my brother. One night when I was 14, I was locking up the house with my family before bed and I was trying to do what we did each night and recall our outdoor cat (please don't come for me on this, I was a child) so that he would sleep inside at night. After trying and failing I asked my mum if she had already brought Tiger in for the night and she just responded with, something along the lines of, \"what are you talking about\". After minutes of confusion my parents started laughing at me and asking \"haven't you noticed that he hasn't come back at all this week?\". I'm still confused and then they tell me \"We put Tiger down. Over a week ago.\" I remember just feeling so sad and angry but my parents said to me \"you must not have cared for the cat if you didn't notice he was gone.\"\nWhen asked about why, the reasoning my parents gave was that because our family dog (Belle) had died a week (or two) prior they didn't want to detract from my brother and I mourning Belle's passing by telling us that Tiger was getting put down. So they just did it in secret, I guess...\nI can't remember anything about how my brother reacted to the news because it was also a surprise to him that night. Undecided if I want to bring it up with him because maybe he's left that slight trauma in the past.\nThe reason that Tiger got put down was because he viciously attacked our 70F next door neighbour out of nowhere (orange cat behaviour). Although now that I'm writing this I'm wondering if that is what really happened or just another lie my parents told and they put Tiger down because they just didn't want to deal with him.",

      "selftext": "I wasn’t sure where to put this story. It’s rather short and not that tragic, sad really. Just figured, maybe someone will read it and hear me out. \n\nBefore I begin, maybe you would want to know that I am a woman of 26 years old. English isn’t my first language, but I felt more comfortable using it.\n\nSo, you might have seen those videos on YouTube and TikTok where strangers answer interesting questions like “when did you know it was love?” or “what’s your biggest regret?” etc. Those videos are heartfelt and sometimes heartbreaking, making you relate to people you don’t even know. Honestly, I like to imagine myself being in front of that camera and telling my story, but more than often than not there’s just nothing worth telling.\n\nRecently I was watching one of those where the question was “what was the most painful thing you’ve been told?” As always, I’ve tried to think of an answer and an old memory came up and hit me like a truck. So I think I have to paint a picture for some context before I give an answer. \n\nI was about 10 or 12 years old. My mother and I lived at my stepfather’s apartment. It was a rather small place: a corridor, a little bedroom, a kitchen and a bathroom. Not a very pleasant place to live, but my mom and stepfather didn’t have enough money to rent anything else at the time, and I didn’t really have a choice of where to stay.\n\nThe atmosphere in our family back then was, for the lack of a better word, strange. I mean, during the day my stepfather was just a guy. A man who worked, drove us places, was friendly most of the time - nothing outstanding. But when evenings came around, he started drinking. Nothing hard, just beer, though he drank so much that he transformed into a scary monster. He never hit us, but he was telling awful, hurtful things to my mom. Calling her all sorts of names without any reason, practically torturing her. Before anyone says “there’s no smoke without a fire” - my mom never drank, never cheated, never even looked at other men. She didn’t even go out with her friends. I’m not sure if she even had any by that point. My stepfather was and, sadly, still is just an insecure shithead.\n\nThis bullshit went on for years, but one particular night I remember to this day.\n\nIt was a late winter evening. I was in the bedroom doing whatever. He was drinking, my mom sat beside him in the kitchen. I heard them arguing, but never paid attention. He was cussing her out again, and for some reason this time shit escalated quickly. I remember an unusually strong sense of fear. I went to the corridor and saw my mother storming out of the kitchen - tears streaming down, her face red and furious. She looked at me and said, “Get ready, we’re leaving”.\n\nI was shocked. But it was late, winter was dark and cold outside, I was tired and terrified - a million reasons I now try to come up with to justify why I refused to go. I didn’t want her to leave, but I didn’t want to go with her either. She put on her coat and insisted again, to no avail. So she left.\n\nI remember looking at the closed door, hearing a drunk mumbling beast in the kitchen and feeling an intensifying terror in my body. For a second I wanted to go back to the bedroom, but went to the bathroom instead. Shut the door, closed the latch and started waiting.\n\nWhen the drunken man realised that my mom had left, he started to look for the keys to go after her. He figured where I was and started to beat the shit out of the bathroom door, shouting at me and demanding the keys. For some reason he couldn’t find his own and blamed me for it.\n\nI remember that bathroom vividly: greenish tiles, old rusty bathtub, cold floor and hot dry radiators on the wall, an ugly yellow ceiling light. The door was fragile and old, and my eyes were fixated on the door latch, I was begging it to hold on. While bawling my eyes out and saying that I don’t know anything: where my mother went or where the keys are. At some point I sank to the floor, helpless, horrified and devastated. Desperate for help, never knowing whether it would come.\n\nThe drunk was trying everything - he cussed, he shouted, he was banging on the door, trying to persuade me to cooperate. I think he tried to tell me that mom needed help, and I was in his way of providing it. And in the midst of it all, while trying to manipulate me to open the door, my stepfather said: “You don’t love anyone, not your mom, not your grandma”.\n\nYou would think that this is the least insulting thing that anyone could say in that situation, but for some fucking reason those words stung me more than anything I’ve ever heard. I cried that it wasn’t true, but he didn’t stop. The whole shitshow went on for some time. I don’t really remember what happened after - not when mom came home, nor what happened the next morning. All I know is that we continued living there together, acting like nothing happened.\n\nBut that feeling of being trapped, sitting on the floor, drowning in tears and that stupid yellow light, begging somebody to save me and thinking “I don’t love anyone”  - that lasted.\n\nHe never apologised; furthermore, he denied what happened, saying he doesn’t remember. I looked him in the eyes knowing for sure he’s lying. A visceral, disgusting feeling.\n\nNow, remembering all of that, trying to analyse everybody’s actions, I admit that his words broke something in me. Because since then I feel like I have never felt genuine unconditional love for anyone. Like I am really not capable of loving another human being at all. \n\nNot really sure how to end this story. Time has passed, but there’s still so much resentment and hurt and fear and hatred left. This memory makes me incredibly sad, and this gnawing feeling in my chest doesn’t go away.\n\nAnd, to answer the question in the title, the most painful thing I’ve been told, or rather taught is that I am not capable of love.",

I finally remembered how it was to feel alive with her and she understood me. Never complained and never nagged. Always positive. \n\nWhen my ex wife found out, she laughed in my face and told me how disappointing I was. “Leaving your wife of 20 something for a 20 something? How original”\n\nI told her it wasn’t her age, she laughed even harder:\n\n“Let me guess, because she cares about her looks. Because she is so positive and adventurous” then she said that when reality hits, don’t come running back. When she stops blowing you in the “most wild places” because she knows that she doesn’t have to now, when she realizes that she wants more and asks for more, when your answer and actions aren’t good enough for her, when she stays in bed, scrolling her phone all weekend, because now she has you she doesn’t need to pretend to be oh so adventurous anymore. Remember that you haven’t traded up”\n\nI didn’t believe her and she laughed at that too, she said remember how our story started? The love and respect we had and look how it ended, how do you think this one that started by hurting the people closest to you will end?\n\nThis was 9 months ago. Now I haven’t spoken with my gf for two days. She moved in with me 3 months ago and I have never been this miserable. The fights and nagging. The scrolling on her phone day and night with zero effort or energy for any adventure. The demands and small fights about small things. I know that moving in together can be an emotional and unstable but I feel that I have no feelings for this woman. I have nothing to say to her. I don’t even like her. I just keep thinking of my wife and how she knew all this. I pretend that everything is great when I am with people. I act like I am so in love, but I am dying inside. She predicted everything and I miss and love her and think about her every single day. \n\nAnd because I am not a good person, I told my gf this. I don’t know why I felt the need to tell my gf this. Maybe because she called my ex old and bitter. I told her that I will never love her like I do my ex. That took her down on earth real quick. I am sick of myself ",

      "selftext": "I’m 23F (indigenous) from Canada - does anyone know if I could apply for MAID for being suicidal 24/7\n\nI’ve never felt long term happiness, I’ve only ever experienced happy moments, majority of my life has been a shit show and I truly don’t want to continue on.\n\nI don’t want to be convinced out of this decision, I want to end my life. \n\nMy parents were always mentally exhausting to be around and deal with from since I could start remembering things- always arguing, putting me in the middle of their arguments. I had an older sister who was 15 years older than me- she passed away 3 years ago because of cancer and she was everything to me. She was my rock and someone who gave me confidence. Someone who redirected my mind from negative to positive. She helped me financially because my parents couldn’t afford shit. My parents love me but they shouldn’t have had me, they couldn’t afford me and I know having me made their finances way worse because now my dads retired with no money, I’m the only money maker, I pay 1,2000 in rent a month when they only pay 500 because that’s all they can afford. They moved us here after my sister had her baby, but now that she’s gone we barely even see my nephew.\n\nGrowing up I was always ashamed we weren’t like other families, we never went on vacation because it was too expensive too, never had a house so I would lie to people about where I lived because the one time I did tell someone they made fun of me for being poor and living in a town house. I was never able to join a sport or dance or anything because they couldn’t afford it. When I tried joining school sports I was made fun of because I didn’t have the skills the other kids had so I quit and tried telling myself I didn’t like it but in reality I just didn’t have the skills or experience or money to be able to do it.\n\nSince im indigenous, I was always told by my family that people don’t like us because we’re indigenous which was true. People picked on me for my appearance like eyebrows, teeth, eyes, my skin colour or for not having wealthy parents that have a car or money. I had one friend who stuck by me until grade 9 then she started hanging out with her dancer friends and it broke my heart that I was completely shut out. I had a cousin who was my age, she’s always been inconsistent, always looking after her other friends, only ever around me when she didn’t have anyone else to go to.\n\nI’m an admin at an environmental company, my sister helped me get a receptionist job, I climbed the corporate ladder to where I am now but I can’t stop thinking about how irrelevant I am to these companies because my work responsibilities don’t compare to the actual work they do. I feel like a bum.\n\nIn high school I tried as hard as I could but it was always so overwhelming with the amount of courses I had in a semester, tests, homework I couldn’t get solid B’s or A’s always jus a few here and there but they weren’t the courses that mattered so I knew from grade 10 I wouldn’t be able to go to university. I’m in the middle of trying to upgrade my English 12 mark at a local school board but I haven’t wrote in so long that I’m struggling to do the first assignment. I don’t have a positive history with teachers.\n\nWhen I was in grade 5 I was put in a study session with the TA - she worked with kids who were struggling with math. She wasn’t nice to me and I feel like it was because I was indigenous. She got mad at me for using my fingers to count, I didn’t know how to do it so I started writing down my work and she got mad at me again and told me I would never go to university or do anything good with my life because I wasn’t able to do multiplication so I better learn or struggle for life. Ever since then I don’t like asking teachers for help because I’m scared of being ashamed and embarrassed like I was back then. I had a small inch of hope that I could upgrade English, math and science and go to university for an elementary school teacher so I could be a safe spot for kids who struggle with learning, or sonography but the person at the school told me my only shot at getting into the program was because I’m indigenous. I also have been considering accounting for my CPA but I feel too stupid to even think I had a chance at a better career.\n\nI’m sitting at work, I’ve been crying all day and it started because multiple groups formed for lunch and not one group asked me to eat lunch with them or go out for lunch and it’s making me feel like school all over again. I’ve stopped including myself in groups of friends  since high school because I was never truly wanted there. I know if they wanted me there they would ask, I stopped trying to be friends with people who were only my friend because I made the effort to keep it and now that I’ve stopped trying I have no friends and I’ve been telling myself it’s better to be completely alone than to feel alone in a group of people. I just wish people wanted me around\n\nNot to mention I was working on a proposal for work and I came across this “indigenous” section which states they support reconciliation by hiring indigenous staff- so was I only hired so they can look good for the government ?\n\nI just want to die. I know how irrelevant I am, I know how messy this post is but it’s my stupid mind.",

      "title": "CPS notified but we are confused",
      "selftext": "Heya so, first off I probably should say I live outside the US, although i know stories of people with sismilar horrible experiences with 'CPS' in different countries, including US. My post is then also meant mostly to seek some support, because i know advice might not apply for us because of where we live.\n\nSo here's the thing. I (f20) and my partner (m20) are expecting our first kids (30 weeks pregnantL. Yes kids, we are expecting twins! Now we did found that out very quickly (4 weeks) and told some family members at 6 weeks already. During our 8 week echo we found out we were having in fact twins! Although a big change, we were both overwhelmed with joy, although it is safe to say my mil definitely wasnt. She was very harsh when we told her, quite mean and did some things (we dont even know about everything) that later did start causing us troubles. In the meantime she supposedly tried to do better and be behind us as support, however her past actions do have consequences.\n\nOne of the things she did was apply us to a governmental organisation. To try describe it briefly, is that its an irganisation who mainly stands in after kids being born with 10 mandatory checkups to see development, growth, health, ..  In some cases appointments can be done before birth of the kid (so during pregnancy) but this is supposed to be low effort en helping take care of some things (like searching for a midwife, offering advice for parenting choices, signing up kids for nursery, ...). We didn't sign ourselves up for early appointments with this organisation, but we found out later that my mil did. When i was not even 11 weeks pregnant i got a mail from them to schedule a get-to-know-eachother meeting. Thinking at the time it was mandatory and because we thought it couldnt hurt to be prepared, we agreed. we had about 2 appointments, and we needed to cancel our 3rd one because we were very busy with trying to find a new house, kid appointments, preparations, ...\n\nSomething that is important to note: both my partner and me have had mental health issues in the past. we are very stable currently and both in therapy to work on ourselves. With the expecting of our twins, my partner's 'therapist' proposed to do a big meeting in which all people involved in our network and people helping with various things in our lives (therapeutical, doctor, organisation who assisted with school or work traject, ...). Originally this was something we had to apply for and fill in a lot of paperwork (which confused me a lot) and the meeting itself would then be led by an outsider organisation. With all that was happening at the same time (because besides looking for housing on a strict timeline, there were a lot more things going on) we, as autistic people, experienced more stress and pressure from this all than getting something out of it. We therefore requested the therapist and the organisation to pause it for now and let us work on the same things in intimate way with our caretakers and network rather than thag big stressful meeting.\n\nHere's where it went wrong. I dont know exactly what or where it went wrong, but (despite having offered thorough explanations, proof and so on to the organisation) we are now being classified as being uncooperative and a potential danger to our kids because we 'refused to do a big meeting and they are worried about the safety of our kids'. They say to work 'preventive', aka making sure problems cant start and are so worried about the potenti wellfare of our kids that they have reported to the center for childabuse here. So basically CPS. We have attempted nothing more than cooperate, within our own limits and keeping in mind that extra stress is absolutely not good for the kids (and also for ourselves in general) but they still chose to not listen to what we had to say and reported us. The main issue is that this organisation is a recognized governmental organisation with a lot of power. I think you could compare it in the US to CPS feeling like something might be wrong and escalating the entire thing to get their right. So basically, if we arent the picture perfect family now in their investigation (which could take 2-6 months while the twins are expected out in maximum 7 weeks with c-section if they dont get born before than), they will take us to court and basically try removing the kids from us. And if the investigation isn't rounded off in time, there's a realistic chance they could file for temporarily emergency out of house placement from the moment the kids are born because 'they havent been able to proof tbe contrary to the worries yet and they want to make sure of the safety and wellfare of the kids above all'.\n\nIt's all so difficult, especially emotionally and this entire situation is actually making it i feel myself getting worse mentally again. I do want to note that we are not addicted, have never done drugs, have no criminal charges against us, have never been in active psychosis, and officially diagnosed are to the both of us only autism, history of depression years ago, panic disorder years ago, troubles sleeping for which we both took medication for a while and my partner witnessed a traumatic event when they were 8 years old. Any other things we might beb struggling with are simply also not medically recognized or diagnosed officially currently. We are both very much in therapy and looking to expand our therapeutical journey even to be able to process through all events in our childhood, emotion regulation and to become the best version of ourselves both for ourselves, eachother and our kids.\n\nso far i really have no idea who said what and about who of us 2, but its stressing us really out and becoming really difficult. I'm really scared to lose our kids over something that is simply untrue, and is partially because we as autistic people choose to do certain things an alternative way but with the same results (such as intimately preparing with network and caretakers instead of 1 big meeting which causes a lot of stress, worry and overstimulation) and they see that as uncooperative.

      "selftext": "In the 1st year of high school I met the prettiest girl I have ever seen, white, wavy hair, shy, tender and above all kind to me, her name was Yareli, she sang too much in a way that I can't explain, he was nice to her, he gave her compliments, he gave her things, he consoled her when she was sad and she was always pretty, she didn't give me things or anything but she was too calm at her side, I loved being with her, finishing first she told me that she had to go to another school, I was devastated by losing the love of my life but crying I said goodbye to her and I promised that we would see each other again, on her birthday after leaving first year she invited me and some friends to go to the movies, it was wonderful to be by her side we were holding hands we made cute looks at each other, finishing the outing I went to my house and the next day I proposed to her to be my girlfriend even if it was from afar (my first mistake) she left me in sight one day and the next she only sent me a sticker, I was devastated I felt like she was falling my world and I blocked her (my SECOND mistake) from then on we didn't talk until one day Yareli's friend sent me a message, asking me to unblock Yareli because she wanted to talk to me, she spoke to me and after apologizing we didn't talk again until one day she came to my living room without warning, I was still too fond of her and I was very excited about that, so I decided to conquer her, a week after her arrival on a Monday I gave her a surprise kiss on the cheek and another after a while and another and another and another until the exit I said goodbye with a kiss on the cheek, it didn't sound much but it was enlightened and I think she was too, shortly after continuing with our routine of kisses on the cheek I stole one on her mouth it was a magical moment even if it was only for a second I felt it like a lifetime, we loved each other, every day were little glances smiles, sending kisses, kissing her cheeks loving her writing letters to her in the middle of classes and giving her compliments, without a doubt it was beautiful to be with her, all this was for the better (or worse) one day I invited her to my birthday and in a moment alone she proposed to me on my birthday, I was delighted to accept, on May 28 (23 days after we were dating) I was with her my brother sees me and for some reason I pushed her (my third mistake) or I know if it was instinct or I don't know but I broke her heart and she left with her friend, she never told me that was why she felt bad, she never told me why She felt like there was no communication on her part, I apologized too much and she just said okay ntp, I think that's where it all started, the whole week I felt strange after that we were normal but with less looks on her part less love on her part, it wasn't so noticeable but it hurt me, from that everything was very good we loved each other she gave me letters and one day she talked to me about how she missed Juan (almost something) I felt bad and she told me that she was mean to him and that she wanted to be his friend and I felt bad, very bad because I felt that I missed her love, I told her about it and she told me that nothing was going to happen, from then on almost everything was about him, until one day she went out with him and I told her that I had felt very bad, very insecure and I vented to her and she told me \"it would be better to end it\" I prayed that that would not happen roge and roge but it was inevitable when I entered the third year of high school, I proposed to her and asked her for a SECOND chance to which She accepted and we went well although I felt bad because she sent letters to Juan, messages through her friend Enrique and gifts, but all of that behind my back I only saw how it happened but if I asked she didn't tell me anything, one day checking her phone I found several chats, one with her friend who said \"your ex doesn't delete the highlights\" and she said \"ash I know, how stupid\" another with a guy to whom she said cielito (I don't remember about her chat, only that she said things like that) and the other that broke my heart where on May 9, when we were dating, I had a chat with another person with very loving things and I never said anything about that because I didn't want to break up with her, this week it all ended she was making me cry every day with how she treated me, she treated me like shit and Juan with special treatment and today I asked her why it was like that and she ended up saying why I was very \"shrill\" I don't know whose fault it is the truth is this is super poorly worded it's just that I was looking for a way not to keep everything to myself",

So I met this guy, we share the same interests, have a group of people who know us. We've seen each other once in a while in this company of friends, he invited me home. I went a couple of times, it was nice, we talked and there was no real sexual or romantic subtext. But once I've stopped by and we kinda had a spark, kissed and foreplayed (sorry, if it's not correct, I'm not a native speaker). It was fun and very tender, but I said, that sex will ruin our relationship and it's not perfect, we have the same friend group etc. Well but the next day I thought about it a lot, and it seemed like a good idea to have sex. So I told him, and we went for it. But it was so bad for so many reasons. There was no real connection, I don't really know, why, the sex itself was not ideal, he lost an erection a couple of times, because (apparently) I tried to say, what I like in bed (spoiler: he didn't do it anyway). And it was like essentially five minutes or so, just him basically using me instead of a hand or something. After that he told me \"You are a bitch, because I fucked you\" and that was especially gross, I guess. So I went home and I really feel used and disgusted. I was in the shower for like 15 minutes, trying to wash it off, but I still feel dirty and broken. I gave consent, but it still feels awful. I don't know, why I do this to myself, I want to cry, get drunk (I am sober for 4 years) or walk out of the window at the same time. But instead I'm writing this. Stupid me, I guess. I can't even tell anyone about this is such a detail, because I don't want to feel pity or see a dissapointemt or contempt in their eyes. It sucks. I don't know what to do, to be honest. I can even look at myself in the mirror.\nThanks for reading. ",

      "selftext": "TW: assault / rape / trauma / depression / family issues\n\n( I just created this acc abt an hour ago just to post this so please give me advice if you can)\n\nDecember 13th 2023, my former best friend introduced me to a guy she had just met. At first, everything seemed normal, but later that evening, things took a very dark turn. He crossed boundaries and hurt me in a way I can’t fully describe here. It was the most terrifying experience of my life, and it still haunts me. Now everybody in town knows what happened and I feel like everybody just knows who I am bc of what happened.\n\nAfter it happened, my friend chose to stay in contact with him and eventually cut me off completely. That broke my heart in a different way, losing someone I trusted when I needed her the most.\n\nSince then, I’ve been struggling with depression. I started using unhealthy ways to cope, just trying to make the pain quieter. My dad found nic again in my room 3 days ago. (In July I promised that I am going to quit). My dad found out a couple of times and before he was angry but then came around after knowing why I do it. but instead of being angry like before, he’s just.. silent. He doesn’t talk to me anymore. It’s like he gave up on me, and that hurts more than I can explain. I don’t really feel at home in my own family right now.\n\nI’ve been going to therapy every week, but sometimes I still can’t bring myself to talk about certain things like I freeze when I try. I know I need help, but I don’t always know how to ask for it.\n\nI guess I’m just hoping someone here understands. I’m tired of feeling broken, tired of pretending I’m okay. I just want to feel like myself again someday.\n\nThanks for reading if you made it this far. ❤️",

I don’t approach people, I don’t try to make friends, and I just don’t do much. I know these things are within my control, but it’s so hard to change them.\n\nI’m really trying to work on myself, but it’s going to take a lot of time and effort. I just want to love someone, and I want someone to love me back. I want to be able to kiss, hug, and cuddle with someone, and just be a happy couple. I’m friends with a bunch of couples, and it’s always a bit of a downer when we hang out. Everyone gets to go home with their partner, except for me.\n\nI wish I could suppress these feelings whenever they come up, but it’s so hard to do that every single day.

He basically wanted me to flirt with his younger male employees (like grads, kind of shy IT guys) and get compromising pics. He even said where they’d be drinking and what hotel they’d be staying at, and that I could pick which ones to approach by looking them up online.\n\nI left as soon as I could but I’ve felt so gross since. Just disturbed. I can’t believe Luke brought me into that. When I said it didn’t feel okay, he just said, “that’s what rich guys do.”\n\nI don’t even know.

I also want to just start being more open around campus with people by saying hi to strangers passing by or who sit next to me in the dining hall or library. I may try to strike up a conversation and get to know them if they are receptive to it.\n\nI know there will be people that I might make uncomfortable but if that happens I will just walk away and try to find someone else who is open to connect.

Usually it’s boring, forgettable, and nothing to write about.\n\nBut this time? This turned into full-blown absurdist theater.\n\nThe owner’s team went into overdrive. First, a lady appeared, introduced herself as some sort of representative, quoted laws at me… and then, in the same breath, forwarded me the very number she claimed should never be used. Protect - but actually broadcast.\n\nThen came Jon. The “right hand.” Instead of calming things down, he doubled down. He forwarded the details again. All I wanted was peace - to kick the owner’s personal data out of my head and move on. I asked him to stop contacting me, to just leave me alone. Instead, he twisted it into something else: mocking me, blackmailing me, even telling me to give up my career. How do you get from “leave me alone” to “you should quit your job”? Not even talking about the crime of spreading the owner’s data.\n\nAnd he kept the chat alive against my will- even after I told him I’d complain about his behavior to the very authorities he was threatening me with. All because I once contacted the owner, and now he’s the one disturbing my peace.\n\nSo let’s do the math \n1 contact \nAgainst constant circle of spreading everyone’s personal data followed by blackmail and libel \n\nThe funniest part? The boss’s original complaint was that he didn’t want to be disturbed. But thanks to his own team, his name and number became unforgettable. If Lewis Carroll wrote a business parable, it would look exactly like this. \n\nAfter this incident I clearly remember the owner’s phone number, his name, what car he drives, where I can find him in Dubai and etc. Don’t think I’m going to chase him no- he just occupied my brain for days, and that’s why now I need to get him off my chest.\n",

He/She got my photo when I am quite private and don't let people I don't know add on my social media. So, they have to be pretty close to get my photo and then to use the AI to create a vulgar photo of mine\n\n2. After I didn't act on their provocation they sent request to a close friend and my friendship is quite low key and not many people know that I am good friends with her.\n\nI filled a police complaint and suspiciously they suddenly changed the id name and the police are so useless they couldn't do anything and the id was just left like that.\n\nWhat's odd the Instagram id is private and there's no following or followers. It only sent me a follow request and after I didn't react it only sent that friend a request.\n\nNow suddenly after a year it posted 6 posts on its account. It's still private and has no followers one following. I feel so disturbed. Just tell me what you want damn it. Everything sucks. I don't know their agenda or what they want or how are they benefitting from it. The thought it's someone close to me is also so terrible and exhausting.",

      "title": "F25 I’ve become a bitter person because I’m jealous of those working in creative fields when I feel that option was never a viable one for me :/",
      "selftext": "For a while now I have felt even more lost that usual. I keep seeing friends and acquaintances pursuing creative careers like movie producing and directing and painting and design and fashion (or in creative adjacent fields like pr where they are engaging with creativity constantly). \n\nGrowing up I was always very creative doing art, crafts, drama etc. Drama specifically was something I always wanted to pursue and I felt I had potential but felt it always felt out of reach (not realistic, not stable, I have no connections, grew up struggling for money so was never treated as a viable choice by those around me, I was shy as a kid, I was told I was pretty enough but not special or eye catching - overall I felt like I was constantly being told, not necessarily in words, that I don’t have the wow factor needed). Now, seeing people I know successfully pursue these fields makes me feel heart broken for my younger self that I didn’t grind regardless of how out of reach it felt. \n\nI’ve spent my time post uni trying to figure out a ‘realistic’ path I could go down makes me feel like i’ve wasted time. I have tried for over a year to get a job in the realm of mental health and hopefully over the course of years pursue a counselling psychology doctorate so I can practice. However, I now feel like someone as unhappy with their choices and as confused should probably work on that before counselling others lmao. The field of mental health/psychology now seems just as hard to get into as film did when I was younger, leaving me feeling silly for not having just gone for it. \n\nI tried to communicate these feelings of confusion for what I want to my family who found it hard to reconcile with the fact that I may want to pursue drama, something I found little success in and haven’t practiced or studied in years. It made me wish I had the confidence to do so when I was younger - so now as an adult I decided to just go for it and go to classes. I went and I really enjoyed it and though I felt rusty and anxious and scared, it didn’t feel wrong. I can’t really describe how it felt but i’ll try: it felt like I was doing something good for myself h th at other people wouldn’t understand and so I felt I should keep it to myself. To this day, I don’t feel I have the confidence to tell anyone about my secret ambitions and dreams (likely due to the discouraging reaction I got when younger highlighting how few people ‘make it’). \n\nI am now finding it hard to be happy for these people that I know, and overall I think this feeling taking over me has left me feeling bitter and resentful. I’m still interested in psychology and mental health but I cannot shake the jealous feeling of k owing someone else has carved a path for themselves in a creative field and is in it successfully. I am unsure how to move forward from this feeling and what direction to take in terms of career. Whilst creative or not both seem competitive, the time and money and effort I’ve spent into getting academic qualifications in the Psych field would feel wasted if I suddenly decided to pursue creative (combined with the sinking feeling that nothing will come of it and it will be a pitiful waste that others discuss between talks of their own successes in creative fields). Any advice or anyone on the same boat who knows how to make it easier to get through the day carrying these feelings - it will be very appreciated. Anyone feeling the same, i’m sorry as I know how debilitating and shameful it can feel, hopefully we find support and comfort in the shared journey \n",

      "selftext": "I (20F) work in a corporate environment dominated mostly by men. To be precise, most of them are middle-aged and already married with kids. However, there are a few younger men around my age (the youngest being 26)\n\nIt’s been less than a year since I joined the company, and when I first started, I had a mentor who was assigned to train me. He was married with children, but he still acted oddly toward me.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, I know some people are just friendly by nature. But in a conservative country, you don’t comment on a girl’s body, especially when she’s fully covered, or say that you miss her scent. That’s just not how it goes.\n\nFast forward a month later, I moved to a new branch due to transportation and other issues. Despite that, he kept in touch and started asking me personal questions outside of work. He even mentioned that he always deletes his messages, which made it clear he knew it was wrong.\n\nI set boundaries and moved on.\n\nIn my new workplace, I was still feeling depressed after the awful experience in my previous one. I just tried to act composed. Still, somehow, an intern started pursuing me. I found it strange, hard to believe, even. Yes, I’m the youngest person there, but I’m always covered up. I even wear a mask. I’m not exactly pretty, just average. Very average. And I’m not saying this to seek pity or compliments. I’m simply average. Besides, when half your face is covered, how do you even “fall” for someone like that?\n\nThe internship ended, and I tried to cut ties. It wasn’t easy, but I couldn’t allow a moment of vulnerability to ruin my composure.\n\nAnyway, I’m over all that now. I’m an admin assistant to two managers who always find something to scold me about. All I’ve ever wanted was to prove that I’m capable. I was finally making progress and starting to get some praise, until today, I heard, “My mom wants to know you better, is that okay?”\n\nThat sentence caught me off guard. It’s basically a subtle proposal, and it came from a coworker on my own team.\n\nI don’t know what expression I had at that moment, but I hoped it wasn’t something repulsive.\n\nIt might not sound bad to you, but to give some context, I was molested throughout my childhood. So being seen that way, constantly, never fails to make me nauseous.\n\nWhat makes it worse is that this coworker was always helpful, extremely helpful and respectful. But now, all I can do is doubt his intentions.\n\nHow on earth do I fix this? I’m not a pick-me, and I speak formally to everyone, even my female coworkers. \n\nHow miserable.\n",

      "selftext": "I'm in my 40s and have been pretty free of big family drama over my lifetime. Everyone is pretty chill and logical. We're all decent communicators. The big drama has mostly been with extended family and hasn't impacted me directly. I've been pretty lucky, until recently.\n\nBut now drama's bubbling up with my aunt. I always knew if family drama was going to arise, she would be involved. Extended family drama often involves her. Plus, she and I have just never been on the same page.\n\nShe was named executor of my mother's estate after my mother passed away several years ago. To her credit, she did an awesome job with many of those responsibilities. But when it comes to my mom's home, it's been a mess. My sister and I (only beneficiaries) don't live near where my mother lived when she died, so it was easier to let my aunt (retired) handle whatever needed to be done. Besides, that's what an executor does. We trusted her to take care of the home because she'd taken care of everything else so well.\n\nWhen the home hadn't sold after a few years, I asked \"What is going on here?\" Vague answers led to stonewalling. It turned out she'd never put it on the market. There's been a cornucopia of excuses for why not. In the meantime she was renting the home and acting as a landlord. She believes that's her responsibility as an executor. I'm pretty sure it's not. I told her to tell the tenant that we'll sell when the lease is up. That was a few years ago and my aunt just keeps renewing the lease behind my back and not making any progress to sell the home. I don't even know anything about the tenant/contract/etc.\n\nRecently I chatted with her about it again (it's really the only thing we talk about anymore) and she told me about some outstanding issue preventing a sale. It didn't add up to me, so I talked to a lawyer who dug around a little and told me there are no obstacles to selling and that my sister and I are listed as the owners.\n\nSo now I have to deal with this and at least I am legally sound. I have to juggle my work and my own family with this situation 2,000 miles from home to sort out an issue that should've been resolved ten years ago. It's stressing me out.\n\nWhy is my aunt doing this? Why would someone drag out being an estate executor for over a decade? I think she feels like this home is still a connection to my mother. Also, being a landlord probably gives my aunt some sense of purpose in her retirement. But I'm sure she can find something else to occupy the miniscule amount of time that this takes to handle.",

Nowadays, I can be more normal, I can adapt, I often make a very positive impression on people, and many admire me. \n\nYet, inside, I myself am less able to love in return, even when I have the opportunity, because now so many people seem to want to love me. To some extent. And I no longer long for love as devastatingly as I did as a child. I can't love them back because their love is not worthy of the love for my true self, I see that now. As they got to know me, they would become disillusioned, they would be frightened of me, of my otherness, as they got closer.\n\n  \nI still yearn to believe in everything as I did before, to not have to question and redefine it all.

But nope, I’m so fucking pathetically out of control with my weight that I could go>! nearly two days!< without food and STILL gain weight. Like a goddamn medical miracle in all of the worst ways. I almost wish I had some horrible fucking fast growing tumor, just so this humiliating failure wasn’t all my fault. \n\nThank God the nurse wrote down my numbers without commenting because I know if she mentioned my weight gain, that would’ve been my thirteenth reason. As though I don’t already want to kick out my second story window enough right now. I feel fucking sick with myself. After getting home and nearly stress vomiting, I weighed myself on my own scale and yep, still >!145 pounds.!< Then I walked to my friend’s place and used his scale and got the same result. There’s no glitch or error or breakdown of circuits that I can blame for my weight, just my stupid fucking self. Just me, the pathetic fucking mess who binged his way to a new highest ever weight. From >!119 to 145 pounds,!< >!BMI 15.1 to 18.4!<, >!severe thinness to BARELY underweight. !<\n\nSo now I’m fucking spiraling. I >!binge-purged!< in public for the first time in years, the first time since I got my front teeth fully re-done. I’ve thrown out most of the food in the fridge, anything my roommates wouldn’t give a shit about. I googled the calories counts of every medication I’ve taken over the past month, just in case painkillers did this to me. I gave my box of razors and other sharp things to my roommate because I’ve been making eyes at my wrists. It’s been hard even existing in a house with a kitchen because God, my thoughts are all doom and gloom and unimaginable self-directed violence. Every time I pass the kitchen, I can’t help thinking that it would be so fucking nice to do an at-home attempt at liposuction. I took a meat cutting course, I know I could figure it out. Fat is fat and I know how to remove it, whether it’s off a cut of meat or my own thighs.\n\nI’m not going to kill myself. Or attempt a mix between surgery and butchery that’ll hospitalize and/or kill me. Embarrassingly, because if I survived the attempt, I think admitting that I tried to kill myself over weight gain is a humiliation I’m not prepared for. Unembarrassingly, because if I succeeded, it would fucking devastate my loved ones and I won’t do that to them. Not over something that doesn’t have to doom me. But God, am I desperately fucking yearning with all that I am to get back to my lowest weight before this pushes me over.\n\n",

      "selftext": "This has been driving me crazy for a while now and I feel like I don't have anyone to talk to about it. We both work and we both have a good amount of credit card debt, in the 10 thousands. I know, I know, it's stupid but we came up with a plan for each of us to get it all paid off before the end of next year without it seriously affecting our day-to-day lives. It'll require following a budget, being strict with ourselves and not making any frivolous purchases.\n\nWe started 2 months ago and have been trucking along with it. All of a sudden my wife starts asking about taking expensive trips, buying expensive tickets to shows, wanting to make reservations every other week to fancy restaurants, buying shit she doesn't NEED. Then she complains about not having any money and being anxious about our finances. I told her it's because she's not following the plan and keeps wanting to live outside of our agreed upon budget. She always claps back with one of two responses, \"I don't want to live my life sitting at home all day and not ever doing anything\" and \"What's the point in having money if we can never use it.\" I told her this is temporary, we both have way better jobs now then we used to when we first racked up the debt. Once this is paid off we can take trips, buy fun stuff if we want, go to shows, whatever. I don't want to do all those things with this cloud of anxiety constantly around my head because of this debt.\n\nShe gets defensive and it turns into an argument. She sees all her friends posting about fun stuff they're doing and gets fomo, and I understand! I want to do that stuff too! I'd love to go to France for a week, or go to a music festival, or buy fun toys whenever I want but for right now we can't! Eventually she calms down and agrees with me. We go back to the plan only for the same argument to come up later.\n\nI don't know how else to talk to her about it without it turning into a fight. Whenever she sends me a link to a show/event or a video about some influencer on a vacation I say \"We'll see! Maybe we can budget for it next time\" or \"Hopefully we can do that next year!\" Queue the same argument. We also want to be able to own a house eventually, get cars that aren't 10 years old and starting to fall apart, have kids one day. I want to be able to do that without this debt always in the back of my mind.\n\nIs it me? Am I too hyper focused on this? Am I being too strict with our lives? I don't know anymore.\n\nEDIT: Wanted to give some context. The budget/plan accounted for still being able to do fun stuff which are the following:\n\n* A show/event once every month or 2 (depending on ticket prices)\n* A modest vacation once or twice a year (must be under $2k for flight/hotel combined so no luxury hotels or European getaways)\n* Eating out a couple of times a month (frequency depends on type of restaurant)\n* Grocery shopping has not changed at all this remains the same\n* Limit on buying clothes/items that we don't NEED\n\nEver since we both got new jobs and increased salaries my wife wants to spend MORE. So more expensive vacations, expensive seats to shows that she wants to go to 3 times a months, booking 5 star restaurants that'll run us $300+ for just the two of us, buying $300 worth of clothes in one week, stuff like that.",

Even the entry positions want 2-5 years experience. Others want 15. So, I guess I should’ve went into this field when I was in high school. Not only did I study this, I have transferable skills that are applicable. So, I started looking for other retail work and have been rejected at every turn. It makes it feel pointless to have 11 years of experience if I’m “unqualified” for everything. \n\nMeanwhile, I’m stuck at a job I loved but the conditions have left me hanging on by a thread. My boss goes out of her way to protect a coworker who takes advantage of her passiveness at every turn. A lot of times, it feels like I’m carrying the job on my own. I’ve gone round and round with her about what’s going on, only for it to get spun around. Somehow it’s my fault or I’m too stupid to realize what’s going on. Seriously. I’d like quit if it wasn’t such a big risk. \n\nI’m just so exhausted. I’ve been trying to leave this position for almost a year with no prospects. As I said, everything I’ve done makes me question the point. Apparently I’m unqualified for everything. Or is the universe trying to tell me to Scotland and that’s why nothing else is working. Just let me dream that’s what the universe is telling me because I can’t make sense of it. ",

By all accounts I should be in a good place but it all feels fake. Maybe not my marriage but my friendships certainly do. I'm brought back to my childhood often where I would sit alone in my room for hours just talking to my stuffed animals. It's so much worse now because I'm an adult and have no one to talk to. I just feel like somethings have to be left unsaid to my loved ones because I don't want them to worry. I'm not going to do anything stupid. I'm really messed up mentally with anxiety and stress they know that but there are deeper fears I can't even bring myself to express because I'm afraid, so terribly afraid, that if I do they'll all leave me behind. I have really bad abandonment issues even though no one has ever really abandoned me. My only thought is subconsciously I must have seen a pattern. I just feel so alone and I hate it.

      "selftext": "I don't have a single baby picture of myself. Not one. By the time i was old enough to ask \"why\", I already knew the answer. My mom left me in Nigeria before i turned one. She visited, at most, two weeks a year until i moved to the States at 13. I grew up invisible, sometimes, abused, and almost died of a chronic illness when i was nine. When i finally joined my parents in U.S, i thought things would get better. They got worse\n\nMy parents always wanted a son. My sisters and I were never enough. That inadequacy was unspoken but constant, a weight we carried in silence.\n\nYears later, they adopted a boy - the son they always wanted. Today, that boy is back in Nigeria, where its \"cheaper\" to raise a kid, while my parents continue to live comfortably in America. They are doing to him what they did to me, and I have no power to stop the cycle.\n\nThey never supported me emotionally and barely financially. The day before my first day of college, my mom was supposed to take me shopping for supplies. instead, she went to a party. I cried my heart out, and my parents ignored me. The next day, i was sent off to school with no hug, no encouragement, no acknowledge that i was beginning a new chapter of my life.\n\nDepression followed me through college. I paid out of pocket for therapy before my mom did not sign the form that would have put me under her health insurance. My dad refused to cosign a student loan. Till today, i still wonder why.\n\nDuring breaks, i stayed in empty dorm - even on thanksgiving. I worked summer jobs that allowed me to remain on campus because campus was more home than home ever was.\n\nAfter graduation, i crashed with a friend because my mom and I weren't speaking. At one point, she even turned my sisters against me. I'd never felt so completely alone.\n\nSo i built a life anyway. I eventually created the stability i never had - a home, a family, a future i could count on. I did it without their encouragement, without their financial support, without a safety net. And somehow, that made me strong enough to survive, but not strong enough to let go.\n\nIn my culture, there's an unspoken rule: Parents give you life, so you owe them everything, forever. There's no word for \"boundaries\" - only \"duty\". Questioning this means you're selfish. Ungrateful. A bad child.\n\nBut what do you owe parents who were never really there?\n\nNow that I'm older and \"successful\", they are more \"accepting\" of me and act nicer when i give them money - but it's never enough. Love has always been conditional. Any money has always been the measure.\n\nBut i have a family of my own to support now. I have financial obligations. I want to make sure I'm secure in my own old age so I'll never have to depend on my children the way my parents depend on theirs. I don't want to keep giving money that goes unappreciated. I don't want to keep hearing about \"other children\" who supposedly do more for their parents.\n\nI feel trapped between obligation, guilt, and wanting peace. I want to cut ties, but cultural pressure and guild keep me stuck. I dread the unknown aftermath, the judgement and silent treatment from other family members, the possibility that walking away might bring me peace, but also pain I'm not yet ready to face.\n\nI don't know how to move forward. This is my cry for help. Thanks for letting me get this off my chest.",

      "title": "I'm not sure if my SO loves me anymore ...",
      "selftext": "Hi,\n\n\n\nSo ... This is my first time writing something on Reddit. English isn’t my first language. I apologize for any mistake I may make and I hope you can understand what I am saying ... \n\nThis is a long one, I am sorry ... But I feel like I need to explain a lot.\n\n\n\nI (34F) have been with my SO (35F) for 17 years. I was 16, she was 17 and the Internet brought us together. One year and two coming out later, we started dating and since then, it's me and her against the World. She is my first love and I always think of her as my One and Only.\n\n\n\nBefore I continue, some background informations :\n\nI have had some mental health problems (mostly depression) since my teenage years at least, and it has been a struggle for most of my life. I have been in therapy for one year, when I was in middle school, because my parents were breaking up after cheating on each other. When I felt better, I stopped going, thinking that was the end of it.\n\n\n\nThat was not.\n\n\n\nYears after years, my mental health has severely deteriorated and, at that time, I didn’t know why. I went back into therapy, tried ADs too ... I felt better again but it didn’t last. Every time, it was worse. I didn’t know what to do so I just kept going forward with my life, hoping to find an answer along the way.\n\n\n\nSO was aware of my mental health problems very early in our relationship. She was so supportive, has always been. We moved together, adopted (too) many cats. We did struggle, mostly for financial reasons, but we were together, deeply in love with each other and that was all that mattered.\n\n\n\nTime has passed but my mental health has not improved. After years of struggle, years of searching for the reasons why I was the way I was, I ended severely depressed, really anxious, struggling with a compulsive eating disorder, in poor physical health and unemployed. I felt like I was at rock bottom. I didn’t know what I wanted to do with my life and sometimes, I didn’t even know if I wanted to continue living ... I was really tired and tried to hurt myself several times ...\n\nBut SO was always here. So supportive, so patient and kind with me ... I will always be grateful to her for being there, all this time.\n\n\n\nOur situation did improve a little with time. SO got a job she truly loves, we moved to a nice sunny city with our baby cats not-so-baby-anymore, with the hope of getting married and starting a family ...\n\nBut my mental health did not improve ... Until last summer.\n\n\n\nI was diagnosed with ADHD by my psychiatrist and started taking new medications.\n\nThe improvements were really quick and visible ! I'm doing better and I feel like I've finally started living ... After more than 20 years of ups and downs. It’s pretty strange.\n\nI'm trying to come to terms with the fact that I've been unknowingly disabled for most of my life. I am still learning all of this ... It’s hard, not gonna lie, but I feel ... Alive. I don't feel guilty for being me anymore.\n\n\n\nBack to the present, now:\n\nAfter all this time, I think SO’s patience and support for me has, maybe, disappeared ... She doesn’t seem to believe I really have ADHD.\n\nRecently, I have had severe insomnia and I am quite tired at the moment. I asked for help from my psychiatrist and my therapist, we are working on it but fatigue doesn't just go away, even if I really want it to.\n\n\n\nYesterday, me and SO were supposed to go out together for the first time in a while but I started feeling sick. I was nauseous and really tired, suddenly ... My chest started to hurt a little and I was feeling kind of out of breath. I couldn’t go, I didn’t have the strength anymore. Yet, it was me who suggested we go out and I was really, really excited. I felt bad, like I was the worst ...\n\nWhen I said to her that I couldn’t go because I didn’t feel well enough, she sighed and started talking to me more harshly. She looked really disappointed, almost angry.\n\nI told her to go without me. She worked pretty hard these past few days and I knew she needed to take a break. I was okay with her going out without me but I guess she wasn't. It was with me or not at all ...\n\n\n\nI started to be a little angry but mostly, I was feeling guilty. I wanted to go out, I wanted to spend time with her too but she seemed to believe that I didn’t want to, that I pretended to be sick to avoid it.\n\nIn the past, I did this kind of thing so it isn’t out of the blue ... But I did apologize and now, I am trying really hard to change my bad habits and to change myself for the better. For me and for her, for our future together.\n\n\n\nShe started becoming more harsh a few months ago, maybe ... I’m not sure exactly when but I did remember some tense moments, mostly when I had to do things and I didn’t feel able to do them (medical or professional appointments, shopping for our meals, going with her to the vet ...).\n\n\n\nMaybe I'm too late. Maybe she is just tired of me and doesn’t trust me anymore. Maybe I let her down too many times and her love for me has faded ... I don’t know.\n\n\n\nWe plan to talk this out when she comes back from work but I’m not sure what to say or to do ... I can’t resolve myself to be angry at her, not after all she did for me over the years.\n\n\n\nI’m not sure where I am anymore ...",

When I confronted her, she admitted it had been going on for months, even before the wedding. I can’t explain the feeling. Anger, disbelief, sadness it’s all hitting at once. What hurts even more is knowing how much I gave to this relationship. I built a business, a home, a future I thought we’d share. She moved into my house before we got married and now I can’t even look at her without feeling sick. I don’t care about the money right now. I just feel betrayed and completely lost.

Very unstable, alcoholism, untreated mental health issues, etc. That all went away when I was born. I think it's because she waited so long to have me.\n\nThe switch flipped. I didn't get parented the same; she was very overbearing and overprotective instead. I couldn't go to the shop alone until I was fourteen. On the other side, my father (40M) was a drug addict with bipolar, in and out of prison, and distant. \n\nI was hit as a child. My first beer was at 3 years old, and there are photos of it. I began smoking at 12, I self-harmed at 13 and tried to commit suicide multiple times from 14 through to 17. I became addicted to stimulants and alcohol, I smoke weed all the time. I have bipolar disorder, autism and adhd, depression and anxiety. I can't get a job, I can't talk to strangers, I'm uncomfortable with affection because I was smothered, yet I crave it because I wanted it from my father too.

I feel as if I'm being selfish for existing.\n\nMy siblings should've gotten what I have, with our mother and their father instead. They deserved to have our mother as kind as she is now, with their father. \n\nI'm their half-brother, yet they treat me no different. They love me, and I love them; but I can't help but think that deep down, they don't like me all that much for how I am.\n\nI wish my sister never told me that. I carry the burden of knowing that I couldn't be what our mother wanted me to be, and that my siblings weren't supposed to be here because of it. \n\nI don't know. Maybe I'm overthinking it. I just had to get it out of me.\n\n",

I thought he hated him (even though I never did anything to him) but I heard from a few friends that he has been talking about me and saying how he wanted to reconnect with me before moving away.

We’re selling some stuff, cutting back hard, and I’ve already told my boss I’ll stay on past when I planned to leave.

I was a pretty standout athlete esp with my height 6'6'' and some decent muscle, could of really gone to college for football basketball or track if im being honest.\n\nAnyway after sorta leaving the other sports behind to dedicate on football only, I guess I started realizing its not as much of a dream as I wanted. Its a great sport and theres some really great dudes but its exhausting what it takes to stay here and is really taking a toll. Vs my high school self Ive got pushed to make alot of changes, especially alot of eating and adding a lot of weight that I can feel how non healthy it is. Im slower n joints hurt and feel kinda hooked on the food too atp. All the partying wit the team is getting old to. I just feel like this is suppose to be my dream but basicly its like all I do is practice eat party repeat, I even have a smoke show girlfriend whose amazing but idk im just kind of all glazed over it at this point and now im typing this wit some millers and reeeses halloween things feeling like a fatass regretting stuff idk",

The reason I'm making this post is suddenly when I was 7 I moved to the Uk and suddenly life was extremely different, at first I enjoyed all the unlimited access I had to the internet and all the amazing things I was able to do, but by some point towards my late teenage years I became burnt out, and started to miss those early years where I lived like the earlier decade did, and due to my age I struggle to find anyone my age who shares in the same nostalgia, so I often find myself reading anecdotes about the \"good ol' days\" from 30-40 year olds online and find myself wishing I had never moved countries as a kid or wishing I was born a decade or two earlier. \n\nBasically, I'm another dude who misses the \"good ol' days\" and spend a lot of my time wishing I could get those simpler days back, both the benefits of being a child and having the entire world be what was only in front of my eyes.

As soon as I opened the door and got out, he approached me and kept telling me how sorry he was. I was still very angry and hurt, so I didn’t say much.\n\nWhen I walked inside, he led me to our room. It was spotless; the cleanest I think I’ve ever seen it. He showed me that he had tried to put the jewelry box back together. I know he did his best, but there were pieces missing, and the glass from the doors was shattered. I just looked at him and said, “Thank you.” I didn’t complain or say anything else because I knew what would happen if I did.\n\nApparently, though, I wasn’t enthusiastic enough, because he got annoyed almost immediately. He started calling me ungrateful. I told him that he couldn’t undo what he did, and that’s when he became irate. His mom was at work, so I didn’t really have any backup. But his little sister was home.\n\nAfter he started yelling, he grabbed my jewelry box again and took it outside, shouting that I was ungrateful and didn’t deserve him. His six-year-old little sister heard us yelling and followed me outside. We both watched as he threw the jewelry box onto the concrete, smashing it worse than before, and then picked up several pieces and put them in his pocket.\n\nI started crying again and fell to my knees beside the remnants. His little sister came over to comfort me and told me that she loves me more than she loves him, that her big brother was really mean. I told her that I loved her too, but she shouldn’t say things like that, especially while he could still be listening. She nodded and helped me pick up the shards of wood and glass.\n\nI told him I wanted to leave. At first, he called my bluff and said, “Fine, leave then.” But when I texted my dad that I needed him to come get me and he realized what I’d done, he lost it. He started crying uncontrollably, took my phone, and texted my dad back pretending to be me saying it was all a misunderstanding, that everything was okay, and that we’d worked it out.\n\nAfter that, he spent probably four hours talking to me, telling me he was going to be better, that he was sorry, but also pointing out all the things I do that are “wrong” or “shitty.”\n\nI think tonight was the first time I really looked at him and knew that this is going to be over. I don’t know when or how yet, but I know this is not going to be the rest of my life",

Most of us were in our late 20s or early 30s, and we all had kids or jobs, so we kind of gravitated toward each other as most everyone else was just starting their lives.\nOne of the nights when we were studying at one of the guys houses we all randomly got a text from the same number that none of us had the contact for. It was something along the lines of \"I know what you are doing\" and they listed out all of our names. The weird thing about it is I hadn't given my number out to anyone outside of the study group (they only invited me into it because I knew the subject, otherwise I am VERY shy). \nWe weren't being secretive about the study group, but we weren't exactly telling people about it because we wanted to keep it smaller to stay very focused. It was also just nice to study with people who had similar mindsets about school and goals. \nI'm generally very inclusive, and I did feel bad about not inviting our other classmates, but we usually studied at one of the guys houses and I couldn't really invite people over to someone else's house. I felt bad that someone felt so excluded to go that far, and also am glad that whoever it was was not in the study group.\nAnyway, I reverse searched the number several times and never figured out who it belonged to. It wasn't exactly threatening just creepy. I still think about it occasionally and wonder who did it and how they got everyone's numbers and information.",

I didn't want to call it rape at the time.

Insulted me, called me horrible things and even insinuated I was going to abuse from child support because he's \"rich\". \n\nHe even got jealous of my two male friends during pregnancy and at the same time saying he didn't want to be with me and insinuated I was having something with any of them. \n\nWhen I lost the baby he was in a trip, I even begged him to stay here with me and the baby, he told me he wanted some calm and went to Europe. I lost my baby and when he knew about it he came back to the country. Why? He has been feeling guilty since. Even now, he has told me that he feels frustrated for how he acted but he decided to go on boys trip and telling me he's feeling terrible. \n\nI've insisted him about divorce and he's been like \"why? Do you want to get marry again?\" and things like that to not file for divorce while planning moving to other country and even trying to flirt with me.\n\nToday I brought up the divorce thing and he was like \"I refuse to do it\" I have even told him I want to be au pair in order to improve my English level (26 is the age limit and I'll be 26 in March) and he doesn't care. \n\nHe's been like \"I do still love you but I can't be with you\" and bs like that.\n\nOn his head he's like \"maybe in other country he'd feel better about us\" and the 🤡 thinks I'm going to leave my life here to be with him or maybe continue being married in case we got back together in the future.

      "selftext": "Not sure if this is the right subreddit for this but here it goes anyway.\n\nListen, I've had some really bad weeks in my life (the week of my mothers death earlier this year being the big one). But this week has been really and truly rough.\n\nFor context; My roommate (brother) and I just moved to a ground floor apartment in July. It's a really nice and secluded spot that backs up to a tree line with a little man made pond. Its nice and quiet and has little to no foot traffic. Fast forward to this past Sunday morning.\n\nSunday: I work third shift and was coming home, ready to just crawl into bed. My roommate was spending the night with their girlfriend so no one was home overnight apart from the cat. I walk into the apartment and immediately feel something is off. I walk down the entry hallway to discover the back sliding and screen doors are wide open. The living room was a mess and my mind processes the fact that this wasn't my roommates doing, I had just been robbed. My first thought is the cat, I rush outside and call his name, luckily he came back right away and was unharmed.\n\nThen I check our bedrooms. They are trashed. boxes and tote bins open and dumped out, drawers and shelves overturned, items thrown about the room, skeins of yarn literally leading from my room to their exit point. I called my brother, waking them up, and he and my brothers girlfriend rushed over. The cops were called and a report was given.\n\nThe \"big\" missing items were of course electronics. My ps4, my microphone and some games, my roommates ps5, camera's games laptop, tablet all stolen. As mentioned above my mom passed away unexpectedly earlier this year and I inherited some of her jewelry. One of them was a ring with my birthstone on it that my mom had purchased for me when I was born to give to me only after she passed... ALL of my mom's jewelry was stolen... and THAT is what crushed me.\n\nMonday: Much less to explain about the rest of the week but here it is anyway. On Monday while still reeling from the previous day, having not slept much because of just how scared I was. I was informed that a childhood family friend had unexpectedly passed away. He was a husband and father to two little girls. Not much of anything has been released of how he passed yet.\n\nTuesday: I got a call from my Uncle, that one of my cousin's fiancee had died suddenly after complaining of not feeling well, she had told my cousin that she was going to go lie down and when he checked on her a couple of hours later, he found she had passed.\n\nWednesday: My dad messaged the family group chat saying that he was in the hospital. He'd been doing some demo work on a chimney and a portion fell and crushed his hand, trapping him until he broke enough apart to free himself. He drove himself to the hospital (he lives 30 minutes from the nearest one) and by the time he got there his hand had swollen so much that they had to cut off my dad's wedding ring. (As mentioned above his wife passed just this year, they'd been married for nearly 40 years) Thankfully nothing was broken and only needed a few stitches. He laughed off the lack of a wedding band but I know that it's got to be hurting him.\n\nI don't have any quippy conclusion or morals to the story, and I know that there are far worse things happening to people all over the world right now, I'm just extremely overwhelmed so just thanks for listening to me rant I guess. I'm going to meet some potential cats to adopt later today (Thursday) so hopefully it only gets better from here?",

      "selftext": "\n\nAs the title says I just need this off. I dont really have any friends I can vent this to nor family I trust so here goes. Im getting married  very soon. I love my partner. Been together for almost a decade and I still feel as if I cant be away from him. Hes the love of my life. Hes honestly destroyed every bit of self confidence and self worth I've had. Its not on purpose. I know he loves me. I know im not a priority or a need for him as much as he is for me. I know it's bad to have this much codependency on someone but im scared of being alone. Always have been even as a kid. I've struggled with horrible depression in the past and while its been a very long time since its gotten bad, the memories are still ingrained in me no matter how much i just want to forget and move on. The last time being mother's day i think 2022? I wont be to  descriptive to much but it involved prescription pills. Never swallowed just let it sit there till my mouth was numb and just zoned out for a while. I've never spelled it out specifically but I know I've made it aware how it was for me multiple times back then. I just get a text of \"oh im sorry\" followed by \"im going to bed I love you goodnight\". I know I had horrible timing with this happening but I cant control when it happens. It hurt that there was never effort for me and I hate myself for being mad when his childhood best friend would text him saying stuff like im sorry and I love you to him.  my partner assumed  he was ending it and always made a point to rush to his place ASAP. I know this cause every time it occurred we were together. The last time it happened he rushed out on our date. I had to get a ride home from my sister. There's more tbh but i feel like this is to long already.  I won't leave. Ever. I love him. I love his family. They've supported me so much throughout the years any every way possible and theyre a healthy family to around. No one talks shit about each other. There's no walking on eggshells and theres no fear or toxicity at all. Just genuine love and support freely given. Im sorry this is so long and I will delete this soon, maybe in a day or to. If you've made this far then thank you. It genuinely means the world to me. I wish I cant let the past be the past and move on like the 20 something adult that I am. I wish I didn't have to beg for flowers once a month just to never get it unless im crying/begging. I wish I wasn't so insecure with myself that he doesn't find me attractive anymore and he would prefer if I was like the people he watches in porn. I wish I didn't feel stupid  and childish for asking for the same thing all the time because I'm scared to inconvenience him with getting me coffee once a week or surprise with flowers. I wish we could go out to places I enjoy without him looking miserable being there. I wish i was confident again. I wish i wasnt insecure and scared all the time. I wish that i was loved and cherished as much as he is to me. I wish things were different but you cant change the past. We will be married this year and I dont think anything will change, but the least I can do is hope. I love him to much to do so otherwise ",

      "selftext": "I don't really know how to explain this frustration, really. It's not that she did anything wrong. She's not being rude or hurtful or anything, I'm just really really tired. I feel like I'm spread too thin and I don't have much left to give. It's all just too much...\n\nIt all started a few months back - my mom's health took a turn for the worst. She started some treatment which made her immune system go out of whack and unfortunately that caused an infection and she was just gone. It was a matter of weeks. One moment she was her usual self, then she had an MS flare-up and soon she was just gone. It was so sudden. \n\nAnd then before I really had time to deal with my feelings of that, my sister told me she was getting divorced. I don't blame my sister for that - the way her ex behaved regarding my mom's health and passing made it absolutely the right choice, but my sister just started depending on me so much for everything - emotional support, childcare, it was too much. I used to be able to be there for her all the time, but I just can't as much anymore. I have a job. I have my own children to deal with. I can't have a 2 hour phone call with her at 2am then get up and function all day like I could when I was 23. \n\nTo make things worse, her ex is making the divorce an absolute nightmare. He keeps making things up or randomly opposing previously agreed to terms, which my sister needs to deal with, which often involves turning to her lawyer, the social worker managing the case and sometimes a judge. It drains her time a resources, and then I have to shoulder some of that load as well. It gets absurd - at one point he used her spare key to her car to take his daughters car seat. There was no reason to, as far as I can tell, except it being a gift from his mom or something and wanting to be petty. He just left her without one without telling her, which meant I had to be called to give her my spare. It was the pettiest shit in existence.\n\nThey're trying to sell their house, which they have to do to cover what I now know to be an absolutely unreasonable mortgage they took out to buy it, but this having to go through 2 levels of lawyers (the ones handling their divorce & the one handling the property stuff) also makes it both cumbersome and exhausting.\n\nAnd I'm just drained. I want to be there for my sister, and even more importantly - my niece, but I'm just so tired all the time. I feel myself have less patience, become less fun with the kids. I hate that they're paying the price for what isn't their fault at all but I just don't know what to do. I considered therapy but I genuinely don't have the time. My wife's been a godsend, but her work is incredibly demanding and there's only so much she can reasonably do, and besides, these aren't really her monkeys. I can only reasonably burden her with so much. I'm just drained. \n\nI don't know what to do really except soldier on. But it's just really hard right now.",

Came across a freshly hit cat, obviously gone. Must have just happened, the blood pool reflected the light. Almost drove past but realized how heavily trafficked that intersection is early in the morning and I just couldn’t leave him there like that. Threw my hazards on, grabbed a shirt from the back of my car, wrapped him in it, and moved him to the side of the road. Couldn’t stop saying “It’s okay now, baby”.  Tried to fix his head so it wasn’t left bent at an uncomfortable angle. Happened a couple of hours ago but still can’t help but worry that I didn’t do enough. I posted in the local community FB group and am so worried about his owners, and more anxious about if he doesn’t have any what will happen to him. Part of me wants to go back tomorrow morning but I know if I do and he is still there I won’t be able to emotionally handle it. \nSorry rambling and just kind of want this to go into the Internet void",

      "selftext": "I've been really struggling as I was 18 and this girl I liked was 16 which I justified by thinking 2 years isn't that bad and we were on a trip in another state. I am just wondering if I did assault her in fact as I recall thinking \"I gotta touch her waist\" as I was obsessed to the point of fetishization of it and making creepy in hindsight remarks about it calling it snatched for not good reasons. I then recall in a museum I touched it a moment a few seconds and really \"enjoying\" it after but I am unsure as to my motivations whether romantic and guiding her and then that happened as a unfortunate affect of contact or for pleasure or a mix of both. I am aware I was supposed to be better than this as I am supposed to be a mature adult.\n\nI have had serious issues with objectifying women before in my life idk what is wrong with me clinically but my mind often reverted back to them as objects like seeking photos of them for me to get off to I honestly thought I was better until this incident occurred as I ceased all contact with girls in that manner for the most part.\n\nI was really freaked out about it and the possibility of me having done assault so I brought it up with her a few times freaking her out understandably and also mentioning how I found her waist attractive which was why I was questioning my motives as I didn't cease due to the guilt making me obsessed, I am pretty sure I have ocd but I am unsure if I am and was more worried about her well being or how I am perceived.\n\nI talked to my parents about it and they labelled it as a bad boundary breach but not sexual assault but me being a teenager with hormones acting badly for a moment and I shouldn't repeat. I decided to go with this and its been a long few months with other ocd issues but it came about today and made me question everything as a person that was my friend brought it up texting me saying she told him about it and cutting me off over it.\n\nHe said I quote so I recently heard from girls name that on the trip you grabbed her by the waist and started talking about how attractive her waist was. what’s that about? and then I told him and he replied, so first off, that’s harassment, second, that’s a minor, third, that’s girls name and then he proceeded to cut me off.\n\nI consulted ai again and it said I committed sexual assault this time and also sexual harassment. My parents said the same as last time so I'm unsure what is real and not and am terrified and horrified of the label of having done or being a sexual assaulter or harasser, I also have trouble taking accountability due to this so any help would appreciated.\n\n  \n",

      "selftext": "I threw my own birthday party and no one showed up\n\nWhen I was growing up, I was never really celebrated. I was an unplanned baby to two people who hated each other and I was punished for it. Yet the same two people had another child, my sister, who was planned and from day one was treated differently than me. \n\nI used to get small birthdays, just very close family, maybe some new clothes, and a small cake. That stopped when I turned 5. I slowly watched my birthday turn into my sister's second birthday. When I was 7 no one said happy birthday to me at all but I watched my sister get a gift, usually something I asked for. Nothing huge at first, maybe a Barbie doll I wanted or a stuffed cat (I really love cats). This went on for years and I slowly stopped celebrating my birthday myself. \n\nI would try to do something for myself every year though. Go dress shopping or maybe get a new anime figure. This year had a lot of downs for me and I found myself in a rut of sorts. I never go out but I have a decent amount of friends. At least I thought I did. \n\nI decided to do something for myself that I've never gotten to do and that was to through a small house party. I planned it for a month. Texted everyone reminders and I never expected gifts as I just wanted to spend time with friends. I spent so much money on booze and food and other party favors, money I don't really have but I never cared about that honestly. I just wanted to celebrate with people I thought were my friends.\n\nNo one showed. No one texted back and the ones that did had excuses. Suddenly everyone had plans they forgot about but they agreed a month ago and we all took time off together. I feel so hurt and lonely. If anything, it's just made me realize that my birthday isn't meant to be celebrated. I'm not expecting royal treatment or to be given the most expensive gifts ever; I just wanted to feel....something? \n\nDon't get me wrong, I love myself a lot, there's no issue with that. I just want people to love me too or at least show up when we plan stuff. Everyone was so excited yesterday and today? I just don't understand...I go to their birthdays and give gifts, even random \"I thought of you\" gifts, I never get the same. It's not like I expect it, I genuinely love giving which was the point of the party. This is almost embarrassing honestly. \n\nI'm rambling but I'm so hurt. It just brings back all that pain from my childhood and I can't help but connect the two. I'll be okay. I'm always okay. ",

      "selftext": "I (24f) have a younger brother (22m) with autism who I have so much disgust and resentment for.\n\nHe is not disabled to the point where he cannot manage himself physically, and I am grateful for that at least. He is verbal, takes care of his own basic needs, and does well in school. You would only really know he is autistic if you spoke to him. However, he gets irrationally angry to the point of breaking things, yelling, cussing people out, running away, etc. It has caused my parents to walk on eggshells around him, puts pressure on me to say things I don’t mean to appease him. \n\nOne example of this is today my mother begged me to tell my brother that I loved him and forgave him for all of the disgusting attitude and shit he has said to me during his meltdown the day prior, as he was having another meltdown, and I felt absolutely revolted and could not even fathom having any kind of love for him. \n\nI hate him so much that I do not want biological kids in the future since the chances of me having children with autism are probably more likely since it so evidently runs in my family. I don’t know what I will do once my parents pass and I’m left with this burden, but I would absolutely hate to be stuck with him for the rest of my life.\n\nI know I must sound so cruel, and it is ironic because if anyone irl knew it was me writing this they would be genuinely shocked. I am shocked to be writing this myself to be honest, as I did not realize that I held this much hate to the point of having to write it out and posting this but I’m at the end of my sanity with the amount of repressed hatred in my heart and it makes me feel bad for myself and my brother. I look at other older siblings of autistic people I know personally, and wish that I could accept him and love my brother as they do, as my parents wish me too, but I cannot. At best I can coexist, not engaging with him. Though I will bend over backwards to help him, for the sake of my parents. I do not hold anything but resentment for him and almost feel like an only child, though that would probably be an easier life. I cannot help but wonder what it would be like to have a sibling that I could have a relationship with and mourn that possibility. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUPDATE:\n\nI appreciate all of your supportive and kind comments, thank you for all of your insight. After reading your responses and my original post again multiple times, I am realizing a few things. \n\nWhen I wrote this post, I was in a state of intense rage after experiencing such an emotionally charged situation. It was cathartic to use hateful words to convey my thoughts so freely after feeling so especially powerless and resentful. \n\nNow with a clearer mind, I see that it is not my brother that I hate, but rather the lifelong disregard for my feelings by my parents. I resent the expectations and the blame they have placed on me. It is their own incompetency that causes them to live in fear of their own son. I am disgusted by how their cowardice has allowed them to enable him, and I am almost offended on his behalf that they see him for his disability first and foremost, as opposed to an intelligent human being who can learn to manage his emotions and take responsibility for his own actions. \n\nI did not choose to be born, and neither did my brother. My parents chose to bring children into this world and assume the responsibility of caring for them, regardless of the outcome of the genetic lottery. I should not have to bear the burden of parenting my brother or parenting my own parents. \n\nSo I guess the conclusion here is I actually hate my parents, not my brother. Just kidding, kind of.",

      "title": "I am mentally exhausted with life right now.",
      "selftext": "I’d like to start off by saying I don’t want to give away any identifying details as I’d prefer to stay anonymous, but just know I am a disabled F20 who is living with her mother, and animals - while being homeless.\n\nI’m writing here to get this all off of my chest as I do not have a lot of places where I am able to share my thoughts freely about the situation I am in.\n\nMy mother and I were evicted from the house we were living in earlier this year due to poor financial choices that my mother made. I contributed to the household by paying the electric bill with money I received from schooling, and I constantly made sure the phone, water, and rent was paid. Unfortunately, my mother fell through and it led to us having to stay with her…not at all so great father for a short period until my mother’s next paycheck.\n\nWe were even in the car for a short while, it was torture. The sun beamed through the window, we barely had any money for food, and you’d think there would be easy places to park and sleep for the night - but we had to drive miles and miles to find a place where a police officer wouldn’t knock on our window telling us we aren’t allowed to camp out in a Walmart parking lot. It was awful. \n\nEventually with the help of several family members, and my mom’s check finally coming in, we were able to FINALLY find an affordable hotel where we could easily pay for the month and have money leftover for pet expenses, food costs, and anything else we would need that month. While it’s not an ideal situation, I was content and happy. My mental health wasn’t in a bad place for once, and with my disability, I was finally able, after months and months of not being able to, go and see doctors to help me get back on a care plan. Everything was okay and I was happy with that.\n\nUntil recently.\n\nMy mother got a new job, and we were going to move to a new area. This area also was where a school I wanted to attend was. I was ecstatic. At this time, I admittedly was not asking questions about which hotel we would be at, or how much it would cost. I let my mom handle that because I figured, since she was much older than me and she knows more than me, certainly she got this. I don’t want to constantly monitor everything and I just went with the flow. \n\nIt wasn’t until we arrived to the new area, hours later as we had to drive by car, that I came to learn more about the true situation we were in. We were out of money. I don’t know how - we just had it all ready to go? What happened? To be honest, I still truly don’t know exactly what happened. We didn’t have any food for us, and all my mom got me to help calm me down, as moving our things into the room caused me to have an asthma attack, was a Fanta Orange soda. It had Freddy Fazbear on it, which made me a little happy.\n\nThe new hotel we were in was paid up until a week from then, and my job - while my mom went to start her new job - was to look for programs and services that would help us. I did! I didn’t want to do this part, but it also came to me asking family friends and members for any financial support. I’m ashamed about it. Even as I type this, I’m embarrassed and I feel like a loser because I’m in this situation and it’s difficult for me to work. This isn’t anyone else’s problem nor should it be - this is my mother and I’s issue and it’s on us to fix it.\n\nEven so, lots of people came through for us during it. I’m eternally grateful, thankful, appreciative, and apologetic. I don’t know what else to feel other than that. I feel awful. \n\nThe month of September went by, and October was supposed to be the fresh start finally. My mom’s paycheck came in, and everything was supposed to be okay. I finally took the bull by the horns and planned everything out. I spent hours, upon hours, to look through sites, programs, deals, for anything that could help us. I planned out a hotel that all my mother had to do was pay, and we’d be okay. That’s all she had to do. The hotel was affordable, we would’ve had less money for groceries, but to me, while going through barely having any food in the hotel is hell already, I’d rather be inside and on a bed experiencing hunger than in a car in a random parking lot. All she had to do was pay the hotel for the month and we’d be okay.\n\nThat didn’t happen. She didn’t listen to me. Again. I just wanted her to just pay for the hotel, and we’d be okay. I had it all planned out and our budget in order, and all we’d have to do is follow it. I explicitly and begged her to follow this because we didn’t have any other choice. All my begging, and pleading, and work to find us a decent place for all of us - just went down the drain. \n\nShe told me, plainly, “I fucked up.” \n\nThat was a few days ago. Since then we’ve met with housing programs and I’ve been looking for jobs. My disability holds me back, but right now, I can’t think about that. I feel like what I’m thinking about right now is that maybe if I take control of the finances, we’ll be okay. I’ve done it in the past where if I am in control, things get done and the household runs. I’m supposed to start school in December, and my plan was to take this break for myself to get my health in order. \n\nI have headaches everyday, my anxiety is now leading to physical problems like scratching my skin and pulling my hair out, and right now, I can’t remember a day where my body doesn’t hurt anymore. I just wanted to finally not have to worry about housing and just focus on myself for once. That’s what my mom always wanted me to do - alas, she’ll go awry from the plan and it leaves me to pick up the pieces. \n\nIn all, my trust is….less right now. This isn’t the first time this has happened as evident in the beginning of this post. I’m just really mentally exhausted and extremely hopeless right now. Tomorrow, we’re supposed to have to go in the car since this hotel was only paid for a short time - instead of the full time I planned for. I’m frustrated and I’m upset.\n\nI didn’t realize I had written this much. But thank you for reading, if you read this far. I appreciate it :)",

When I found out I had a ovarian cyst, I cried because I knew how painful they are to handle and they can be cancerous even if its a very small chance. I told my mom, she just said \"I have it too you would be fine.\" Then just hangs up the call. I told my dad he just yells at me saying its because I eat unhealthy everyday. I get it im fat I weigh 250 or so pounds and I dont really care about my health, but I do eat healthy when they are gone. I cook myself food when they are gone. I cant say anything about my job because I know im part time and I only work 6 hours per shift (I work at a popular fast food joint that is constantly busy) they said its not a real job, i get paid a little more than minimum wage for fast food and I can get paid more the more skills they teach me. They constantly put me down, I cant express my physical pain when im on my period because they have it worse. I cant express i have no motivation because \"i have everything in life\" I know I have a good house, I know we are good in life. But they seem to think that money is all I care about. Im spoiled for wanting something expensive, im spoiled for walking out in an argument, im this explosive daughter who's always selfish, angry, spoiled, rude, bitchy, everything. They cant seem to care about how I feel I cried to my dad once because I couldn't understand chemistry and I was failing. My mom got mad at me because he yelled at her for me crying. They dont care how many times I have cried to them so many times as I sign for help and they ignore me. I hate them so much. All they care about is their reputation. I hate my mom for constantly telling me her past as her way of excusing everything and making me her therapist at a young age. I hate my bio dad for never being there in my life. I hate my step-dad for being so dismissive and calling me disgusting, and not wanting to really connect with me. I hate them so much. I hate being their blood. I hate living at the house where I constantly am just forced to stay in my room, because if I get out of my room its always \"something with me\". They have never once considered a divorce. I know they dont love eachother. For hell I know they are both cheating on each other. But I cant say shit because im the bad guy. I hate them so much. I hate them with every part of me, but I know I still beg for their attention.",

Today, I decide to skip because I have to take someone in at 3:30 AM. My mother, who has quite the business going on with airport runs, has to take another person in at 4 AM. She gets booked up with two people around the same time slot occasionally, like this one. So I had to take this 3:30 one.\n\nMarching band runs 6-8:30 on Wednesday nights. I live 50 minutes from campus, so I wouldn't be getting home until after half past 9. Then with doing my nightly routine and winding down, I wouldn't be in bed until after 10, and I'd have to be up at 3. I've also been running on very little sleep the past couple of days and I've got some schoolwork to catch up on.\n\nUnderstandably so, attendance is important, so the director doesn't like it when people miss too many rehearsals. I emailed him that I would be missing rehearsal and he just emailed me back \"This is lame\".\n\nI know I made a decision for the best of my safety and well-being, but a part of me does feel bad about it. I'm not trying to be *that* type of person who just comes up with excuses, and the director knows that, too. These are the only two rehearsals I've missed all season and unless I get sick these last few weeks, I won't be missing any more. ",

I remember anytime when we'd go to my grandma's house he would talk to me then when my mom and grandma would sit down to chat he'd tell me there's something in the backyard.  He would pull me into a shed-thing that my grandma had and assault me there. This happened every single time I went over. I remember it hurting but not knowing that what he was doing to me was bad. He told me to not tell anyone obviously and my mom didn't want me hanging around him alone. I always asked her why, despite the stuff he was doing to me, because he was nice to me. \n\nFast forward to now, I look at a lot of extreme content online, I want to be domestically abused, I'm heavily into CNC. My fetishes also reflect on what had happened to me, I like feeling helpless. I hate being like this. I can't even feel turned on by anything if it doesn't involve me being put in a position where I'm helpless or CNC. \nIt fucking sucks so much. \n\nI have mental disorders that prevent me from fully being normal, resulting in me being heavily medicated. I remember telling my therapist I was assaulted and i started crying but I didn't feel bad for myself. I can tell people I got assaulted and feel numb to it, like I don't even care it happened to me. \n\nIf anything, I have fantasies of wanting him to do it again but I feel so disgusting I have any of these fucking thoughts. I feel so disgusting. \nI went to therapy but honestly, it didnt feel like it worked too well for me. I'm writing this because I'm starting to watch way too much extreme content, and be indifferent about it. \nI'm honestly afraid for myself and feel like I'm such a fuck up of a human being. I'm so disgusted and ashamed of myself for being this way. I just wonder how different I would've turned out, would it be hard for me to get of bed? Would it be hard to regulate my emotions? Would I even be looking at extreme content?? Would I be satisfied with vanilla sex?\n\nMy uncle still tries to talk to me but he's an immature prick, I dont respond to his message for a day and he blocks me lol\nHe always does this and has said nothing but horrible things to me about my parents. Saying my dad is a pig, my mom's good for nothing. \n\nI still remember when he told me my dad is santa claus because he's fat. \n\nAnyway thanks for reading. Needed to get this off my chest. I honestly have no one to confide in about this.  ",

For context, I grew up in a very religiously conservative Middle Eastern household as an only child to immigrant parents in Europe with the expectations, to come out exactly like them. \nWell, they thought wrong, in fact, I’m everything they’re not. I’m bisexual, non-religious, open minded, free and a feminist.. practically everything they’re despise. \nGrowing up I was beaten up for not dressing properly, forced to learn about a religion I never believed in, I wasn’t allowed to have friends or a boyfriend/girlfriend, was told they’d disown me if I wasn’t a virgin or even thought of coming out as slightly sexually-different (as in into women). \nAs I child I developed hatred for the place I was born in, my family and myself. I tried to kill myself multiple times with my first attempt being at 10 years old and ending in me landing in a psych ward. I almost succeeded at it due to an overdose on drugs when I was only 14. \nI was hanging out with all of the wrong people - which I unfortunately didn’t know back then - and got into hard drugs and the rave scene. I was partying day and night, taking drugs and thinking I’ve had built up a new ‘’family’’ of people who understood me. Now that I’m older I know that we were all misunderstood and lost tho. \nAt 15, I got into a toxic relationship with a narcissist and I left home to live with him. As if it couldn’t get any better, I was yet again mentally abused and neglected and at 17, I finally broke free. \nI healed myself, moved back home to save up on money, built a slightly better relationship with my parents and got my life together. I started traveling and seeing the world. \nNow at 19, I’m starting to feel like I’ve been holding my real self in for the past 2 years, clinging onto the hope that my parents will change one day. \nMy mom describes me as a monster for being rude to her but she doesn’t see her mistakes. I can’t look at her without seeing all of the abuse she put me through despite being a loving person myself. It’s difficult for me to hate my parents because at some point I know they were raised in such a culture + they’re old. But still, I wish to see them bloom - just not at my garden. \n\nUnfortunately, I’ve had it tough throughout my entire childhood and teenage years to the point where I decided to switch countries and move away to start over. Sorry for the long text, it’s just a little venting for me since I’m super frustrated and lost in life at the moment. \n",

      "selftext": "I don't even really know what to do. This is really hard for me to write now. One day back in 2023 i was playing Skywars on Hypixel (a Minecraft server), where sometimes there used to be a dog spinning around you to catch you if you were cheating or not, and it was using random player's names that have logged in the past 3 days or something like that, well the name i've seen used was one of a girl that has been friends with two of my friends, i also knew her from another Minecraft server before from back in 2018 but we have only exchanged a few words in 2020, by then i've already had a new Discord account so i decided to add the girl on Discord and let her know that i've seen her name being used as the anticheat bot. Later that week i played SkyWars in a night and she wished me good luck and we exchanged a few words in DMs. From there, it just went to be a friendship, until she wanted to troll a mutual friend of ours that we were together, i did accept to act as if we were together but that act didn't really end and it carried over in our DMs lol. This was the start of edating but i was actually happy about it because she was from the same country as i am, i didn't have had experiences with a girl before in a relationship or erelationship, she wasn't such a random to me afterall cause she was mentioned sometimes by those friends of ours (and so i was mentioned to her), and i already knew of other edating stories that actually became a thing and they were happy, i had nothing to lose from chatting so i just decided oh yea it's a good idea. And it went well!.. for like 4 months. Now for some context, I was 16 at that time (i'm now 19, turned 19 this year) and she was 15 at that time (she's 17 now, turns 18 this year), so clearly neither of us was mature enough. It was all going so well, she even wanted to meet me IRL at some point when it was summer but i said that we should wait a little bit (i didn't really feel comfortable meeting so early). She did share some information about her to me, i barely said anything about who i am IRL. She kept wanting me to voicechat with her, i didn't really want to do it that much (we did it like three times) because i was scared that i'm gonna wake up on the internet. Before i mention what happened i just want to say that our language often has colorful words as jokes (so if you say \"fuck you\" in here to a friend, yea, its more of a joke than serious). Anyways, one day we got into an argument and i just insulted her of her mother so she blocked me, i knew it was temporary and she needed space cause that has happened like 3 times but this time i went and reported a few messages of her and that was enough for her Discord account to get terminated. She's had some memories on it, past conversations, all of those were gone. She obviously wasn't happy and thought i was the reason why she got terminated, because it happened so quick (and yes, i did get her terminated). I however said that i had no fault in it, but she believed me at that time (i assume she figured it out later). Well, anyways, we let that in the past and three months go by of happiness until something happens again. This time, she's extremely scared of her Discord account being terminated again so just as a precaution starts deleting her messages from the conversation between us. So i do the same, but in the meanwhile when she takes a break i just call her a cow and tell her a few horrible things again, as if i didn't already do it minutes before she started deleting her messages and she also insults me back (she's done that almost everytime i insulted her, and i insulted her back everytime she insulted me). The weight of the insults were also varying but more often than not mine were way more insane. Me, who i thought of myself as a king, then tried to get her out from some communities, got her banned from the server we were playing on. At one point she's probably had enough because she didn't actually unblock me the next day when she did block me, and she was acting a little bit more cold. But i didn't really care, so she did rageout and tell me to kill myself like a few times in the span of like between a week and at most 2 weeks. Either way, it triggered me and i snapped. Here's where it gets worse. I didn't know what she had against me, why does she act like that, i try to be calm but she isn't. I don't know what the fuck was in my mind, i don't exactly remember, but i think i was like \"if you mess with me, i'll mess with you, but i'm winning\". Remember how i said she shared more stuff about herself to me than i shared stuff about myself to her? At that time i likely felt in a position of power, so i decided that day to.. dox her. When she found out, she was furious, and for a good reason. It wasn't just about senseless insults anymore, it was betrayal. She did NOT deserve to be doxxed, I came to realize that was a too extreme solution for a smaller problem. I mean, i could just block her if i wanted, just ignore her since insults don't really affect me anyways, or try to talk the situation. 2024 came. Since we were both sweats of the same minigame (and we still are sweats of the same minigame in 2025, i do not want to specify the exact minigame), we kept meeting each other in lobbies. She kept hating on me when i was doing nothing so i just hated on her back and this went for some time. I then wrote a few long texts about how \"i miss her\" and just sent them in a few Discord servers in which she was in for the purpose of getting people to bother her and message her for no reason. Even fake apologies. I kept doing that until i got banned myself, and then i almost got her second Discord account terminated as well as the Discord account of a friend of hers. Not sure how they got un-terminated, but i'm happy for that now. Two months later of silence, i write a sincere apology to her from an alt account because i felt depressed. She wished me a merry christmas, didn't even block that account from what i've seen (to this day that alt is not blocked) and that was the last time we actually exchanged two messages without hate being involved. I don't know what got into my mind again because not even a week later i started to use one of her past IGNs, her Minecraft skin and saying wild stuff again and at that point my apology was basically for nothing. I then went and primarily mained some other minigame, until actually three months ago when i got bored of said minigame so i decided to pick another one and this one was one that she also decided to play, and we were meeting each other there again. We didn't say anything to each other, she tried to dodge me at times, at some times i tried to dodge her (dodging being as in going back to the lobby to avoid a player). Good to say, she was in the community for that minigame and so was i. Once you say a lie too much, you believe it is the truth. Since i kept lying with those depression texts, it eventually became what i believed. A month ago there was a discussion in the Discord server about depression, in which i wrote yet another paragraph about how i've been a victim and how i've been harassed for 4 months since that's what i believed, though i never mentioned her name in there but i did tell it to one of the people i was talking to in DMs. The guy for some reason just went and asked her about it, and she got in there with two of her friends; one of them said that i didn't say the full story while the other was just insulting (i did quite ignore him or sent him copypastas as replies, made him think i cared about insults). But then i got into a friendly argument with someone else in a different community about morality and i've understood a few things. Later that day, since i collect screenshots, i just looked at old screenshots from the 2023-2024 period of time and realized: wait, i did fuck up. I then started to connect the dots that i couldn't connect back in 2023 and back in 2024; why did she hate me that much? Maybe because i wasn't so fun to deal with. She kept telling people that she had some screenshots about what i did to her, but when time came for her friends to actually reveal what i've done, they've asked her for screenshots and they waited days and days and she never really sent them any screenshots, except one of the texts of depression. I highly doubt she doesn't have not even one screenshot of when i was basically insulting her whole bloodline, including phrases like \"hope you get thunderstruck\", so i think she just chose not to share them. She also hasn't really talked about what i did to her, at least not publicly and not to too many people because so far i found out only two people that knew her side of the story. After the argument, after connecting the dots, after realizing that i did fuck up.. i almost wanted to cry. All this time i started to believe i was the victim, when in reality i was being harsh and treated her like garbage. I actually feel extremely bad and extremely sorry now, but i think it's too late for me to do anything, especially since i fakely apologized like maybe 4 times before. If i did try to apologize, she wouldn't believe me, and only words are not enough to repair my mistakes. I realize i've been an idiot and i still am. If i had a time machine to go to my old self and just tell myself to not do those things, the time machine would be too busy teleporting me from day to day to hour to hour. I want to make it right in someway, i have had troubles sleeping the past two weeks just thinking about what i have truly done. I am aware that there's a 99.99% chance she will not forgive me and i do not expect her to be friends with me again since that will likely never happen, but i do want to make her feel happy in someway, because i did notice that she still hates me a lot and has been talking bad about myself even a few months ago when i did nothing. I keep asking myself, given a fucked up situation like this, how does one try to make things between them and the other person right? How should i try to repair my mistakes towards her? I know i've messed up. I feel so bad for it, and just trying to make myself feel happy doesn't seem to work. I can't stop thinking realizing just how horrible of a person i was...",

      "selftext": "Before I give my update I want to address some things from my previous post:\n\n* I mentioned in my previous post that I couldn't stay in my marriage. I don't know why I got comments saying I need to leave him or asking me why I'm staying after what he did. Or messages calling me a doormat and other names that I won't say here. **I am not staying. I am going to get a divorce.**\n\n* I never said anywhere that my husband didn't cheat on me. **He** said that he didn't meet anyone in person or cheat on me. I don't believe him, and regardless of if he met anyone or not I consider being on dating apps to be cheating. I'm not sure why I got comments saying I'm an idiot or acting like a fool or am wrong. Or messages saying the same thing. **I never stated anywhere that he didn't cheat.**\n\n* I used the term 'revenge porn' because it was the term used by both the police and the solicitor my husband consulted. English is not my first language and when speaking to both the police and the solicitor, and on all the paperwork, it was called revenge porn. So it was my belief this was the English term. With English not being my mother language and it being a time of stress I may have used the wrong words in my post (such as revenge porn and down payment).\n\n* I'm not AI or someone making up a story. This is happening to me. I got a comment and some messages calling me AI or a bot. I posted a reply to the comment to prove I am not a bot, I'm a person.\n\nI have turned off the option to receive messages to avoid more bad ones.\n\n**This is my update:**\n\nI have left my husband, just as I said I was going to do. I moved out of our flat on Saturday and I have a solicitor hired. I have begun the process to get a divorce from my husband. I will not be changing my mind.\n\nMy husband is upset and he begged me not to leave him. He keeps saying he is a victim and I am leaving him in the worst time of my life. He is having trouble in his career because the intimate photos and messages were sent to everyone on his linkedin. He might be a victim of the person he met on the dating app but I am not leaving him because he is a victim. I am leaving him because he was on a dating app messaging others and exchanging intimate photos and because he took £5500 from our savings and left us with nothing. I consider both of those things reasons to get a divorce.\n\nDivorce in the UK is only no fault. So anything my husband did is not considered in the divorce. My solicitor told me she will try to see if I can recover some of the money that my husband took. But otherwise, his being on a dating app or anything else from his behaviour is not relevant to the divorce. My solicitor says I will most likely not have to pay spousal maintenance because I have only been married for two years. She will try to get back the money he took.\n\n I have told my husband there's no reason for us to speak or see each other again. I moved out and want a divorce. There is nothing else to say and I blocked him. I will not change mind about this.\n\nMy thanks to all of you who were nice to me and didn't call me names or send messages. I do appreciate it. This was my update.",

      "selftext": "I (18NB) have struggled with mental health issues my whole life, but only in this past year has the facade of my childhood not being too awful fallen away to reveal the horrors I went through this whole time without even knowing. At the beginning of this year I finally overcame my treatment resistant depression, it was a long battle but I finally found the root cause and was able to begin changing my life for the better. I moved in with my Mom (Who I now sadly know is abusive and manipulated me, but I trusted her at the time) to escape my abusive grandparents, and for a while I felt safe, and that safety led me to begin piecing together what had just happened to me for the past 4 years with my mental health, I realized something was very wrong with my childhood as I had C-PTSD, and I couldn't remember anything from it completely, it was all fuzzy and fragmented. But due to me feeling safe, I began to remember what happened, I remembered my dad emotionally abusing me viciously whenever I was to his house, I remembered all the horrible things he told me about how I'm useless, less than human, a piece of trash, ugly, etc., I realized the reason I hated myself so much was because of him, I internalized what he told me despite me trying to tell myself he was abusive and he was lying. I processed these horrible memories and thought I had overcome my trauma.\n\nBut something was wrong, I still couldn't remember years of my life, my C-PTSD was still very active and I was still constantly dissociating due to something I couldn't figure out. A very important piece of info I should mention is that for years I have been tormented by intrusive thoughts about CSA and other taboo, and I always felt gross after engaging in any kind of sexual activity, but I always thought it was my fault and I was just weird, I never knew the actual cause until very recently. Which leads me to the past couple weeks, when I figured out I had DID and began speaking to my alters, and when one of my alters, one that was created during a memory gap, seemed horrified of sex to the point they begged me to never look at anything relating to it. I became very concerned what was contained in those memory gaps, and when I looked at the symptoms of repressed childhood CSA, it was practically an exact description of everything I'd been going through all this time. And then a couple minutes later, it happened, my brain accidentally showed me the beginning of a CSA trauma due to being confused (I was sick) and instantly my body went into shock, my heart skipped a beat, it felt like the air got sucked out of my lungs, I wanted to vomit. I went into denial and tried to find any other explanation, and called myself an attention seeker, even though that made no sense as my body was in shock from seeing that memory and I didn't want it to be true. After I calmed down, I realized the horrible fact that my dad sexually assaulted me for my entire childhood, I couldn't handle what he was doing to me so my body desperately tried to remove any evidence of it happening from my memory, and it was successful until now. And now that I know it happened, things made more sense, but it was extremely painful to know, as I am now getting somatic flashbacks where I vividly and agonizingly feel everything he did to me during the CSA, and it's so overwhelming that I wanted to just get it out there, and get some small amount of peace about it.",

I hate her so much.\n\nshe left me when i was six to fuck around in thailand, only to return every summer to force me to live with her in a one room apartment with her and my older creep of a brother. We never had money and I had to go hungry most of the time because she couldn't keep a damn job. Only to fly back to Thailand when I had gotten comfortable, forced me to fly down to her with random strangers for her to “See me again”. \n\n\n\nWhilst i was there she had the audacity to force me to go to bars with her on school nights and force me to sleep on the benches in the club and when i wake up and beg her to let me go home she yells at me. She forced me to sleep naked in the same bed as her and forced me to shower with her. I so feel fucking disgusting writing this.\n\n\n\nShe was a fucking theacher in thailand, i was going to this school and you wanna fucking know what. I was bullied there and she did fucking nothing. NOTHING. I’m so fucking tired. \n\n\n\nI got A UTI and she still forced me to go to school, mind you I could not sit up let alone stand, I lied behind some book shelves in a fetal position and just cried and she yelled at me for getting tears on my school work. This UTI lasted a week. Now I have been told they should not last that long. (This info might be wrong if so please correct me) We never went to get a checkup to see if it was more serious.  \n\n\n\nI was between the ages of 6 and 12. AND THATS NOT THE FUCKING END OF IT.\n\n\n\nWhen she moved back to our country, we moved to a smaller apartment. i slept in the fucking kitchen. I had no space and no fucking privacy. She got the living room. \n\n\n\nShe kept fucking drinking, I somtimes stayed with friends, but that stoped when i no longer wanted to bother them with my problems. \n\n\n\nOne night she came home drunk and she was searching for me, yelling my name etcetera. mind you I sleep like three meters from the door (9.8 feet) when she gets to me she lays ON TOP of me and whispers that she loves and cares for me. I somehow managed to push her off me and I ran to my sister (We lived in a weird type of apartment complex where there was no corridor connecting our apartment and my sisters.) and she called me dramatically. I stay there for about 2 minutes before her abusive bf (Now ex) comes to collect me and force me back in to my “bedroom”. just told me to go back to sleep. \n\n\n\nShe started dating an abusive guy, god he was terrible. But that's not the worst guy she has dated let alone MARRIED.\n\n\n\nTwo years ago, she married a man she only knew for three months, he shortly after moved in and he was kinda creepy, his hugs lingered too long how he talked, things like that. the on day i get home from school she sits me down and tells me that there is something she need to tell me, as you know the worst things goes through my head, he died, he's in the hospital things like that but NOTHING she could have said could have prepared me for what she was about to say. This man she has married, THIS FUCKING MAN, is a rapist. \n\nThen there are a bunch of other things like smaller things. \n\n\n\nI’m so sorry if this is all over the place but i just needed to rant I feel fucking disgusting and I hate her so much. But I can’t cut her out cause I will feel bad. \n\n",

When I went out I heard a woman wailing that her son was dead.\n\nMy neighbor asked if I knew CPR. I had got my certificate back in February for my job. I was hesitant when I heard it was her son. I am terrified of doing chest compressions on a child, or not being able to save them.\n\nTurns out it was a 30ish year old man. He was face down with his knees folded into his chest. I flipped him over and heard a gurgle. His ears were blue and his lips were turning blue. I checked his mouth for obstruction… his tongue was fucking green. It looked like he never brushed his teeth. It was revolting to be that close.\n\nIt felt like time stopped while I was considering if I was willing to try to give breathes. I just kind of said “fuck it” and began breathes along with compressions. I tried using my hand as a mouth guard as much as possible.\n\nFor about 12 minutes I did cpr by myself. He took maybe 6 breaths on his own during that time. He was definitely reflexive breathing.\n\nEventually, a police officer relieved me and I stumbled out to my front lawn and nearly puked. Fire department and EMS arrived and gave Narcan. He was able to crawl out of his house on his own.\n\nThe mother was very appreciative toward me, but she was furious when the Narcan saved him. All this was from fentanyl use. I was pissed too. I’m traumatized when I look back and think about his disgusting green tongue. In hindsight, I wouldn’t give breathes again. If we tried Narcan and it didn’t work, because it’s not fentanyl use, I might consider mouth-to-mouth. I feel kind of guilty about it, but I also need to preserve myself.",

      "title": "I’m on the verge of being a homeless college student.",
      "selftext": "I (18F) feel like my world is collapsing. \n\nAll my life my mom has pressured me to excel in school. It has been the only thing I’ve hung on to since I was 13. By 8th grade I had planned out all my high school classes and my plans for college.   I was part of student council, honor society, and class office. I graduated top 10 of my class on high honors the whole time. I was able to follow that plan closely, graduating a year early and starting my associates at a community college with the plan to transfer to a university afterwards. \n\nMy issue is my mom is never home. She takes vacations and trips often and I would be left home alone. I grew up learning how to do everything myself. I learned how to cook, clean, etc all on my own from a young age but I wasn’t great at it due to being self taught. I was still messy as a kid and had a phase where I had a bad attitude. She would threaten to kick me out of the house or send me to boot camp often because of that. \n\nFast forward to the present, she is still threatening to kick me out and those threats hold more weight now that I’m 18. Two weeks ago we got into a fight after she came home from a week long trip. There was a small event happening by my work and I bought some crochet plushies for her boyfriend’s grandchildren as gifts. She had previously complained I never get to visit them as I work or have classes. When I showed her and her boyfriend what I bought she complained that I was wasting money. I got upset by that comment and pointed out how she was the one that complained I don’t get to see them often so I thought I could at least get them a gift to show I do care. I said this rudely and the argument erupted into how I speak to her like I’m her mother and that I am ungrateful. She complained that my room was messy and I was disgusting. It ended up leading to her threatening to kick me out. \n\nThis time was more serious. We didn’t speak for days and we would avoid each other. I often heard her talking about how ungrateful I am and kicking me out to her boyfriend or just muttering to herself in vietnamese when she was alone (which she knows I understand). With school and work this whole situation stressed me out. Between class and during free time at work I would be looking for a place to live and questioning how I would be able to continue going to school. I live in an expensive state and it would be impossible for me to find a place that would allow me to continue with classes. I thought of living out of my car and buying a gym membership to shower if it meant I could continue school at one point. Without school I feel like I am nothing. I have nothing without my academic achievements and that has been drilled into me. 4 days after the initial argument she apologized and we made up. She then left on another week long trip.\n\nLast week during that trip, my cat had gotten ill. I spent the night with him at an emergency vet getting him treated. I was cleared to take him home and had to monitor him and give him medicine. I set up a room and stayed with him for 3 days. I barely slept or took care of myself in  any other way during those days. I was calling my mom and keeping her updated. I wasn’t able to keep myself composed and cried often. She told me if I continued to cry she would get rid of the other cats we had because everything dies eventually. Sadly I had to make the difficult decision to put him down after taking him for a checkup and seeing his condition wasn’t improving and likely wasn’t going to. This is my first time losing a pet. I was devastated. When I was alone at home, which was often, all I had was my cats. He was there for me when I cried at night and was one of few things that brought me joy. I was unable to leave my bed for 3 days after he passed. I’m constantly stuck asking myself if I did enough or if I could have done something to prevent this. \n\nMy mom returned from her trip this week. She complained and got upset my room was still messy and threatened to kick me out again. She leaves for another trip this Sunday. \n\nI feel like I am in a constant loop of my mom threatening to kick me out, being okay, then being threatened again. I’m sorry I didn’t clean my room. I haven’t left my room to even eat so I didn’t really have to motivation to clean it. Even though I was going through all of this while she was in the Bahamas I still managed to clean the kitchen, the floors, most my laundry, and school work. I feel like no matter how much I do it isn’t enough. Getting good grades doesn’t matter because she’s upset my college classes don’t keep me in school for 8 hours a day like high school. She thinks I just dropped out when winter break happens because it lasts too long. If she doesn’t see me doing school work it means that I’m not doing it at all but she’s never home for me to show her anyways. If I forget to do one chore I am disgusting and gross. If I don’t do my chores at the specific time she asks me too I am lazy. If I don’t drop everything to do as she says when she says it causes a fight. I grieve the loss of my pet, she’ll get rid of the others. I play video games to escape, she turns off the wifi. I do school work on my computer, she turns off the wifi. No matter what I do, it’s not enough. She dangles that fact she takes care of me financially in my face every moment she can. I appreciate that and I am grateful to live a comfortable life style but I rather she love me. I practically live alone. Out of the last 5 weeks she’s been home for maybe 2. I hear her talk bad about me more than she talks to me. I counted her messages from now since the beginning of the year and she tells me she loves me maybe 3 times a month. She says it less in person. She never asks how school is, if I’m okay, or anything like that. I’m losing the motivation to continue school if have to worry about if I have a place to live. I’m considering giving up on my dream university that I was accepted into because the only person I can rely on if I get kicked out is my boyfriend who lives hundreds of miles away. I can’t afford dorms or living near by the campus. I would just have to pack up and start over somewhere else. All my plans and goals for the future feel like they are slipping from my fingers. \n\n\n",

      "selftext": "So, it's been years and it's gotten way better, but this small event had such a large effect on my life.  Thought about telling this story before, finally decided to now.  I'm aware this probably isn't that big of a deal, but to me it is.\n\nI (26M) had moved into my mom's house after she divorced my dad.  At the time, my dad was horribly against cats of any kind, while I quite liked them. Despite the fact that these were outdoor cats, I felt the need to bring them with me into our small home to keep them safe from my dad.  It took some time, but they eventually adjusted.  At the time I had 2 cats: Zoey and Blade.  This story is about Blade.\n\nBlade was a fluffball without an evil bone in his body.  Originally my brother's cat, he lived with me due to my brother becoming a dog person.  I became very attatched to Blade, as he was the type of cat you could manipulate and cuddle without a single fear of him getting annoyed.  I would fall asleep with him on the bed, and would wake with him usually lying on the floor by my bed (I had to make sure I didn't step on him many times).  He was a gift.\n\nWhen it happened, he and Zoey were only about 4 years old (I was around 20)  He was in perfect health as far as I knew.  I had noticed him being a bit more clingy the past few days, but didn't think anything of it. Then one morning i slept in a bit.  I remember specifically waking with a start, glancing around the room, and relaxing.  Zoey and blade were both sleeping on some discarded clothes.  I didn't want to wake them, so I stayed in bed a bit longer, scrolling on my phone before finally getting up.\n\nWhen I finally got out of bed a few minutes after I woke, Zoey stood up and stretched, but Blade didn't.  I thought it was odd, normally he'd wake up and run past my legs to greet me.  I walked over and reached out to pet him.  When I felt how limp he was, I knew something was wrong. \n\nThat morning was filled with panic, tears, and a rapid trip to the local vet clinic.  I wrapped him in a towel and rushed him over, and when I arrived he'd already cooled down greatly.  The vet had nothing she could do.\n\nI was told he'd passed away moments before I woke up.  There was nothing I could do, sometimes perfectly healthy animals just pass like this.  There was nothing wrong, he just had a sudden heart attack or something that killed him instantly.\n\nObviously I was distraught.  I still am.  Even though he passed 6 years ago, I still miss the fuzzy dude.  No other cat since then has had the same personality, never been quite right.\n\nThe worst part though.... His passing gave me what I think could be considered PTSD.  Anytime I saw another living creature lying perfectly still, my heart rate would skyrocket and I would immediatly have to check to make sure they were still alive.  Many of my families pets (dogs, cats, etc) have been jolted awake by my shouting their name.  It even got so far that I'd have the same reaction to family members.  My mom slept in one day, and woke up to me shaking her awake in a mild panic.\n\nI learned how to manage it.  Now if I see an animal (or a person) asleep, I'll pause and watch closely to see if they're breathing.  There's been a few times where it was hard to tell and I'd get a shot of adrenaline as I internally panic, but usually a poke will wake them up and calm me down.  \n\nLooking back, I find it a bit outrageous that a cat passing gave me such a volatile reaction to naps, but it's nothing I could control.  I don't know if this is a common thing for pet owners or people who had loved ones pass away in the same manner.\n\nSorry since the story isn't anything as wild as other posts here.  Also, here's Blade for those wondering;\nhttps://imgur.com/a/o1ONKvU\n\nEdit: reposting because I didn't know about the rules here, first time posting in this subreddit.  Apologies.",

So we start playing the stare game and anytime I hide my face she will inch closer.  It is the most adorable thing in the world.  Then she  just sits next to me in the most adorable pose with her tail wrapped around her legs purring without even being petted.  It really triggered something within me about life.  Im not trying to brag, but my cat is like a supermodel.  I spent about 5 minutes staring at her in amazement.  This is my first pet, so I probably sound over excited with emotion, but she is the best thing  that has happened to me in a very long while.  The fact we are lucky to inhale and exhale oxygen to have a consciousness along with a middle muscle by design to keep us alive had to come from something.  As I look at my little criminal sitting next to me, I had an epiphany of how amazing animals no matter how small they are have some pretty legit consciousness too.  My best friend is my cat.

Let me start this of by saying, my son is the best thing to ever happen to me, I love him beyond words. \nBut that's why I'm giving him up. \nI've only been a mother for a year and I already failed. My house is always messy, I'm anxious like 23/6 (I have some amazing days) and I am so so overwhelmed. I don't work. My son is very needy, which I know is normal for a baby. But I can't do this anymore. He's always wanting to touch me, play with me which I know just means he loves me and is bonded to me, I'm very much bonded to him as well. I try my best to spend at least 3 or 4 hours a day playing with him one on one, but it's never enough for him. \n\n\nHe will play alone for maybe 20 mins, then he screams for me to play with him, pick him up and everything else. My house is a mess. I'm anxious and i am constantly worried about my parenting not being enough for him. Because my house is a mess I'm always worried social services (cps) will come and take him. If he gets even the slightest mark I have a meltdown thinking people will think I am abusing him. \n\nI love him so so much, but I can't give him the life he deserves, I am a single mum with very little money, and a exhausted heart. Which is why I've come to the conclusion that I should give him up. I know he will be loved, its impossible not to love him. He has the sweetest laugh, the most loving personality, when I'm upset he brings me his comfort items and snuggles me. \n\nBut I'm a terrible mother, and everyone was right, I'm not cut out for this. Sometimes even playing with him feels like a chore, but then there's moments where we are playing, or he's breastfeeding and looks up at me, or even just stands there laughing like the maniac he is and I think for a second that I can do it. Ultimately he deserves someone better. Someone who can give him all the snuggles, toys, snacks and days out in the world. I know he will miss me for a bit, but he's still little. He will forget about me and love his new family more then he could love me, and that's purely because they'll be able to give him more. But I give up. I'm done. There's nothing left for me. I will miss him terribly and I'm worried what will happen to me once I do give him up, but that's less of a concern then my sons emotional well-being.  \n\nHe's currently sleeping cuddled up to me, and I'm soaking in the last few days before I make the call. \n\nThat's all.

Also if Oz Vault, The Click, and/or EmKay are reading this, hi. :)\n\nAlso, I know it's sounds terrifying, but I need to get something very important out of the way:\n\n***I WILL NEVER BECOME A CANNIBAL! I WILL NEVER CONSUME HUMAN FLESH!***\n\nNow, to the actual problem. Okay, so, my body communicates what it needs through cannibalistic cravings. It's weird, but I know what parts of the human body connect to what need. If I'm only craving human flesh, I'm just anemic and need to eat something rich in iron. If I'm craving a human heart, that's how my body communicates loneliness. However, earlier today, I found myself with an overwhelming urge to eat human brains. I looked it up and I get stuff like how the brain works with cravings, prion disease, and cannibalistic media. Now, there are two routes I can see this: physiological and emotional.\n\nPhysiological--I'm craving something the brain is rich in, like how human blood is rich in iron.\n\nEmotional--That's how my body communicates it's bored and needs something intellectually stimulating, like with my heart and loneliness.\n\nHelp me, please!\n\n\n\nETA: After eating some pizza yesterday, it died down. Evidence: might be physiological and means I need fat.",

I have nothing that makes me happy, I hate myself, I hate my life, bad relationship with my family, almost no friends, no motivation for anything. I go to class just to ask myself why am I there, I really feel like I’m wasting my time. When I get back home I just play video games or watch tv until next day, I used to go to the gym and have a good diet but I lost interest since nothing brought me joy. I used to have the motivation of being the person I wanted to be but it looks like I will never get to be that person. Maybe that’s the saddest thing about my life; hating myself and knowing I can’t change myself. I ask God why I have to suffer this much, I ask Him why I have to feel like this, I ask Him why he gave me eyes that hate my face. The only and best friend I have is really good looking, this makes me so sad because he really is my best friend but I feel so bad to be as ugly as I am, I hate every single thing in my face and wish one day I wake up with the face I forever wanted, I really just want to disappear, I really just want to have something that brings me a little happiness.",

The track I released last year, didn’t get much streams though. But amongst the friends I’ve shared them with, few of them already have my artist profile as top 5 artists they listen to on Spotify. One of them did not openly ever mention, until I caught him off guard while he was scrolling though a track he wanted show me through his Spotify app, and when I confronted him about it he did admit that he listens to it quite a few times on a regular basis. It made me happy. I had no idea my music had such an impact, even if it was one or two people. Recently another friend of mine stumbled upon my track, two days back he texts me saying “what in the groovy world did you hook me into?! I’ve been playing your track on repeat, you are on my top 3 artists I listen to!” This gives me immense motivation to move forward and completely eliminated the voice in my head that constantly questioned, whether I am worth it or not. Yes my art is yet to reach its right audience. Getting a reach on streaming services and social media has been a nightmare, I know I need to keep going at it, I’m working on more tracks, but in this era of internet, I’m not sure really how I can spread my message to ones who really need it. My music is a message, and in this life I really am nothing without it. My life is filled with pain, part of that pain is what forces me to project on my artistic vision of what i produce. That doesn’t mean my pain is stronger or worse than yours, but all I wish is that the blood soaked message I offer with my music, helps you to ease your own pain. I don’t enjoy my 9-5 anymore. My personal life is no where near decent. All my life I’ve been told I’m never enough. This pain only kept growing as I grew older. Until I found music. I don’t really have anyone to call home, just a mirage of a family that was broken a long time back, whose broken shards sting me hard, and harder each time I try to pick them or put them back together. I would have killed myself long back if it wasn’t for music, it’s like the only home I know now. So the only thing i wish out of this life is to be eventually heard… for I am nothing without it.  ",

      "selftext": "It is just me (28M) and my children. I'm a solo father and it already sucked before, little support, people judging single parents, and worst of all the assumtions that i'm just babysitting for the day or \"awe its dads day, out I bet mums happy to have some rest\"  which an old lady said to me. When the reality is, it has been 3 and half years of full custody with no more contact with the other parent.\n\nI love my kids, but as messed up as it sounds, if it wasnt for my want to not let them grow up in a rough enviroment like I did, my want to make sure they are provided for, cared for and to feel loved unconditionally, I would drive to the shops or mechanics to get a part for my car as I like fixing it up (being a really cheap car and the only real irl hobby I have), then speed on the way back, put music on a little louder and crash into a tree or something, I mean theres roads near me that are straight, usually quiet and in the middle of no where, ending at a juction I could easily not stop for. My life insurance would cover that. That has just been playing round and round in my mind.\n\nI'm not going to, I've had these thoughts since I was 10/11 when my mum went into prison and I was left with my dad, so I guess i've just made a family tradition with my own situation. I have always engaged in mental health services, my kids will always be unaware of that part and I keep it hidden during the day when theyre awake. On my down time I have a therapist who I will discuss this recent news with however I just need to get it off my chest now.\n\nI am just typing as I go, sorry its long, but anyway, I lost my job. I was studying part time as well which I definetly can't do anymore and I lost my job recently, I was applying for my countries benefit system today which is what has tipped the iceburg, and I just have no idea what I am going to do.\n\nMy workplace closed and I worked during school hours at setting and then did paperwork/ computer work before I went to bed. It worked, I was lucky, now I am going to have to figure out what the hell to do, even my countries supposed support system, expects me to work 30 hours a week immediatly. Now thats fine, I was doing 25 in person and about 15-20 at home. I have worked since I was 15 I am now 30, I have contributed but when I need a little help I get told no. Sure i'll get a top up extra from the Government but no where near what I was earning, and just having to still find something immediatly or risk loosing all benifits just suck, I might as well not applied.\n\nNow the 25 doesnt seem much worse than 30. Expect the problam is my children are only in for 30 hours a week, thats standard here, so unless I can teleport I will need to pay for after school care since I have no family. I checked today and that'd cost me an extra 700 a month.\n\nSo I earn less but have to pay more. I know you can't live off the Government forever but it just annoys me theres no safety net to fully support people like me short term.\n\nThank you for reading.\n",

However, when he was set to return to visit Korea from the USA a couple of weeks later, he said that he didn’t like hickies and didn’t want one because his daughters would see. \n\nHe always refused photos and demanded that I delete them when I took any and got upset when I tried. I once pointed out that my Ring doorbell camera always captured him, and he said - unprompted, not like I had threatened- that it was illegal to post the footage. \n\nWhen I once accused him of seeing other women, he said, “I only have you in the USA and my wife -EX-wife! - in Korea.”\n\nDespite all these red flags, I fell for him. Our relationship ended at the end of May, when he returned to Korea at the end of his job contract. He got in touch with me after a time, saying that he missed me. But once I challenged him about possibly being married, he began pulling away. \n\nI kept reaching out, to my shame, because I kept thinking the narrative would eventually make sense. That he would finally be clear with me. But the only thing that became clear is that he wanted me out of his life for good. \n\nKorea isn’t like the USA. There’s no real way for me to get any answers due to privacy laws. Therapy hasn’t helped me process that I let a stranger into my home. It’s going to have to be time. ",

Just like I told you I would. I respect consent and value it, do you?\n\nBut you? You are STILL baiting me. You keep lurching around in my digital periphery, leaving emotional breadcrumbs like I’m supposed to chase you. Why the ever living fuck would I do that NOW?! According to you: “It wasn’t reciprocal”, remember?\n\nNo. I won’t break no contact for you. No, I won’t cede you the narrative control you’re so desperate to reclaim. You don’t get to rewrite the story after the damage is done. Own it or fuck off.\n\nYes, you are the villain in my story. Yes, I see through your avoidance and control.\n\nYou misread me. Repeatedly. You thought that because I was selectively vulnerable, I must be anxiously attached. You were wrong. I’m a fearful avoidant in recovery~ and that selective vulnerability? It was me testing whether you could be trusted. I gave you just enough vulnerability to see what you’d do with it. And sure enough, the moment it suited you, you used it against me… just like every single manipulator before you.\n\nYou didn’t disappoint. You confirmed exactly what my nervous system had been screaming the whole time: “This isn’t safe. This is performance. This is manipulation wrapped in false gentleness.”\n\nEvery question I asked you? Every hard conversation I initiated? That was me fighting through my terror. Not because I needed you (I absolutely did not) but because I wanted so desperately to believe you were different.\n\nMy default is to do EVERYTHING on my own because it has been proven throughout my entire life that people will use it against you. The only times I reach are when I am close to making an irreversible decision and ONLY then. That’s why I reached for you, and you seem to have taken that as dependence. I WANTED to connect with you, I didn’t need to.\n\nMy ex, also a recovering avoidant, read every message you sent me. At first, he defended you when I would talk with him during moments of confusion. He said it looked like you were treating me like a relationship. But eventually, even he saw it: you were mirroring all his old behaviors, just with more polish and plausible deniability. And unlike you, he apologized. He named the harm. He admitted what he did. He stayed, even when it was hard. You? You vanished behind polite cruelty and sterile language.\n\nYou assumed that because I had feelings, I would tolerate your passive aggression, your silence, your condescension. You thought I’d come running. But here’s the thing about fearful avoidants: When we finally decide someone is unsafe, we rip the cord out at the root and cauterize the rest. Thank you for reminding me why I became avoidant in the first place.\n\nYou could have fixed this. You could have acknowledged the pain. But instead, you gaslit me, discarded me, and tried to position yourself as the “reasonable one”. HAH. All while you were the one with power. You were the one who watched harm fall on me again and again…and did nothing. You let me bleed out so you could keep your hands clean.\n\nYou sold me out to keep the peace with people who hurt me. You abused your role. You abused me.\n\nAnd what’s worse? You still lurk. Still watching. Still baiting with nostalgia and emotions I used to fall for. Still avoiding the one thing that might’ve saved you even a shred of dignity:\n\nAccountability.\n\nYou were never a mistake because I loved you.

He was with my mother in law the whole day since she stayed home from work (we live with my husbands parents). He didn’t bother wanting me to hug him or hold him like usual, he pushed off of me to try to do his own thing on the ground since he crawls now. When he sees my MIL, he gets happy and raises his hands to be with her. I work from home so it helps that she can care for him while I work but he tends to stay with her till it’s time for her to go to bed. I know I can just say no and tell her I want to spend time with him but the time spent with him is me trying to play with him or show him how to use his toys and I feel like that bores him. But he seems to only pay attention to me when he wants to breastfeed. I’m probably overthinking it and exaggerating in my head but it just feels like he prefers my MIL over me. Every morning he would smile at me and do sort of a cuddle but the past few days he doesn’t give me the same morning smile and sounds annoyed at me trying to kiss his cheek or hug him. Anyway, just wanted to rant because I feel like my baby wouldn’t miss me if I were to suddenly disappear. I’m just being emotional.",

But their tattoo artist is shit. They use so much heavy black that my friends’ tattoo looks like a black mess on their upper arm.\n\nYou can’t tell what it is from far away. And holy hell, it’s hard to even tell what it is up close. If they didn’t tell me what it was I would have had no idea what to look for.\n\nI feel like a major asshole. I can’t even be happy for them because they just keep going back every few days and getting more stuff tattooed onto their body. Their artist doesn’t leave any skin unshaded. It looks like a poorly done coverup.\n\nI told them to wait a little longer in between getting the tats to let them heal, to maybe think a bit longer before getting more. They said “no, it’s fine.” They just want more and more tatts with no thought behind them.\n\nThen their artist doesn’t even show them what the finished product would look like BEFORE they get the tattoo. They only show the stencil. Maybe that’s just what the artist does, idk. I’m also not mad at the artist if they are a beginner tattoo artist. That’s fine and awesome the artist is following their aspirations. But the amount of solid black ink they use is horrible. I am really concerned that my friends’ tattoo is going to bleed and heal into this even bigger black mess on their arm.\n\nI can’t even look at them now without noticing that big black mass on their arm first. I still enjoy their company, this will never push me away from being their friend. I love them to the ends of the earth. It’s just hard now to see that they’ve, in my opinion, ruined their skin in less than two weeks.\n\nI did not say any of this to their face. I wouldn’t be a jerk to someone’s face. I am happy they’re getting tattoos, no doubt because it is a luxury item to have tatts. Maybe I’m more mad at their artist than anything. Also we are only in our early 20s, there are plenty more artists to go to and they refuse to believe there’s someone better.",

The last couple of times we gave actually had sex he hasn't been able to finish either and so I just feel like he isn't attracted to me even though he says he is. I don't know what to do and maybe I shouldn't complain at all but I just feel so lonely and I don't know how to make it so we're both happy. I think he might be asexual, but that's hard for me to accept because his body count is higher than mine. I'm at the point now where I almost wonder if this relationship is good for both of us even though in every other department we work so well together. ",

      "title": "I saw my rapist at a wedding last weekend and now old trauma came back and I’m mad at myself for not turning him in.",
      "selftext": "So about 7 years ago (I was young I was only 20) me and my ex broke up for a few months and I moved into an apartment with just me and my son. We were broke up for about a month and I ran into a guy I went to high school with at a party. We hit it off and started hanging out and hooking up on weekends I didn’t have my son. I noticed the times we would hook up he would like rough kind of sex, which I didn’t mind because I do like a little hair pulling and handcuffs as long as I’m comfortable and I have a safe word to use if it gets too much. There was a few times he was too hard pulling my hair or would choke me a little too hard and I would say the safe word or try and get him to stop and he would just keep going. I mentioned afterward like “hey I didn’t like how hard you were pulling or choking me can you do it a little easier next time, I tried to say during.” And he would just say “oh sorry I guess I got a little carried away in the moment.” Just stuff like that.\n\nWell one night he asked if he could come over on a work night (my son was at his grandmas) and I told him no I had to be up at 5:30 for work the next day and I was exhausted from work that day. He begged and begged me to come over he said “we don’t have to do anything we can just cuddle and sleep” after like the 3rd time asking I finally gave in and told him yeah but we were just going to watch tv and sleep. He agreed and came over. I was laying on my side facing the tv and he was cuddled up behind me spooning me. We were watching a movie and the whole time he keep trying to touch me and I keep pushing him off saying “no not tonight I don’t want to.” He just keep on and keep on finally I got annoyed and told him if he’s not going to stop then he needs to leave because I had already told him prior to coming over I didn’t want to do anything and told him no about 10 times. \n\nAfter I said that he rolled me over onto my stomach and got on top of me, I was yelling and tried pushing him off. He slid my my pants and panties down while holding me down and I could feel how turned on he was with me fighting him. He spit in his hand and put it on himself and inserted himself in my ass… yelp absolutely no lube and I had only done it with my ex once so it was extremely painful. I was screaming crying telling him to get off me and tried pushing him off and he grabbed my left arm an put it behind my back and held it and he took his right arm and put it over my mouth where I couldn’t scream. The more I would scream and fight the harder he would go and the tighter he would hold me. \n\nAfter he finished he got off and I jumped up with tears and just started screaming cussing at him saying “what the fuck” and to “get the fuck out.” He looked at me dead in the eyes and said “sorry I thought you liked it rough.” And “the more you fight me the more turned on I get it’s hot.” I again told him to leave he started apologizing but ended up leaving and I locked the door behind him. I was completely in shock. I went to the bathroom and realized I was bleeding and just broke down. I ended up going to my ex because I had no one else to turn to. I didn’t really have friends, not close enough to talk to about this anyway. My mom lives hours away and we weren’t that close. My ex tried to get me to call the cops but I was too embarrassed. \n\nA week later I went up to visit my mom and told her what had happened and asked if I should call the cops. She told me “well if you guys were actively  having sex I’m not sure if you would consider this rape.” This made me feel even more embarrassed and made me feel like it was my fault and I just felt stupid. So I ended up just keeping it to myself and only my ex and my mom knew about it. I ended up just moving on with my life and moved on from it. \n\nFast forward to last weekend I was at a friend’s wedding and I saw him there. He was some how either friends or related to the groom and when I saw his face all those old memories came flooding back in. I told my now boyfriend about it and said we could leave if I wanted. I ended up staying for the wedding and leaving right after because I couldn’t stand to see his face. Now I regret not calling the cops and turning him in because he gets to live life happy with no consequences and I have to live with this trauma forever. It also makes me feel like him saying it turned him on that I fought him makes me wonder if he’s done this to other women because he clearly enjoys it. I don’t know it’s just been in my head ever since last weekend. ",

      "selftext": "Last night my girlfriend and I were talking about her best friend's relationship...she described some ways that her friend treats her SO with disrespect and that things didn't seem to be working. My mind immediately went to her respect for him sexually as this is pretty telltale. Eventually we started talking about size and my girlfriend busted out laughing and said \"she said he's small!\".....well, there you go. No surprises there. At all. So I told my girlfriend that yeah, if she's saying things to her girlfriends where if he was in the same room and heard it, they would NOT be together...and her friend circle is at least amused at his (unknowing) humiliation, then she has little respect for him as a man and obviously things are not gonna go well in the relationship. So anyway, yeah, they talk about it, and yeah, size matters in case you wondered. They see it as a bonus if it's big and they often (but not always) can not respect the man or treat him with respect if it's noticeably small.",

But it seems it is affecting our marriage a bit too much. We have too very young children and he never makes it to anything. Daycare Christmas event? Emergency at the plant ( I work at the same plant so I know he wasn't lying though). Easter party at the daycare? He didn't make it. Fathers day celebration at the daycare? He didn't make it. \nI know the situation at the plant is not ideal. With what is happening all around Europe, sales in car industry dropped, he has to send people home. But he runs the home like he runs the plant: strict rules, having a plan for everything. If some guests say they will be here at 2 PM and they make it at 3 he is irritated.\nI tried talking to him. I asked him directly: you are literally the plant manager. Top hierarchy. What do you want now? You are still not at peace.\nHe shrugged and simply said: I want more. \n Yesterday I got all dolled up, cooked him his favourite meal, make up, nice lingerie, lotions, hair done because he had a very bad day at work. Some subordinates didnt respect the deadlines and he lost it.  \nHe said he is not in the mood. I asked: and how can I help? what can I do for you? His answer was thst he put his forehead on his palms and said he cannot take it anymore. What? I insisted. Is it me? Have I done something? And he said its not me. Its work.\nWhat to do?",

      "selftext": "Real life is so much worse than I ever imagined as a kid. Indeed, if my mother could’ve known how I our lives would turn out, she would’ve had an abortion. I’m so surprised that life ended up being filled with so much failure and misery. I understand difficulty, but I don’t understand absolute waste of time.\n\nEverything that’s happening is a waste of time. I put my heart & soul into work & art, only to discover that I’m not allowed to pursue my career nor my dreams lest I be reminded that I don’t deserve money nor recognition because I’m a piece of shit. What doesn’t make sense is that there are tons of people around me who are even bigger scumbags than me, and yet they have far better lives.\n\nI was banned from my San Francisco open mic community because of my “behavior towards women.” Bullshit. I was always respectful towards everyone, never preying on nor in any way taking advantage of women. What happened is that several women (and men) abused or otherwise violated me in some manner, and my outspoken way of responding gave them reason to cry victim.\n\nIt’s a timeless, stupid story. For example, at the open mics, a 53 year-old woman regularly approached me, love-bombing me like a typical borderline psychopath. On multiple occasions, she approached, grabbed me by the collar, and kissed me on the lips. I never consented, but I also felt flattered and didn’t want to be mean. However, imagine a man doing that to a woman.\n\nIf a man did what this woman did, he would be viewed as a disgusting abuser. Across my three years of knowing this person, I made it very clear that I only wanted a platonic friendship. She abided - until she didn’t. Several times, in the middle of positive conversations where I felt safe, she would ask me if she could give me a blowjob. Again, imagine a man asking a woman to blow him. I felt disrespected and violated.\n\nAs time passed and she became more obsessive, sending 5-10 minutes worth of audio messages every day, I started to push her away. I chose to share some details about myself that I assumed would turn her off. Yes, it worked. Eventually, she entered the discard phase of BPD, devaluing me until she went too far. One night, we were having a friendly audio message exchange when she randomly said, “you’re too arrogant for your age. You aren’t as wise as you think you are.”\n\nNow, wait a minute. This was at 1am while I was on break at work. Why is she suddenly insulting me? I asked for a specific example of what she meant, and she said, “I’m going to bed.” I was so pissed off because here I am trying to work and suddenly this woman who claims to love me is degrading me - and she won’t elaborate? Wow. She knew I was working and struggling. Why leave me hanging? She wanted me to have a bad evening. I was so mad that I sent several audio messages calling her out. I even called 988 crisis support, and they agreed that this woman was abusing me like a BPD. It was a terrible night with no sleep.\n\nA few days later, she sent a 6 minutes audio message (she knew my limit was 2 minutes) saying that I don’t have a heart - that my heart is dead. Wow. She knew my mother had recently dropped dead. She knew I spent hours supporting her while she was in the hospital and while she took care of her mother who had dementia. How does someone give hours of time and support, being called a great therapist, and all of a sudden he has no heart?\n\nIt’s called Borderline Personality Disorder. This woman went through all of the phases: love-bombing, splitting, devaluation, & discarding. You’ll say that I should’ve gotten away from her. One of my problems is that I’m too nice. I tolerated her sexual assault and harassment; I tolerated her obsessive, daily messages. I tolerated all of her cruelty and abuse. All of my kindness and support meant nothing to her.\n\nI was so upset at her that I lashed out with endless voicemails, calling her out for her behavior. It was my way of cathartically coping with the trauma. She responded by playing victim, going to people in our community and telling them I’m the one who abused her. I don’t even know the entirety of what she said to people. For all I know, she told them that I sexually harassed her. I don’t know.\n\nBut I do know is that I got permanently banned from the entire community as a result of this individual and several others who behaved in similar ways. I have a propensity for putting up with disordered behavior, and it always comes back to harm me. In no way did I initially go after any of these people. I was upset and lashed out verbally after they harmed me. Of course, this woman is still allowed to go to the open mics and perform; and I’m not allowed to perform anymore. Why is that fair? Oh, is it because she’s a woman and I’m a man?\n\nI can’t win either way. I’ve lost my ability to perform in the entire San Francisco Bay area. I am viewed as some sort of abuser who treats women badly. I asked two hosts in the open mic community why I’m permanently banned. One of them said, “you need to learn to love yourself.” The second host said, “you need to look past yourself.” A third host told me that the ban is unfair and that I am a model citizen at the mics.\n\nHow does that make any sense? If the ban is about my behavior toward women, then what does me loving myself have anything to do with it? If it was about my behavior toward women, then they would have said that. They would’ve said that I’m banned because I am a danger to women. They didn’t say that. So, what’s going on? Why is this woman still allowed to perform and I’m not? Is this some sort of reparations for women? It doesn’t make any sense.\n\nI hate this world. Nobody ever asked me for my side of the story. How can these people know that I’m a threat to women if they don’t even know what happened? It’s because the borderline psychopaths play victim, and then the stupid people believe them. It is a very common pattern and human history. This 53-year-old woman, for example does not have the maturity to apologize to me or to extend any sort of olive branch after three years of me treating her with kindness.\n\nBorderline personality is so difficult to deal with because these people will split on you. Once they’ve split, every good deed is completely forgotten. All of the love turns to hate. Sadly, now that my stupid community thinks that I’m a threat to women when in fact, I am one of the kindest and most decent men you’ll ever find, I feel so traumatized that I I’m scared that I’m going to hurt myself. Sadly, my life is gone. I’ve spent the last year and a half trying to repent so that I can return to my community. I even apologized to this abusive 53-year-old woman.\n\nI can’t believe I apologized. All that does it make her think that I actually did something bad. I hate the fact that nobody asked for my side of the story. The saddest thing of all is that my mother is gone, my life is gone, and I have no way to fix this. My self-esteem is gone knowing that a bunch of idiots think I’m some sort of threat to women. Meanwhile, there are tons of men out there today who are going to rape some woman or take advantage of her in some way that is disrespectful, demeaning, and down right cruel. They will suffer no consequences.\n\nMost of you will say that I’m just some sort of pathetic man who should’ve been grateful that girls were making sexual advances toward me and that it’s all my fault that I’m in this situation because I’m just a piece of shit loser who didn’t know how to handle situations as well. Fine. I get it. Lashing out at these people for abusing me and treating me like garbage wasn’t a smart strategy. I should’ve taken the high road and simply said that I don’t appreciate their advances. I should’ve reported their abuse to the hosts.\n\nI really wish I could still have a future. It sucks fitting her knowing that the past year has been a total waste of time. It sucks, knowing that my family is gone, my community is gone, and there’s no way to fix this. Sadly, my love for life is gone. I’m afraid that I’m going to hurt myself because I just don’t wanna be here anymore. Decency does not exist anymore.\n\nNow, go ahead and crucify me for playing victim and tell me how much you want me to kill myself. I spent 8 months this year in therapy, talking to my therapist 2 times per week. He concluded services last month because he determined that I met my therapy goals. So, I don’t know what else to do.",

      "selftext": "I've dealt with treatment-resistant depression for many years, starting when I was a teenager. A few months ago, I finally found something that worked to combat it, and I was so relieved it practically brought me to tears. I could finally just enjoy being in the moment and actually feel like I'm living life.\n\nBut, after a few months, I've realized that now that I'm not depressed, I have some new problems. I don't recognize myself, for one - it's like I had so much of \"me\" tied up in depression that it being gone leaves a gap in who I am that I'm not sure how to fill. Things that used to bring me comfort don't feel the same anymore. Relationships I thought were stable and healthy feel like they were only stable because I never said or did anything to rock the boat because I was so scared of losing that stability, and thought it was selfish to want anything more than someone who was willing to put up with me.\n\nI never had regrets while I was depressed, just like I never had hopes or dreams. Life simply...was, and every day was just another day to make it through without giving up. But now, I realize I missed so many opportunities that I can't get back. That there were things I didn't pursue when I was younger that I won't get another chance to. That the years of my life where it was ok to try new things and make mistakes without all the pressures of being deep in a career and having so many obligations are long gone, and not coming back. And for the first time in my life, I regret not really living life for all those years when I had the chance.\n\nI don't know what I want out of life, or how to even begin to figure that out. I don't know how to fill the gaps that depression left when I finally evicted it. I'm not depressed anymore, but I don't think I'm happy either. And I'm terrified that if I don't figure it out and make some progress, the depression is going to inevitably creep its way back in, and I don't ever want to go back to THAT.",

      "selftext": "Hey guys, I'm here to share some part of my life or maybe the way I'm living right now too haha. \n\nSo, I've issues with myself regarding vision. I don't know if it's a disorder or a sight problem, the thing with me is I can't see anything clearly written as long as the written part is brought near to my eyes. it's not like I'm seeing everything and everyone in blurred way, I can see clearly not as 1080p nor 144p it's in between. im suffering this since a child. my parents are so toxic and narcissistic that they won't accept their child has a problem. \nI used to write mistakes in my book as I can't see, I used to get slapped for not writing the right way, get insulted and get those judgemental looks by teachers, students etc. one of my teacher in second grade who used to scold me everyday came to me and asked me to call my parents. she told everything to my parents and my parents were like no problem at all. my child is fine. I explained to my parents and they were like nothing is wrong with you, shut it. You won't go blind. \nI used to ask my teachers to dictate instead of writing on board, they ignored me lol. \nin third grade, few staff came to check eye sight. I can't see so that's what I said. even if they changed lenses and no matter what the lens I  wasn't able to see lol😂😭. \nand then my friends teachers and those staff were looking at me with those insulting judgemental looks, fuck I got scared like I'm some sort of weirdo. \nI got humiliated by my relatives that I wasn't able to read texts Properly until and unless they're kept near me. we don't have enough money to go for a checkup either and of course my parents aren't willing to get me a checkup haha. Friends used to help me but in a judging manner that was when I was in school. but now in college I've a friend who helps with no such feelings which makes me a bit normal haha. I always felt alone carrying this weight of being a weirdo in class.  When I was so young like in 4-6 grades, I used to cry not knowing what was happening with me. Parents are saying something, teachers are saying other things which i am the one suffering. Somehow I went through them and still surviving. \nWell, with all of this I managed to get 95% in school and 93% in the high school (11-12) and 81 percentile in JEE mains..and a good rank of 13k in my state exam which gave me a decent college to study and now I'm pursuing my engineering degree. \nThe only thing I fear during exams was about my vision \" what if they wont dictate questions\" \" what if I can't see the room no. clearly\" \" what if I can't see my Hall ticket number \" and lot more. It was never what if I'm not able to write anything in the paper. 😂😂\nI still don't know if it's a vision problem or else a vision disorder. I'm just living with it. I'll probably get a job within 2-4 years and buy my own shit I guess.. And I got a test of physics, he said he'll write questions on board I'm dead again. 😂😂\nI just hope someone will help me through that time. \n",

      "selftext": "I'm a 19yo girl and I currently have no friends whatsoever.\nI'm not an antisocial person, not even introverted; actually I'm really outgoing and I love talking to people.\n\nWhen I was a child I was extremely bullied and isolated, it all came from the fact that I'm gifted (I think that's the correct term, I'm not an English speaker) therefore I have always been quite different from the people my age. I had to leave school for a while.\n\nIt took many years but I overcome the trauma and became extroverted and friendly, I had many friends over the years.\n\nTwo years ago, I started art school and got bullied again, I wasn't able to fight back and was so depressed that I left school again and stopped talking to everyone, that's how I lost all of my friends, slowly.\n\nThis year I came back to finish my last year with a new class. They are all very kind, but all of them have their friend groups and they aren't very interested in forming deep connections. I have taken the iniciative to make plans, but it didn't lead to much. They are very kind, but just casual classmates.\n\n\nI was doing good until now that I got quite sick and I've been in bed, without anything to do for a few days. I feel so terribly isolated and lonely. I know this is just temporary but it's so hard. I need friends. I need people to have a coffee and chat. I need people to take a walk and share different opinions. I need to go out and party, or go to the park, or the mall, or anything.\nI just need a friend. I crave a friend group.\n\nI'm not sure of what to do. I'm in my last year and don't have the time to find activities in my area, not that there's much to do here anyway.\nI'm not into videogames nor do I have a computer of my own.\n\nI have spent the last few days in bed, only dumb scrolling through Reddit and Instagram for many, many hours. This reminds me so much if the years I spent dealing with depression and literally rotting in bed while I was a child and preteen and it's driving my crazy.",

There was this game called Chibi Pocket that I used to play all the time on my iPad when I was twelve. I played it for nearly a year,it was a game where you could customize a chibi character and talk to people online.\n\nI lied about being sixteen in the game and got into a kind of “relationship” with someone there. Later, I ‘cheated’ on him with another person, and the first guy said something like ‘I’ll log out,’ and after that, he disappeared.\n\nEver since, I’ve sometimes worried that maybe he hurt himself because of me. Could it just be my mind overthinking? I ask because when I was cheated on in that same game once, I ended up hurting myself. I was too young to really understand the consequences back then, but I can’t stop thinking about it now that I’m 18\n\nI just want to get this off my chest and maybe hear some thoughts, thank you🤍",

      "title": "I’m 18, married, in college, and taking my grandmother to probate court.",
      "selftext": "I don’t really know where to start. I guess I just need to get this off my chest.\n\nI’m 18 years old. Recently married. In college. Trying to build a future while dealing with the fallout of the family I had to escape from.\n\nI grew up in an abusive home. My father was controlling and cruel. My mother pretended not to see it, and when she did, she twisted everything to make me the problem. There was never peace in that house. Just walking on eggshells, waiting for the next explosion.\n\nSince I was seven, I had one goal: to become an officer in the United States Army. That goal became my lifeline. It was the one thing that gave me direction when everything else was chaos.\n\nNow, I’m finally doing it. I’m a cadet at Norwich University, on a four year Army ROTC scholarship. I wake up before sunrise to train, study hard, and push myself to be the kind of leader I needed when I was a kid.\n\nBut getting here wasn’t clean or easy.\n\nWhen I turned 18 a couple months ago, I laid everything out to my parents. I told them I had never trusted them, and that they stamped out whatever familial love I had for them at a young age when they abused my brother. My parents tried one last time to control me, and they're still making attempts. While I'm stuck in the Corp at college I get a call from their attorney, \"Your parents are instructing you to facilitate the removal their personal effects from their property immediately or they will pursue eviction\". I had left for college on the 16th of August, and they have spread lies about me to relatives. I still get messages and voicemails telling me how awful I am, and that me and my wife would be better off dead.\n\nThen came the part I didn’t expect.\n\nMy grandmother, someone who had always claimed to support me, revoked my access to my custodial brokerage account. That account held over seventy percent of my net worth. Money that was legally mine the moment I turned 18. I’d been responsible with it for years. I used it to invest, to plan for my future, to make sure I never had to rely on the same people who hurt me.\n\nAnd she just… locked me out. No warning. No explanation. Just silence and control.\n\nSo now, I’m taking my own grandmother to probate court. Not because I’m greedy, but because this is about principle. About standing up for myself when people expect me to stay quiet. That money represents my independence, my proof that I’m finally in charge of my own life.\n\nMeanwhile, I’m holding everything else together. My wife 18F, is my partner in all of this. We'd been dating for 7 years throughout this whole ordeal and just recently married by a pastor with no one else present. She’s type 1 diabetic and spent the last year and a half in foster care, abandoned by her \"family\". She’s on a full ride with a stipend and already planning her financial future. She’s the strongest person I know. Together, we’re working, saving, investing, and building a stable life out of nothing.\n\nIt’s not easy. Some days, it feels like the world is testing how much more I can take. But every morning, I wake up knowing I’m free, no one owns me anymore. Soon I will be out of this. Soon I'll be truly free.\n\nI’ve faced manipulation, emotional abuse, eviction threats, and now financial betrayal from my own blood. But I’m still here. Still standing.\n\nI’m not rich. I’m not done. But I’m almost free, and that’s something no one can take from me again.",

      "title": "I just wanted a quiet moment with my baby, and it turned into a huge fight with my wife",
      "selftext": "I don’t really know where to start, but I just need to get this off my chest.\n\nMy wife and I have been married for about five years, and we have a baby who’s not even a year old yet. We both work full-time. I’ve got a standard 9-5 Monday to Friday job, while her shifts rotate, usually also a standard 9-5, Monday to Friday but sometimes she works nights or weekends. We have a nanny during my work hours, and we try our best to split baby duties and chores evenly. I technically make a bit more, but we share finances and make decisions together.\n\nWhen things are good between us, they’re really good. But when they’re bad, it feels like we can’t stop the spiral. We’ve had way more good moments than bad, but lately it feels like we’ve been stuck in one of those rough patches. We’re actually about to start marriage counseling soon because we both want to make things work. I know I’m not perfect, but I really do love my wife and our little family more than anything.\n\nAnyway, this happened a few nights ago.\nIt was a normal Tuesday evening. My wife wanted to go to an event and asked if I’d come along with her and bring the baby so we could all spend time together. I went, watched her, took care of the baby, cheered her on, and honestly, we made some nice memories together.\n\nWhen we got home, it was time for the baby’s feeding. I suggested she feed him while I grabbed a quick bite, I’d skipped lunch after working out and was starving and then I’d take over, change and clean the baby while she ate.\n\nAfter I finished dinner, she handed me the baby in our bedroom. I lay down, snuggling and playing with him, just soaking in that moment. He was giggling, grabbing my face, and it was one of those small, peaceful moments that make all the exhaustion worth it.\n\nAs I was lying there, my wife started to leave and said, “Now that you’ve had dinner, will you and the baby come to the living room while I eat?” But before I could even respond, she added, “Since you make me feel so alone and ignore me.”\n\nIt hit me out of nowhere. The evening had been fine, we’d both been in good spirits, and I genuinely didn’t understand where that came from. I told her there was no need for that comment, I was just taking a minute with our baby before joining her.\nThen everything just… exploded.\nShe said I never spend time with her (which isn’t true, I’ve been home all week after working while she’s been working nights, and we literally spent the whole weekend together, just us, with no distractions. We even had a lovely dinner together on Monday). Then it escalated fast. She said some really hurtful things, told me she’d tell our friends I’m a terrible husband, that she’d tell our son the same when he’s older. She called me “disgusting” and “lowly.”\n\nI mostly stayed quiet. I didn’t want to argue while holding the baby, and honestly, I was just too tired. But she kept going, even coming back into the room to accuse me of things that aren’t true, like checking out other women. Then she told me to leave the house.\nI didn’t leave, I just stayed there with our baby until things calmed down.\n\nThe thing is, I wasn’t trying to ignore her. I wasn’t trying to make her feel alone. I was just tired, happy, and wanted a short, quiet moment with my kid before joining her for dinner - I didn't even think about it, it was just natural to cosy up with baby once she passed him to me. But somehow, it turned into a fight that left me completely drained.\n\nI love her, and I know she’s been through a lot, especially after having the baby. But I don’t know how to keep doing this cycle where something so small turns into something so cruel.\n\nI just needed to let this out somewhere.\n\n\n\nUpdate:\n\nLet me be clear, she did not work an event, it was a small social gathering that she helped organize but it was very low maintenance. It was fun and required no work but I wanted her to not have to worry about baby duties and attending to us all the time so I gave her space when she needed as I wanted her to have her time with people as one of the hosts.\n\nPeople are also mentioning whether she is exhausting and / or if I am not pulling my weight. Our nanny makes our life relatively easy if I am honest in terms of chores. Our home is quite small so easy to maintain. Our baby sleeps well so we rest very well each day relatively. I would say I am with the baby 60/40 compared to her just because she might have to work a irregular shift and we don't have the nanny at that time. I do not mind that at all. Moreover, I encourage her to be social and exercise even if that means I am at home with baby.\n\nLastly I mentioned that I earn a bit more to provide context and to stop people assuming that I am not pulling my weight. I earn a fair amount which meant she did not have to work and we own our own home. She is only working because she wanted to maintain her identity and career, it is not out of necessity.",

      "selftext": "I met him at university, we were in the same group project. He had my back when someone tried to take credit for my work. After the project, we would text and talk from time to time, sometimes about deep stuff but for the most part we stayed in our lanes. I supported him through a tough time for him about a year after we met and he gave me a Christmas present that year as a thanks, and that was kind of it.\n\nThe winter before our last year at school, I tried to convince him to go to the work winter party (it was a lot of fun and I genuinely just wanted all my friends to have fun!) but he didn’t bite. He asked me how it was a couple days later and I told him I met someone and asked him if he knew the guy (they work in the same building). He did, and encouraged me to pursue it. (unfortunately that never worked out for me lol) I asked him about his dating life in return and he mentioned going on a date with someone he met on the apps. Of course I supported it.\n\nFast forward to the end of summer when we went back to school, I hadn’t seen him in probably a year irl, and it was awkward to make conversation? Like I’d ask about his gf and his job and his future plans like you would with any friend and he would give me absolutely nothing. Also, at this point we had mutual friends that we played badminton with at uni so it wasn’t like we could just avoid each other just because it was awkward. Around this time I noticed him making mean comments, just generally making fun of me for no reason. I talked to my friend about this and she thought it was weird because he didn’t really say this kind of stuff to her or our other friends. I really struggled with this because I knew I wasn’t going to talk to him about it, I would either just try to talk to other people while we were playing badminton, or just softly exit the group so I didn’t have to deal with it.\n\nI tried to call it off as just awkwardness. Eventually, I think we warmed up to each other with time (also helped that we had other friends around to be buffers). Things really changed when we ended up in another group project again, it was also around the time his gf got into an accident. She was hurt pretty badly and it affected her schooling. It also affected how much they saw each other, he was pretty vague with the details which made me think she wasn’t giving him all the details.\n\nAbout a month later, we were pretty much neck deep into the project, calling each other quite often to figure out the project as we had dead weights in our group and knew it was up to us to get the project done well. Normally, I’d get tired of seeing someone that much but he was so nice to me and I felt so understood (especially since the same guy who tried to take credit for my work was in our group again. seriously, profs need to stop using alphabetical order as a way to assign groups). I’m not really sure when it changed to a more personal relationship, but I guess we would talk about things while we worked.\n\nI was pretty cognizant of the fact that he had a gf, and would avoid playing badminton if it was only him that was available, but when it came to the project, it just helped that he was around. I needed someone to just be on call to do any work with how burned out I was. And this translated to other classes too, I’d call my other friends to get studying done. Call it codependency.\n\nWe talked about relationships a few times, even that guy from the Christmas party, but at this point I was in such an unhealthy place that I told him I just wasn’t ready. It felt like normal conversation, until it wasn’t.\n\nHe would say all these double entendres which I tried to brush off as unintentional. Throughout the years esp when we were talking about my relationship status, he would tell me things like “all you have to do is walk up to any guy and ask them for their number, any guy would want to date you”. To be fair, this was before he was dating someone. And then after he met his gf, when I was saying I’m not ready for a relationship because already I feel like a bad friend where I can’t really put in time and effort that other people deserve, he reminded me that I deserved to be loved and that even if I can’t give that time and effort it didn’t mean that other people wouldn’t want to give that to me. Where things really changed for me is when he made a “where were you two years ago” comment which he clarified before he met his gf. It was just an off comment while we were warming up and I tried to ignore it. He’s also said “do you know how much I love you” fairly casually, sometimes in a group setting (to which my friend would say “huh you can’t say that you have a gf”) and sometimes on call when it was just us working on the group project. To be honest, I think this comment was less concerning because the tone was definitely more like a joke. Yeah, he shouldn’t be saying this stuff to begin with but it also didn’t clue me in to the fact that he was thinking about other people while in a relationship like the other comments. This is just my take on things that were said a long time ago, like maybe my recollection isn’t perfect and maybe he didn’t mean it that way. To be honest, I forget what else he said but while I make it sound one sided it absolutely wasn’t.\n\nI definitely called him when I didn’t need to because I liked talking to him. I had recently fell out with someone very important in my life and while I’m not proud of it, it was most certainly a coping mechanism to always be with someone or calling someone. I could never really picture anything physical with him (then again I can’t picture that with anyone) but at that point felt fairly emotionally dependant, like his presence made my life easier. A terrible confession, but while I was processing the loss of a relationship with someone who was important in my life, I would stare at my ceiling and wish he was holding me so I didn’t feel so alone.\n\nWhen the project ended, I finally confided in a friend about how it feels like he’s cheating on his gf but also how I’ve been enabling it and she really did me a solid and told me straight up it is cheating and even though I claim it’s enabling, it takes two to cheat and I’m very much part of the problem. I took her advice and ended up not saying anything to him after the project and in his defence, he didn’t say much either.\n\nI found out that his gf recently refused to talk to him and the breakup was literally her ghosting him. She literally lied about being in another country so she wouldn’t have to talk to him about it which is wild but also funny.\n\nThrough out this weird post-project phase, I’ve felt so much guilt, I’ve thought about telling her. During the project, I encouraged him to bring his gf to badminton or anything outside school so we could meet her, partly because it was something I would do for any of my friends and partly because I needed to remind myself that she existed.\n\nI still feel terrible about what happened and sometimes I still miss him but I know for sure even though he’s broken up this is a possibility I will never explore. How you get em is how you lose em.\n\nIf I could go back, I’d tell past me to just talk to my friends. Best advice I got is if you’re oversharing to the wrong people it means you’re not sharing enough to the right people. They would’ve been there to support me if I’d told them about what I was going through. When I finally confided in my friends it was about the guy and this cheating situation and not even the other loss in my life. And I changed a lot of details so they hopefully wouldn’t know who it was, like I was trying to protect his identity or something idk. Either way super messy just relieved it’s over\n",

About a month ago the family I have been staying with decided that internet is a luxury, and have taken access away. Two days ago I got a call back for a stay-home job, they asked for a few details about internet speeds, when I asked for access again so I could give the job an answer I was told that wasn’t an option. I’ve been told this whole time any job is acceptable. I haven’t been choosy with my applications. The one that called me was in my desired career field, but was not acceptable for some reason.

      "selftext": "I thought I was fine with leaving it all behind and starting a new life. I thought moving out of this toxic household was all I wanted, and I was not so pleasantly surprised when every attempt for moving out didn't work out. Turns out a part of me didn't want to let go; she wanted a family, belonging, and most importantly, love. That's why I always unconsciously held back and self-sabotaged.   \nI noticed that I'm addicted to that tiny amount of love and belonging that I get after being put through hell. It's a cycle and it's a vicious one. It's like a tumor growing inside, it gets worse and worse every day and I know that I don't take it out it would kill me one day, but damn isn't it so damn difficult.   \nMy feelings towards them include a mix of anger, resentment, guilt, shame, and eventually love. I know I'm plagued with their disease, the disease that they choose willingly to have everyday, but a part of me can't help but ache to save them from themselves. It just never ends. I know I can't save them, or at least not as long as I'm here with them, but can't help but want to.   \nI'm already depleted, I give so much and yet receive so little. I get called selfish and heartless while doing everything in my power to make them feel loved. I put thought into every action, I try to see what's for their highest good and do just that. I see them and feel them, but that's not what I get in return.   \nThey never see me or hear me or feel me, they never did. They only perceive me through their own pain and hurt, their own judgment that's clouded with fear and illusion.   \nI don't wanna get caught in this trap, where I sacrifice my life and my youth for them and still get no credits at the end.  \nIt's not even the credits that I care about, it's that satisfaction that comes from giving love, from seeing your loved ones flourish and be happy. But as you may have already guessed, that's not what usually happens. It's like feeding a bottomless pit, no matter how much feed it, it's never enough. It's never enough to fix their problems cause that's deeply rooted in the system itself. I can't catch all the rotten apples being thrown at me at the same time; I can't fix all the issues my father has caused and actively continues to cause. I can only stand there and take damage along with other family members, maybe take a little more so others don't feel it as much.  \nIt's even more difficult cause I have this little angel as my sister and I know she looks up to me. Even the thought of leaving her in this hellhole tears me apart, but that doesn't mean that I'm happy staying here to protect her and suffer with her. I know that the best thing to do is to grow independent and help her when I'm actually established and capable.   \nWith all that being said, I'm still an addict. I'm addicted to those brief moments of wholeness and belonging that I get with them, after working so damn hard for it.",

I(16F) am a compulsive liar and sometimes I don't even realise why I do it. Maybe it stems from my childhood and trauma that I've faced and I do it as a form of self preservation and people pleasing and the need for validation and to be included but it has ruined my friendships. I have lost 3 major friends in the span of 3 years. The first friendship mainly broke because of the toxic dynamics that arose because it was difficult to navigate the trust after I realised that my friend was lying to me and I confronted her about it. Long story short, she flipped things on me and boom, friendship broken because of my 'toxic traits'. Friendship 2 broke because I felt the constant need to be superior and made the other person feel small. Then, I found out that she gossiped about me and stupid 14yo me did it back to her but it backfired because she had a friendgroup to back her up and I did not and I realised how morally wrong my actions were. Friendship 3 broke due to my history of lying and manipulation which got to her because she felt like the friendship was demanding. Friendship 4 broke because of a major deception/lie that I told and it completely shattered the minimal trust that we had built. I'm trying to change and other than this big lie I told, I have not been compulsively lying for over 1.5 years. But this incident kind of undid my efforts and reverted my back to stage 0. I'm trying so hard to change but sometimes, my personal situation forces me to lie or over share my trauma to explain myself and demeanor which leads to friendships being emotionally draining for the other person. Anyway, I just needed to get that off my chest. My guilt has been eating me up recently. ",

And if I could tell my prof I have it maybe he’d give me more time on deadlines and maybe my grades would be better so maybe I can get a better job.\n\nIdk man I'm so shocked I still have to think about this.\n",

      "title": "UPDATE: I think my husband had an emotional affair, and I'll never know the truth",
      "selftext": "NEW UPDATE:\n\nHi All,\n\nI've read through all the comments and did some thinking. I realize that I stuck my whole damn leg in my mouth, but I was so caught up in the heat of the moments. I guess it was a mix of me being on new medication, anger that my husband would not just tell her to fuck off, and me trying to set the picture of me not being anything close to jealous. I realize my mistake, and it is what it is.\n\nTo those saying fake, I don't really care, that's why I posted on a venting sub. \n\nEven though things are going better now, and we are in therapy, I still hold resentment because he outright refused to block her while she lived in the estate, saying \"What if there's an emergency? I can't block a tenant.\" and he refused to call her out on her behaviour because \"he doesn't want drama\". I respect his decision, but it still hurts. We've been together for nearly 10 years and I tell him that sometimes I feel he cares about other people's emotions more than mine. I pretty much am just keeping a low profile now, spending time with my son and trying to focus on the happiness that I do have. Whatever decisions he makes now going forward, I will address it when it happens. I was not in a good mental space when this whole thing happened, am I am growing as a person and learning to control my emotions. Also to control what I just blurt out when I am upset. \n\nThank you for everyone's input. It's not healthy for me to keep dwelling on this. I am moving on now. Whether my husband wants to move on with me, or keep to his old ways... I'll cross that bridge when I get there. And I have a plan for IF things do go sideways.\n\nThank you all.\n\nUpdate:\n\nI managed to see the messages between them. Nothing of a sexual nature at all, not even flirty. There was a day where he texted her at 07h30, but only texted me at 09h45 after I had sent him a text at 06h50, but that's as bad as it gets... He does not know that I've seen the texts so I've kept it quiet.\n\nWe had a massive fight a few days after I made the original post, and I told him that I am considering separation. I think that made him realize how serious this all is. It's pretty much a blur, but I've started going to therapy to deal with past traumas and I am on antidepressants. C joined me in my last session and I think he realizes what B's intentions were, as my male psychologist said that that was very unusual behaviour from her, that \"she is a threat and has intentions\"\n\nC and I are doing great now, but the reason why I am posting this update, is to show what B said to me after I decided to send her a message to bury the hatchet and move on. These are the texts:\n\nMe :Dear B,\nI wanted to share what’s been on my mind. I was genuinely glad when we first met. It felt like I’d found someone new with a similar personality, and I thought there was potential for a real friendship.\nBut as time has passed, I’ve felt hurt and disrespected by some of your choices. As someone who has also experienced betrayal, I would have hoped you’d understand how it came across when you frequently visited my husband while I wasn’t home, yet never came when I was there. You had opportunities to build a friendship with me too.\nI’ve just had a baby, and during such a vulnerable time it was especially difficult seeing how often you reached out to C for help. Certain things, like your son calling him “dada”, crossed lines that made me deeply uncomfortable. I tried to brush off a lot, but when you avoided coming by during the days I was home, only to return the moment I was back at work, it became impossible to ignore.\nI’ve spoken to C about his role in this, but as a woman, I also expected you to recognize when enough was enough. In my position, I believe you would have felt the same way.\nI’ve acknowledged everything now and I’m moving forward. Whether it was you seeking attention or C enjoying it, I was willing to let things go, until both of your actions crossed into what I can only call unacceptable.\n\nB then sent a long voice note detailing how it wasn’t her intention to hurt me, how she just naturally gravitates towards men, bla blah, and how me being an introvert she just didn’t wanna be in my space, blah blah blah.\nThen sent “I really like you guys and hope we can still be friends. But In saying that I will respect the boundaries and your wishes.”\n\nMe: I appreciate your message\n\nB: Soooo is that a yes we can be friends?\n\nMe: If I'm honest, I still hold a lot of resentment. Mainly because what he was freely giving you, attention and effort, i was begging for and not receiving. He tried his best to reach a compromise with me, telling me that you were over one day to ask advice because you met someone at a bar and wanted his opinion if the guy is interested or not. So I received a lot of mixed stories, because I remember you saying that you're happy being single and not looking. \nI am working through my emotions, as I have a lot of unresolved trauma, and C's constant defending you left a very bad taste in my mouth. I don't know if it would be possible while we are still working on things, as this has caused a very big rift between us.\n\nI realized my mistake here when I gave her a good feeling because my husband defended her.\n\nThe next part she sent a bunch of texts.\n\nB: C defended me because he wanted you to realize him and I are good friends\n\nB: I dont want to be that person but I do think you need to take a step back and also put yourself in our shoes.\n\nB: You have a good husband who loves you and your son and wants yo build a beautiful life with you guys but you can't allow insecurities or misunderstandings to interfere with that.\n\nB: Work on things that's fine but dont push someone away that is wanting to be both your friends.\n\nB: Take time to think. I won't push it.\n\nB: What i mean by this is to trust your husband. He is incredibly loyal to you. But he is a social, helpful person who gets along with women as his friends and you need to accept that and trust that there is no ill intentions and he is genuinely just building friendships.\n\nShe literally sent this in a space of 6 minutes.\n\nMe: Sure, I'll put myself in your shoes. Visiting a man only when his wife isn't home. Constantly asking him for help with menial things around the house. I reached out to bury the hatchet. And then you spit out about i mustn't let my insecurities get in the way of someone's blatant disrespectful actions?? LOL! \nAnd again, I don't care who he is friends with. Whether its a penis or a vagina. I'm not jealous by nature, as hes had dinner with exes, we've had threesomes and we constantly comment on women that we see in public.\nBut when something makes me uncomfortable and I ask that the visits while I'm away stop, then I'm insecure? Thanks\n\nB: No OP. That's not what I am saying. I was trying to get you to understand that you have a loving and loyal husband and need to allow him to be friends with others. I did explain to you from my side why I did visit when you weren't there and still did say I will respect you boundaries moving forward but would really like to maintain our friendship\n\nMe: He can be friends with whoever the fuck he wants to. I didn't tell him to cut you off. I only asked that you not visit when I'm not here. That's it. If he ended the friendship, that was him.\nYour blatant disrespect now honestly killed any chances. I said to you that its not a good idea now while we work on things. And you decided that your fucking opinion mattered. \nIf I made a mistake, I would never put the blame on the other woman, blaming her insecurities and saying she must let her husband be friends with other women. \nShame on you\n\nB: I will give you time.😘\n\nMe: There's nothing to think about. You showed exactly who you are, your narcissistic need for attention led you to overstep. Whatever place you imagined you had in C's life doesn't exist. He even sees how disrespectful and unacceptable your behaviour was. All of us have lost every ounce of respect for you.\nEnjoy the life you've made for yourself.\n\nI then blocked her. My husband was appalled by her behaviour and said that it’s completely unacceptable. He did not text her to say that, but he did decide that cutting her off was the only option. He promised he would tell me if she texted him, and he hasn’t said anything, so I am trusting him. \n\nShe has moved out of the estate and is no longer part of our lives. I wish I could’ve given her a proper send off... a glitter bomb or raw fish down her car vents, but I was too preoccupied with work and my baby. \n\nWe are doing much better, and he sees how much his actions have hurt me. He is making more of an effort to make me feel better and happy and secure in our marriage.\n\nThanks for reading.",

      "selftext": "I can’t sleep after today and I just need to talk about this, I’m not sure who to tell. Gonna leave a lot out because I’m just here to vent and process.\n\nI’ve been divorced for 10 years. We’re all in our 30s and have a lot of kids between the 3 of us. My ex husband’s wife and I were neighbors and friends with each other (including our kids) before they got together, about 4 years into us being divorced, or 6 years ago. I’ve never been upset that they got together. However, things soured pretty bad between all of us 3 years ago when they got married. They wanted me to move to a different state, but I refused, and it got ugly. It got ugly between them and me, and then it got ugly between the two of them. They broke up a lot of times, there was a DV call against her, and so on.\n\nRecently they moved back to the area, and their relationship has stabilized a lot. I had an unexpected sit down talk with her today, where she shared a lot of her experience being married to him. Everything she’s shared are reasons I separated from him. He’s verbally and emotionally abusive. It brought it all flooding back. I’d hoped he had gotten better with time and therapy, and he has gotten a little better recently, but it was way worse with her earlier on than it ever was with me. I can’t not believe her - this is all the same shit he’d do with me. She said she thinks he’s a covert narcissist (for the uninitiated, it’s someone extremely self focussed with an intense victim complex, but they lack the malignant or overt narcissism). I can’t refute her claim, knowing what I know now about what that is. She also shed light on the DV call from 3 years ago. She explained that he was the aggressor and she was defending herself, closing his hand and face in the door because he was trying to go after her when she closed herself and their toddler in a room to get away during an argument. If this is true, I feel horrible. When he called the cops on her, he also called me and told me a different version of the story where he was scared for his safety, so I filed an order of protection for my kids against her, which was granted. Later on he recanted and told me that if I didn’t drop the order, he’d make my life a living hell legally. It was all very dramatic and intense and a little confusing. I eventually did drop it because my attorney said it would likely be removed, since my kids weren’t there when the event happened like their half brother was.\n\nThe thing I’m ruminating on is that I have a deeply repressed trauma of him SAing me at the end of our marriage, once. I can’t prove it happened, I’d have zero case if I wanted to bring one, but I confronted him a few years ago about it over the phone when the memory resurfaced, and he remembers it too, and he apologized. Neither of us knew it was r_pe at the time. We come from an extremely conservative background and were virgins when we married, so marital r_pe was a foreign concept.\n\nI wasn’t expecting to have to think about that today, though. I think that’s the main thing I needed to get off my chest. I haven’t told anyone besides a best friend or two over the years.\n\nThis is a long read so I’m not expecting anyone to read it all and I’m not looking for advice or validation or anything, maybe just a witness to all the weird drama of coparenting with a narcissistic person. so if you made it this far, thanks for reading. I don’t really know what’s next. I want to support her if she decides to leave him. If he is being emotionally abusive, which I know he can be, he’s kind of fucked now that we’re talking about it together. I’m also worried about my kids being exposed to the toxicity and have been for some time. Thankfully I have them for a majority of the time.",

It's usually around this time when people have their first experiences with dating and relationships. Later on, there were women throughout the years I was interested in, but they were all taken. I see couples everywhere, young and old. I had a younger coworker who met their boyfriend online and she got married to him at 19 - they were madly in love. She once told me that she'll be with him forever. She ended up moving 10 hours away to be with him, and many years later they're still together with kids. It makes me wish I could have experienced that kind of deep, intimate love.\n\nAnyway, it's given me a lot of grief on what I missed out on.

      "title": "Porn, Masturbation, & Sex Addiction",
      "selftext": "TW: child molestation\n\nMy (32F) husband (33M) has been watching porn since he was like 9 or 10 years old and has been cumming several times a day ever since. Unbeknownst to me, prior to the discovery, via daily sex and masturbation he was orgasming 4-6x/day. The 4 to 6 orgasms he was having includes the sex we were having 1 to 2x a day.\n\nHe used to chalk it up to being a sexual person with a high libido and I never realized how much he was masturbating because of how efficient he was with it. He would just get away for brief moments and be back 5 to 10 minutes later.\n\nEventually, in a hugely dramatic escalation, his masturbation addiction manifested in him molesting a young family member. It went from needing to orgasm 4 to 6 times a day, wild kinks, visiting BDSM clubs and “Fetlife” events (before we got together), perusing (but allegedly never purchasing services from) escort sites to… literally allowing his niece sit on his lap for 30 minutes to stimulate his erection while me (his wife) and her father (his brother) sat at at same fucking table.\n\nAfter I caught onto what was happening (saw the erection, plus his arousal “tells” in his eyes and voice), I freaked the fuck out and confronted him. He was so defensive at first that he refused to acknowledge what I saw but I didn’t have the patience for the minimizing, deflective, rationalizing bullshit and pressed him to admit what he was doing. That day was hell, and I didn’t necessarily react like my best self either. In the coming days, after very little sleep for both of us, and ungodly amount of tears, he admitted he knew while it was happening that it was wrong, that it was fucking egregious, that he didn’t understand why he did it, and that he needed some major interventions.\n\nBefore he owned his shit, we were on the brink of separation. He had fought really hard to salvage his reputation with his family in the immediate aftermath (so much so, that he threw me under the bus and painted our short separation as having resulted of menial complaints I’d had recently, and implying that my response was an overreaction). I had thrown my wedding ring at him, told him we were over, and found my own way back home (we were on a roadtrip visiting his family). When I found out he’d been minimizing what had happened to those he told, I told him that there was only a modicum of hope that we didn’t follow through with the divorce and it involved him getting his shit together.\n\nUnfortunately, we don’t believe that he would have realized how problematic his porn and masturbation habits were if he hadn’t hit rock bottom. He would have never have thought to call his habits an “addiction”. He was a fucking hair away from traumatizing a (thankfully unwitting) little girl, catching charges that fined the shit out of him or landed in prison, getting put on the sex offender registry, and collapsing his marriage.\n\nThe brazenness and steep escalation of his actions with his niece blindsided us to the point where we truly believe anything could have been possible under the right (wrong) circumstances. Neither of us had any idea that he even had a problem until this happened just about 1.5 months ago.\n\nThe silver lining is that he seems to be well on his way to beating this thing. An addiction that was literally looming in the shadows waiting to fuck up his life. If it wasn’t this it could have been anything else. Another impulsive escalation to visiting escorts that plumaged our bank accounts, infidelity, diseases, who knows.\n\nIt was probably the hardest thing he ever did, but he wrote up a full disclosure with full details of the event to his parents, his nieces parents, and his best friend. He cleared up the stories he was spinning when they were fighting to continue giving him the benefit of the doubt. He signed up for therapy even knowing that they would have to mandatorily report the incident to authorities.\n\nWe are still together, conditionally. I love him so fucking much. So much. And I deeply and sincerely want to honor our vows “through sickness and through health”. Even though this has all thoroughly fucked me up and I’ll likely be in therapy for the foreseeable future processing this and all the aftermath of the event, I’m choosing to give this a genuine try and see his issues and struggle for what it is. The result of a sickness.\n\nHe is putting in “the work”. He has bought a small bookshelf’s worth of books that he’s actually working through. He’s doing individual and group therapy through this program that specializes specifically in men’s sex addiction. He’s completely abstained from porn, and mostly abstained from masturbation. With me, he is being communicative, self-reflective, and compassionate while I do my own work in trying to pull myself out of the PTSD and depression this has rocked me with. I haven’t made it easy and he’s taking my (sometimes intense and honestly toxic) reactions to triggers as gracefully and empathetically as anyone possibly could.\n\nWe are now traversing a “new normal”, and for him it comes with changing the way he relates to his sexuality and his sexual health completely. This has also made me reconsider my own stance on some things. Even though I have no moral qualms with porn, masturbation, sex work, etc. I’ve just witnessed firsthand how gradual desensitization to more “extreme” content and how immediately reinforcing urges to masturbate and orgasm can lead to dangerously uninhibited impulse control. Looking back on it, there are always “signs” that he had little to no impulse control when he was aroused but we used to have a “free use” agreement that masked how sexually aggressive he got when he was horny. Without this happening I would have never seen the pattern.\n\nAdditionally, this experience has also given me a deeper sense of empathy for those struggling with addiction and has even held up a mirror to me regarding my own addictions (cigarettes, weed, food). Addictions hide things from you, allow you to lie to yourself about your true intentions, down play the significance of problematic behaviors, and can even reward pushing past reasonable boundaries so can you to keep getting your “fixes”. Then one day, fucking boom. You go too far, or health issues catch up to you, or you get discovered and your whole world comes crashing down.\n\nTo those struggling with addiction: I feel for you, I really do. I hope you have kinder, safer, calmer, and more fulfilled days ahead of you.",

I’ve had to take mirrors out of my house or cover them because it’s been so bad at points. \n\nYes, I’ve been to therapy, on and off since I was a small child and it hasn’t gotten better. Im literally disfigured, deformed. No amount of exercise, weight gain or loss, body recomp, or even surgery will correct it. No matter how skinny I’ve been I always look “big”. No matter how big I am it doesn’t balance out. I had a an incredibly large rib cage, my torso is mostly rib cage. It’s wide and also flared, on top of that I have small saggy tuberous breasts with big areolas. I’ve posted on Reddit in specific subreddits for people with similar bodies but I just get messages from fetishists. It’s like no matter what I do I can’t change my bone structure. I look odd. People will say I’m pretty in a unique way or along those lines but it’s not. It’s not conventionally attractive, all of my ex partners have never looked up women who look like me, they’re all normal looking and I’m so tired of the way I’m built. I wish I was normal. ",

      "selftext": "What am I supposed to do? My doctor told me my case is one in like 200,000 people. But two years ago roughly, I went to a doctor for help with anxiety. I was prescribed Cymbalta. Within a few days, I noticed a burning sensation in my brain and my genitals became numb. I also had emotional blunting. I took it for a few more weeks, but the problems persisted. My doctor told me to stop taking the medication.\n\nIt’s been almost two years now , and my genitals are completely numb. I no longer feel orgasms. I’ve met with a top urologist in the Netherlands and was diagnosed with PSSD. I’m so young, and I feel like this has ruined my life.\n\nI just needed help with anxiety. Now, I can literally pinch the tip of my penis as hard as I can and feel nothing. It doesn't hurt; I can't feel it at all. And before anyone says to just take Viagra, I do take Cialis. All it does is help with an erection. It does nothing for the complete loss of sexual pleasure. I no longer feel love or connection to anything. I cannot focus anymore. I cannot follow along with movies or books any longer since taking and stopping this medication. \n\nHow am I supposed to live with this? It’s like someone cut your privates off and told you to just live with it and be okay with it. I don’t think I wanna live like this forever. What I experience goes far beyond just sexual dysfunction. It’s like being a ghost in your own life. I’ve tried therapy, ketamine injections, a variety of diets, working out, vitamin and sex hormone checks. In the Netherlands I can apply for assisted death. I just cannot believe this happened to me.\n\nThe reality of this condition is so severe that a psychiatrist named Dr. David Healy has written about it in the context of Canada's assisted dying laws. He states that individuals with Post-SSRI Sexual Dysfunction are now applying for Medical Assistance in Dying (MAiD) because their condition is permanent and the distress is unbearable.",

For as long as I can remember I’v always thought people who have a high BMI are hot as hell. Now let me first clarify a few things: Now i’m not just talking people with a lil dad bod, or chubby thighs (although both are also cute) I  find people who are morbidly obese, even so large they cant move without aid extremely attractive. I also find it extremely hot when someone intentionally goes from skinny to very very fat. I love tight clothes, and seeing someone eat until the buttons on they’re clothes pop and the belly surges outwards is intoxicating to me. Now I’m not going out of my way to fetishize people who don’t wanna be fetishized, if your a large person but wanna lose weight or don’t personally like how you look then obviously I’m not gonna be weird and like, hit on you. I just really needed to get this off my chest because it is something I have honestly hidden my entire life out of shame. I don’t know why, but most people find it “weird” or “gross” when someone likes very big body’s. I just wanna be able to talk about my preferences and crushes without people judging me? I know this is a reasonably common fetish, and I apologize if this post has been made here a dozen times before but I just wanted to be able to speak freely about this for once. I’m totally open to answering any questions  people might have, no matter how weird they might be, just please be kind!",

I havent seen anyone else sweep, mop, do laundry, buy groceries, clean put the fridge, or even tidy up. Every day I come home from work everything looks exactly the same as I did when I left. Sometimes theres more dishes in the sink or some leftovers have been eaten, but nothing *productive* is ever done. We have 2 cats and im the only person that ever cleans the litter box. I live with my partber and he always talks about how unfair it is that I do all the work. THEN HELP? HELP CLEAN SOMETHING INSTEAD OF PLAYING ON YOUR COMPUTER 24/7.\n\nI work overtime most weeks. Sometimes im working 12+ hour days. Im on my feet constantly. The last thing I want to do is come home and do *more* work. Im in a community fan project with a group of friends and I havent been able to work on my contribution in weeks because im too busy staying up until 4am doing chores. Meanwhile, one roommate is goijg to drive 10+ hours to buy a new PC abd my oartner just joined a dnd campaign.\n\nGreat. Good for them. Must be nice to engage in hobbies instead of taking the drawers out of the fridge to clean all the dried up messes from the spoiled food they didn't help get rid of. Or scrubbing the shower so we dont get black mold. Or finally organizing all of *EVERYONE ELSE'S* clutter because im tired of my house looking like a hoarder home.\n\nWhen I was a kid, my mom would work a full time job and come home to a messy house and spend hours cleaning it. I know, we were ungrateful kids who knew we should have helped and only did the bare minimum so we could get back to our video games. I always assumed she was being dramatic when she complained or asked for help, but I guess this is my karma. I swore I was never going to turn into my parents when i moved out. I saw how miserable they both were, and still are. Staying in an unloving relationship where my mom does 95% of the work, silently killing herself because she stopped complaining. I know how she feels now. Id just be nice to come home every once in a while to the dishes washed or the trash taken out.\n\nAnd I can already read the comments. \"You're overreacting\", \"if youre not gonna talk to your roommates, stop complaining.\", \"just stop doing any chores and force them to do something themselves\". Im not looking for any advice or solutions. Im not even looking for sympathy. I dont know why im making this post but if a stranger on the internet made it this far, then thank you. I always rolled my eyes at the random vents on reddit but yeah... it helps. Thank you for listening to my incoherent ramble.",

      "selftext": "Just wanted to rant. I broke up with my ex more than a year ago and had a thing in between when he returned back home. I thought he changed, but never according to me; things happened in between; he suspected me of cheating when I waited for more than a year for him and decided to move on when he acted shit towards me. His friends were gossiping and saying I cheated. I called him; he never picked up, he texted two months later and said everything went down the drain because of me, because I couldn't move on from my first ex very fast. I contacted him when his father passed away and showed him empathy and cut him off after. I was cold, uncaring, and unconcerned when I was just thinking about him, haha. I have loved everyone wholeheartedly when I was with them, but it was never enough. I don't love him anymore; I'm sure of it lol. I texted him from my sister's account to know how he is. tbh even if he was not my first love, he was indeed my FIRST LOVE. being 8 years older, he wanted things which I couldn't give, I guess. According to him, I ran away and was unaccountable, selfish and narcissistic, and I'm questioning myself about where I went wrong. He completed his master's, got a good job, and is stable now and moving on, which I'm happy for tbh. He hates me, and it's ok; I took a stand for him, maybe not strong enough, and he thinks I never took a strong one. He really wanted it to be me, he said, maybe I'm not a good partner or child or daughter or anything; I'm a disappointment too, love sick. He will always have grudges against me lol, it's ok. I'm writing this while listening to About You, a song I secretly dedicated to him and never let anyone know. but I almost listened to this song thinking about him after a year; it is my favourite song. He moved on with his life, and I'm stuck at a place in the same cycle. Just wanted to let the thoughts out.",

I suppose I'm what you call a high-functioning alcoholic. Oopsy doops, I guess that saying that I won't end up like a bunch of other shitheads in my family isn't sufficient. Anyway, I did it, and I feel like death. I don't get what the point of being sober is right now. I'm still in a house that is filthy no matter how hard I clean, I'm still tired no matter how much sleep I get, the caseload at work still keeps piling on without ever stopping, and the disturbing headlines keep coming in, and I'm sober in the midst of it. I screamed into a pillow at one point, and that didn't muffle it nearly as much as I thought it would. Then I spent the next hour worried that the cops were going to come knocking on my door, so this is an interesting way to find out that I could be brutally murdered and my neighbors wouldn't do shit. So yeah, I'm sober right now. It fucking sucks. I guess there's a reason why I'm doing this to myself, though. I fully intended to smoke weed tonight and just kept putting it off. Progress, yay. I don't really feel like being here right now, this whole life thing seems like bullshit right now, so I guess it's good that I don't remember the code to my husband's gun safe. I don't really want advice, I probably won't read any comments on this. Just wanted to get it out there.",

      "selftext": "For the last month I've been going through all kinds of grief. My high school sweetheart cheated, told me she was now in a relationship with a women for the last month and it's been ongoing for the last 3 months. \n\nLeading up to this she was going through a major mental health crisis. It was her cousin's suicide anniversary and she started expressing feelings of suicide herself. I helped her through it as best as I could but her friends kept encouraging her to go out, drink, sing karaoke. Soon she started coming home at 7 am and sometimes not at all. We have 3 small children, 4, 5 and 7. For 12 days straight  I took care of them while they literally thought their mom was dead. She would cold shoulder me on the days she would come home then leave at 10:30 at night. \n\nIf that ain't ugly enough, it gets worse. For the last 15 years and specifically the last month she has been blaming me for all her emotions. She has been trying to break up with me then standing in front of the door and not letting me leave. She has made me feel like I'm not enough during our entire relationship. Eventually it got to the point where I told her I was going to withhold love from her, I was going to stop saying I love you, I was going to stop looking her in her eyes and I was going to only be a bit vulnerable with her. I told her it was up to her to foster a relationship of love by commiting to me. The longest she could go was 6 months before trying to kick me out again. Her list of reasons for wanting out always changed. By the end of every fight, she'd come back, apologize then try and have sex with me. She'd tell me \"please, love me now, my craziness sis over, I didn't mean it\". Id reluctantly cuddle her and assure her that I could get through this consistent abandonment. When things would come smoother if try to love better, id handcraft cards, tell her I love her, make videos for her, talk to her all night.\n\nIt gets even uglier. Currently, she has told everyone in her life and even convinced her therapist that she is the victim. That if I loved her correctly she would never need to cheat. That her heart was so desperate for love that anyone could of swooped her up.\n\nThe ugliest part. I moved 2 hours away from family and friends so she could secure her dream job and be 5 minutes away from her parents. I became a stay at home dad while working remotely. Both my parents were drug addicted and devasted my childhood, my grandma adopted me at 7 and saved my life, so I always vowed to take care of my children no matter what. Currently, she is at a work trip in a different city with her girlfriend. Weekly she goes on dates late a night for alcohol fueled sex with her new partner. During all this she will come home and try to have sex with me, at least 5 times she's told me she's not sure she wants to leave me fully, and that she'd like an open relationship. I've told her no, but the pain of not having her is killing me, so I routinely let he back in. Last night we cuddled, nearly kissed, she insisted on sex but I said no.\n\nFor now, I can't bare to abandon my children. They love me and I love them. So I have to stay home, watch my wife come home with hickies all over her body and take care of the children. I'm dying. I'm suicidal and I'm 90 percent certain I'm joining the army to get over this pain. But in reality, I just want her to miss me. I want to find a strong remote job so I can be close to my kids and afford a 200k home near by. That is my dream. \n\nThanks for listening to my rant. Feels good to put this into words and if you have any questions or insight, please let me know as I know I'm not a perfect person and perhaps caused some of this myself.",

      "selftext": "I have a graduate degree in a tech field but the people, environments, and daily activity made me deeply depressed. Stepped away from that to pursue a job related to my lifelong interests and hobbies, where I am very happy; this field literally breathes life into me and family tells me that I'm an entirely different person when I'm involved in these pursuits. \n\nI feel confident in saying that this industry is my life. I give it time, blood, scientific approach, literary review, and hands-on experimentation just for the enjoyment.\n\nI reconnected with old mentors to work on skills they taught me when I was just a teenager; worked really hard to get back to a competitive state. I spent lots of time and money on travel and fees to gain the certifications that would pass the HR sniff test and landed interviews pretty easily. \n\nEvery interview and went positively, passed performances requirements in testing, had great interactions with everyone involved. Talking to people with backgrounds similar to mine and exploring our mutual expertise has felt like chatting with old friends.\n\nEach experience was as if I was donning a tailored suit, and everyone talked to me as if I was already working there, giving me the rundown of what \"we\" would be doing and what help they'd need from me once I was one. \n\nI really got that sensation as if my life was about to fit together like a perfect movie script; felt like I was going to work doing the things I normally do for own enjoyment and be among \"my people.\" I could envision what a day was going to look like for the first time in my working life. But, none of it has come to fruition.\n\nIn most cases I've received positive notes and follow-up calls and have then been ghosted. A few times just ghosted, no response to contact. A few times I've been given the whole entrance process with talk of an offer on the way, then later told an offer wasn't coming. I've asked for feedback whenever I had the opportunity for post-contact but have only received it once. I've seen the listings for jobs I applied to get reposted after I was cut off... that stings. \n\nI don't really know what's happening. I feel like there's some mark denoting a bad fit on my forehead that I can't see, but is very clear to everyone else. I'm not giving up, just taking a break from packing up my stuff to express my thoughts. Time to put everything back in storage then camp out in another city to work on applications at close range. I will continue the effort.\n\nIt's getting hard to show up to events in my hobby after people in those spaces recommended me for positions or encouraged me to apply at places they know, then I didn't get the job; I feel ashamed to show up in the social spaces and have to face people who placed their confidence and/or endorsements on me after I didn't make it. I don't want to seem like a person that needed help, had it given, and then squandered it all. \n\nI keep finding excuses to skip on family visits during holidays because I don't want to face anyone who looks at my failure to get a foothold in this field and asks me why I'm not just making money doing what they do, join one of their companies, take this or that path, etc. I have younger siblings and cousins who are all doing well in their careers and education and when they come to me for advice or just to check up on me, I don't want to have to tell them that I've been out here doing \"nothing\" for years...\n\nI can't do owner/operator stuff and start my own business, as that's just not within in my ability or interest.\n\nIf I could just get some actionable feedback, I'd work so hard to improve for the next try. I'm tired, and I don't know what's going wrong, and I'm frustrated that I don't know because I don't know what to do. I make tweaks and changes with my approaches but it's just blind stumbling at this point.\n\nI can still envision what the success will look like but I can't help but wonder if I'm embracing delusions.\n\nIf what feels \"right\" isn't working out, maybe my perception of a good fit is all wonky.\n\nIf I can't fit in with \"my people,\" then maybe they aren't my people and maybe I just don't belong in this field like I think I do, and this industry isn't actually my life.",

      "title": "I HATE my friend's girlfriend.",
      "selftext": "I HATE my friend (42f)'s girlfriend, and I can't hide it from her anymore. My friend, \"Jane\" started dating this woman, well call her the roach, a little over a year ago. The woman had always had some serious reflags, but as time progressed it was clear she was awful.\n\nAt first, Jane was just always really busy with her new girlfriend and couldn't hang out. Jane would make plans to hang out with me, or come to my monthly game night, but then something would happen with the roach, and she would stand me up. Excuses would be stupid things like, the roach's chain came off her bicycle and now Jane has to help her put it on, so she can't hang out after all. The roach got distracted and Jane had to help her, the Roach's phone was dead and needed to be charged, etc. All of this made no sense why she couldn't hang out anymore.\n\nThe roach was homeless at the time Jane met her. Jane wanted to care for her so she had the roach move in with her. Not long after Jane was kicked out of the house. The excuse was always Jane's roommate's girlfriend was a jerk who had personal issues with the roach because she's a jerk. Then they moved into a different house, then it was the new roommates were horrible people who were abusive towards the roach. They went through a series of living situations, were they always were kicked out, and magically everyone was jerk who didn't respect the roach.\n\nJane stopped answering her phone when I called. She was always too busy dealing with various issues involving the roach. She stopped talking to me, but would occasionally text me.\n\nJane was actually a stable person. She had a career that paid the bills, and went to school part time studying for a 2nd career. She lived in a stable roommate situation. After the roach came Jane quit her job and dropped out of school, mostly so she could take care of the roach full-time.\n\nBy some bizarre turn events, Jane always is claiming that someone is hacking into her bank account and steeling her money. First it was an old roommate, then it was various friends of Jane, but personally, I think it's the roach. Jane is constantly changing her banking information.\n\nAfter about 8 months of almost never speaking to Jane, she asked if we could hang out. I was so happy to. I drove to her home and picked her up. Our hangout was pretty awful, Jane explained that she was sorry and had to go buy the roach cigarettes during our hangout. Jane asked for a ride to the convince store. Jane explained the roach only uses expensive, high-end cigarettes so Jane had to transfer money from her accounts to afford them. It took forever. Keep in mind this is the day before they were about to be evicted, again, and this was the highest priority. Jane explained that if the roach didn't have her cigs, then life at home was difficult so this was the top priority. After Jane dropped of the cigs, we were finally able to hang out a local park. Jane was talking and started acting like her usual self, when suddenly she turned white.\n\n\"She's here, that's my girlfriend\" she said, pointing at a blonde woman in the distance. Jane didn't look happy, she looked scared. The roach approached, and the proceeded to bitch Jane out. Jane apparently didn't deliver the cigs the way she wanted her too. She yelled at her, called her names. Jane just apologized and turned white. After she left Jane said she didn't feel well and needed to go home to try to smooth things over. I hated that woman so much. I just wanted to kick her ass and scream at her to leave Jane alone. The interaction was so awful, I couldn't help but feel disgust every time I saw a blonde woman for the next two months. This odd as I myself am a natural blonde woman. Just everyone reminded me of the roach.\n\nSince that day Jane and the roach have been homeless living on the street. Jane has been arrested and gone to jail for various neglectful reasons, like not returning rented property (she got busy with stuff and forgot too, etc).  The roach has also been to jail, for domestic violence against Jane. I tried to talk to Jane about her girlfriend. One evening her girlfriend got mad at her an attacked her. Jane came and visited me, and we talked. I told her kindly, but honestly I didn't think her girlfriend was good for her. Jane told me others had told her the same thing, but she didn't believe them. I told her the roach was abusive. She asked me for evidence. I pointed out that the roach has been isolating her from her friends and family. Whenever Jane has plans the roach suddenly \"needs her\" for some stupid task and Jane can't come. Jane then apologized for all the canceled plans and explained she's been really busy and she's sorry she isn't as reliable. She totally deflected from the roach's controlling behavior. I then pointed out that the Roach was literally arrested for domestic violence against her. Rather than a wake up call, Jane then jumped to asking how I knew this. I explained that when Jane went to jail I looked up the public records of incarceration and saw the roach's name there, and read the charges. Jane then changed the subject to how hard it was for her to find this information and wanted to know how I found it. No matter how obvious the evidence is, Jane is so deep in denial and doesn't want to admit how toxic this relationships is. \n\nJane has called and talked about verbal and physical abuse against from the roach. However, the next day she will test me all about how she is the happiest she has ever been, how much in love she is with her, and how she can hopes she can change her, etc. I hate this. Jane keeps saying when things get better she wants me and the roach to meet again and become good friends, and that once I get to know her, I will like her too. I don't want to get to know that thing. I hate her, and I have no desire to see any good in her. I hate that Jane is doing this to herself. I think she has a love addiction. I don't think that Jane realizes that this woman is bad former. She thinks she is just having bad luck. She is totally blind. She says she is in love. If this is what love is, I don't want anything to do with it. I don't care how interesting the roach is, she is harming my friend and I just can't get on board with it. \n\nThanks for letting me rant.\n\n  \nP.S. - Please note I am not asking for advice, please don't offer any. I understand the fact Jane's life is ruined, and there is nothing I can do about it. I just have to watch my dear friend self-destruct. I just needed to vent as I accept the sad reality of Jane's life and my friendship with her. Thanks again for listening. ",

      "selftext": "So this is kind of an odd story, but bare with me. So I was jogging at my local park and was about 100 yards behind this family. The family consisted of two adults who I assume were the parents and a child about 8 years old. One of the parents shoved the child to the ground on the grass just off the pavement. I was stunned and contemplated running over there to see if the child was okay or hurt. The child immediately got up (seemed to be okay and wasn't limping or hurt looking) and started walking away with his parents again. I was too far away to hear what was said or if the shove was meant to be \"playful\" or if it was serious, but either way, playful or not, you dont shove a child to the ground EVER. I feel guilty for not running faster to catch up with them, just to say to the child \"Hey, are you okay? Just saw you fall and wanted to make sure you were okay\". But as a stranger, I didnt want to seem weird and go up to them, even though I'm so confused as to why someone would do that to their kid. They were far ahead of me and already pretty much to their car by the time I got closer.\n\nI feel so guilty for not asking the boy or his parents what the shove was about. I dont know if it was a playful thing or not and that eats me up inside as I feel an obligation to protect people if I see something.",

      "title": "My relationship with my daughter has been destroyed and it is my fault.",
      "selftext": "I have never done this before, nor would I probably do this in any lifetime, but I have to get this off my chest. I am not the most tech-y person out there, I didn't even know about Reddit until yesterday when my granddaughter showed me some art she had made on there, and then I stumbled on this. This is as good a place as any to get this off my chest. I am not looking for forgiveness, nor empathy, nor the opposite. This is just to put it out in the void, and hopefully it makes life a little bit easier.\n\n  \nBack in the day, when my daughter was growing up, we were basically the stereotypical family. White, middle-class, family in the suburbs, dog in the backyard. My wife was a stay-at-home mom, I was the main breadwinner in the family, my older son was the jock of the family, while my daughter was the quiet, soft-spoken student amongst us. Like I said, completely stereotypical.\n\n  \nWhen there were teenagers, my relationship with my daughter became quite strained, due to my own fault. When she was 17,  she came out as gay and I, for lack of a better phrase, did not handle it well. I won't excuse my behavior because there is no excuse for it, but I tore our family apart for no reason over the span of a year until she turned 18 and moved out. The only reason I can give, is that I never had an exposure to this sort of thing, and I did not understand it, but even still that is no excuse and I deeply, deeply regret it. I was never physically violent or anything, but in retrospect it was quite a lot of emotional abuse, that again I am not proud of, to the point were I would do anything to be able to do it over and just accept her for who she was.\n\n  \nAfter she moved out, our relationships never got any better, even with the rest of my family. My son was about to graduate college at the time, and over the years we had anyway slowly drifted apart a bit. I gave him his space because as an adult he had his own life, and after this blowout he slowly tapered off our contact and the like, until it became the occasional call every month to check in around holidays and stuff. My daughter never forgave me, as she should not have, and cut off contact for years and years. Not a word about anything, nor any time. Holidays came and went, birthdays on both our ends came and went, and still nothing. In the beginning I had a very stubborn mindset, akin to Sour Grapes and just thought \"She is an adult now, and if this is what she wants, then so be it\" so I just dug my heels in and kept on going with life. Make no mistake, my wife kept up with our son and daughter, but they wanted nothing to do with me at all. It was not until my wife passed away were I finally realized the gravity of my mistakes. When she passed, I of course let my son and daughter know when the funeral was, and the only communication for the first time in years from her was, \"If you are there, I won't be.\" And that is when I the gravity of my mistake finally hit me. \n\n  \nStupidly, I did not believe it, so I told her i would not be there, but then appeared and tried to reconnect. It was a half-hearted attempt truth be told, and I was also in the midst of mourning my wife, and they, their mother, so it was not the right time or place. To put a long story short, it ended with me and her arguing furiously, my son angry at me for ruining the funeral, and I thought I had lost my daughter forever. A year later, my son also passed away in a car accident, and this time when I did not go the the funeral and left my daughter alone. It killed me inside to not be able to say goodbye to my son, but I knew that my daughter deserved it more then I did, so I just sat down with Jack Daniel and just drank through the pain of it all. \n\n  \nSurprisingly after this, our relationship took a turn upwards. It was several weeks after my son's funeral that she reached out to asking for a tentative meet-up. When I read it, my eyes nearly jumped out of their sockets,and my heart out of my chest. I was so overjoyed, so elated that I would have a chance to fix thing, to make it right, to be able to express how sorry I was. In the days leading up to it, I could barely sleep from anxiety of screwing it up. And of course in the hours and minute leading up to it, it only grew stronger. When she finally sat down across from me, I started to spill everything I had been meaning to say, but she cut me off and just laid out the facts. No, she had not forgiven me, not she probably never would, and no she had never wanted me back in her life. But she had been convinced by her wife to try to reconnect after the rest of her family passed away.\n\n  \nIt hurt quite a bit to hear that, and even then I knew it was not undeserved, but I resolved my self to do whatever I needed to to make it up. The only thing that hurt more was hearing everything I had missed over the years. I missed her Undergraduate, Graduate and Doctoral Graduation. I missed her giving birth to their son. I missed so many Christmas', Holidays, etc. SO many memories had passed by while I stubbornly dug my heels in even though everything was my own fault. And truth be told, in my zeal to compensate, I went way overboard. My daughter had strict boundaries that she enforced, and several times I went overboard and crossed them in some grand delusion that I was making things better. Of course, she did the smart thing and cut me off again. In retrospect I would have cut my past self off again as well. And again, it did not settle in until my daughter-in-law came to my home and just shouted and screamed at me for every terrible thing I had done, and demanded I leave them alone forever. And again, in the moment I knew I had screwed up and was certain it was permanent. \n\n  \nYou will notice a large trend of stubborn and bad decisions on my part. That persisted outside of just my relationships, into other parts of my life. In the following years, my life was not great. Since my wife had died, I had let my health go, and I was also not becoming any younger either. The house was of course empty, but it was the house I had raised my family in, so it fell to me to do the DIY upkeep. I as never any good with it, but the constant long-form projects kept me busy retirement with nothing else to do. Until one winter's morning, when it came to a screeching halt. You see, in the backyard, we have an external spout my wife used to water the garden with, and eventually the wall around it had cracked. It was always something small so I put it aside, until it grew bigger and bigger, and instead of of calling someone to deal with it, I went out in the middle of January with a bucket of sealant and tried to patch it myself. \n\n\n\nUnfortunately, I ended up slipping on some ice, and when I fell I hit my head against the spout against the house, knocking me out for a dangerously long time. My neighbor said that they found me about 6 hours later after the sun had set, in the snow, when their dog dragged them over to me. Of course I woke up in the hospital, and they did their standard stuff. I had a brain bleed as well as a fractured skull, which after 6 hours in the snow had led to some irreversible deficiencies that persist till now, but I was by no means a vegetable. I was still somewhat able to take care of myself, and physical therapy got me as close to old form as possible. Now, I did not tell my daughter about this, because why would I? She told me she does not want me in her life anymore, my daughter-in-law told me she did not want me anymore, my granddaughter was only 2 years old when I was cut off again so she would not remember me. I had nobody that would care at all. Inevitably though, I needed help, so I hired a live-in nurse who could help me with day-to-day activities and eventually life settled back to something normal. I was of course bored out of my mind as I was not able to do any more DIY stuff, and my overall health was horrific, so it was not a great normal, but it was a normal. \n\n  \nMy daughter did eventually find out. I never told her, nor tried to tell her, but she did find out. Since we share the same last name in the system, the hospital accidentally sent the bill to her instead of me, and when she saw the bill immediately came over to find out what happened. To be honest, I was expecting never to see or hear from her again, and I had come to almost accept it, as sad as that sounds. To the point were when she came through the door while we were eating breakfast, I assumed it was to drop off the bill and just leave, but I never could have imagined what happened after that. \n\n  \nI know I am a horrible person. Nobody needs to tell me anymore, I have already accepted that I will be burning in hell for all eternity. But I never thought I would get *another* chance to reconnect. I sincerely don't know why she decided to \"forgive\" me, because even I would not have forgiven myself, but after she found out about the accident we patched things up as best as we could. She claims she was anyway going to try again, but I can't make myself believe it after everything I have done. All I know is that outwardly we have reconnected as a family, but inwardly it isn't that cut and dry. I can sense, hear and feel the tension, anxiety and stress coming from her when I am around. I can sense the animosity and feel the passive-aggressiveness from my daughter-in-law. At this point, I am so scared to screw anything up, I feel trapped in my own mind, even though I have no right to complain. I don't want to get too close and push her away again, and I don't want to be too far away and push us back to were we were, but I also know that it would be better for her if I was not around entirely. I don't want to become too close to my granddaughter, in case I am cut off again, even as I so desperately want to. She would be old enough to remember me, so I can't become too close now. I don't dare to even try to soften the tensions, or befriend my daughter-in-law. I feel so trapped, so scared, so anxious, so afraid about what will happen every day, about whether I will be cut off again and go back to my sad life, even as I know that it would be better for everyone involved. And the worst part is, I deserve all this. I did this to myself. If I were in her shoes, I would not accept me back. \n\n  \nIts to the point were I am afraid to tell her anything beyond the surface level. We have talked many, many times, I have apologized many, many times, and I have gone above and beyond in trying to atone, but I can't make myself share with her anything that could drive her away. I recently got diagnosed with cancer, the same cancer which took my wife, and I didn't tell anyone because I was so scared of losing them. For weeks I dealt with my own mortality alone while waiting for the biopsy, and then for months I dealt with the treatment on my own, lying to them about going out for other things. My health is anyway failing, due to a perfect storm of cardiovascular issues, diabetes, and my head injury. But I can't tell them. I have to keep it secret. Its the only way not to drive them away, and the only way not to be a burden. I have already got my will written, and to be honest, I don't think I will be mourned very much, so in a way, death would be final release for me, especially since a quick, sudden end would be better than them knowing in advance. Not that I look forward to dying, but in a way it would be a fitting end, for my pathetic, worthless, wasted life.\n\n  \nAgain, I would never have imagined doing this. Even while writing this, I still am not sure why I am doing this. But here we are.",

(Important context, my parents are long divorced and i moved in with my mom when i was about 6 because my sister did.) So I 17f just had my birthday yesterday and I'm so upset about it. No one got me anything besides my aunt (who I barely talk to) and my dad. I didn't even get a birthday cake. My dad has been pretty broke lately due to some issues at work, but he still found a way to scrape together almost $200 to buy me a collectors edition video game pre-order that I've been trying to save for. I'm so grateful that I don't have to stress anymore over it. But I'm still pissed at my mom. She kept taking the money i was trying to save under the guise of \"essentials\". She didn't even get me anything. When I asked about it, she said she already bought me my presents (2 monster high dolls that she made me pay her back for because she forgot that she still needed to pay the bills) but how is that a gift if I had to pay her back? Anytime I work, she asks \"how much did WE make?\" It annoys me so much, and she spends all my money on fast food because she won't cook and won't clean so that I can cook. She complains about being broke but took in another cat last week even though we already have 30+ cats alone. She doesn't even work. she's on disability but she does doordash once in a while. But even when she doordashes, she makes me come because \"she gets lonely\". She'll schedule dashing without telling me, then get mad when I have homework that I have to do online. I don't have time for everything she wants out of me. I wake up at 5AM, drive myself to school, go to a secondary campus (I go to a trade school in the mornings) go to normal school, and I have to an online class and Osha online training outside of school. plus I'm the manager of my school's robotics club AND I work. I'm lucky to get home and find time to unwind before bed on school nights. I'm going insane and the impossibility of saving anything is wrecking me. When I got my first paycheck (I have direct deposit to my moms account because she made me) I wanted to treat my.self to McDonald's because I was excited that I had money I made myself. only for my mom to inform me that I had less than a dollar left because she went and bought groceries that she ALREADY had money for and bought my sister and her best friend McDonald's. I'm so exhausted and if it weren't for the trade school I go to, I'd just move in with him. He lives too far for me to keep attending if I leave.\nTldr:I got nothing for my birthday and my mom keeps stealing my money",

My friend was very attracted to them and felt like he could talk to them about anything. W didn’t feel the same, but decided to become FWB with him so they wouldn’t feel “empty”. They were friends for months, but W blocked my friend for being annoying, which destroyed him. I tried to be there for him during this time. My friend would vent about this every day and always put W on a pedestal, calling them an “angel” and a “gift from God”. I’d always remind him that this person used him, and that he didn’t need them and his worth is not defined by this person.\n\nRecently though, my friend told me some new information. He said this person has killed someone (supposedly because they were going to be killed if they didn’t, so I GUESS that’s understandable if it’s true, though disturbing nonetheless), doxxed someone, is a necrophiliac, and made one of their friends send voice messages of themselves crying so they could jerk off to them. My friend knew about all of this during the course of the friendship, since the person told them, and was still head over heels for them just because they were physically attractive, had similar interests, and let him tell them anything.\n\nI get that you cannot control who you’re attracted to, and I’m not upset at him for still feeling some level of attachment to the person because I know he’s terribly lonely and they had nice moments together.

It’s one thing to feel some attachment and care about someone, but still recognize that they did bad things, but it’s another thing to make excuses, brush off what they’ve done to people, and call them an “angel” because they’re hot.\n\nIt’s not even like he stayed friends out of fear or guilt or something. It’s not like he doesn’t believe they did those things. He knew for a while. It’s like he just didn’t care, and if they never blocked him, he would have stayed friends. As long as they were attractive and gave him attention, that’s all that mattered, even if they hurt others. \n\nPlease tell me I’m not crazy for being disgusted and angry. Thanks for reading.",

Other than my balls, I’m totally flat there as though I have a vagina. \n\nIt’s caused me a bit of self-consciousness and lack of confidence as of late so I decided to see if there was anything I can do about it. There are some surgeries but they’re really iffy and not that great and my penis itself is rather small so they would only be minimally effective.\n\nSo, enter me looking up penis bulge enhancements. I easily found FTM prosthetic penises. They assume a flat surface and that is perfect for me. I bought a cheap one to try it out. It has changed my life. Whether it’s swinging or neatly tucked in my underwear, it’s doing work on my mental self-image. I recognize it’s not real, but the way it makes me feel is real. \n\nI know it probably seems ridiculous but I feel like I have a “manhood” now and the whole thing has been very gender affirming. ",

Anyways when i got pregnant he told me to abort the baby as he and i were not ready to be parents and he wanted nothing to do with the kid. I myself knew i was in a tough situation since my own family is pretty strict and have told me a million times to never wreck the family name by having a child before marriage (i also know of some of my aunts and older cousins having an abortion since they got pregnant before marriage) on top of that i am barely working or making money so i knew i couldn't give the child the quality of life they deserve so i decided to have an abortion with just my boyfriend and my best friend knowing. The thing is i regret it now especially not telling anyone else even though i felt like it was hard to trust anyone in my family. It has been 3ish months and im really sad and regret it, what if i told my family and they ended up being supportive. Also the main reason for my decision was not because of my boyfriend or my family but because i feared i would not be able to provide my child to the full extent it deserves at the moment as i always wondered why on earth my parents had me when they clearly were not ready for a child and i struggled alone for a lot of my childhood, but on the other hand what if God wanted me to have this child and i did something totally wrong. What if i would have been a good mother right now despite my struggles because I have always wanted a family and to be a mom what if. fucked up my chance.....i need some advice on how to get through this?

Like thinking about her in terms of feelings i have and cannot deny is somewhat uncomfortable, she didn't do anything, she's still the sweetest and the best person ever, but i randomly started feeling some kind of awkwardness. It's not the awkwardness you hear about when someone is talking about their crush, it's really unpleasant, I can't explain it. Like there's something about her being so amazing and sweet and perfect that makes me sick.\n\nI met a guy some time ago and we were in a very short relationship that failed immediately, but I don't feel like it's its fault. I don't know when or how it started, but i think this oddity started developing before him. Any feelings for her were shoved under the rug never to be seen again when I got in the relationship, but now that I'm single again i still feel great amounts of love for her. And it makes me feel somewhat uneasy.\n\nI cannot find the root of this feeling. Maybe it had something to do with having a relationship with that guy, maybe it's some sort of self hatred for catching feelings towards someone so important but there's nothing she did that could cause me to feel like this. Maybe it actually started after the failed relationship and it's some sort of trauma response for thinking about getting close to anyone again or getting close to someone else. Which would make a lot of sense but I can't see why thinking about getting closer to someone who's been so precious to me for a longer time would make me uncomfortable just because of some guy (that i still like as a friend and i'm friends with ‼️ so it's not even about being traumatized because of him). Maybe I'll know I 100% got over the breakup when i stop feeling like this about other potential relationships.\n\nOther than just being uncomfortable, it's very distressing for me to feel that way towards the best woman in the world. I love everything about her and it makes me feel even worse to think about how weird I feel towards someone I deeply care about and dreamed of building a relationship with.\n\nIs this normal? Is getting basically disgusted by something about having a crush or my crush herself a normal process? Why would that even happen for no reason? I don't really need advice because I believe it will pass eventually but I want to know if it has a possible explanation that I'm missing.",

Thug girl? I don't know) the point is that they had convinced her that Melissa had slept with her boyfriend and as expected, Camila and her friends waited for Melissa outside the school, I won't go into details but Melissa needed many surgeries and the last thing What I found out is that several paramedics had to take her to the ambulance because her legs didn't respond.\n\nI never knew what happened, I didn't know if Camila had legal consequences, I didn't know if Melissa is okay today or had permanent damage, I tried to speak in favor of Melissa, but everyone was so convinced that she deserved it that they only called me \"dragged\" which was the way they said \"simp\" in my neighborhood in those years.\n\nThe only thing I knew was that I knew Melissa firsthand, she was very nice, yes, maybe she liked the attention, but she would never get into a relationship and to this day, that story still weighs on me.\n\nTL/DR: The popular girl at school was humiliated, beaten and ridiculed in front of everyone, for something she didn't do, I saw it all, I knew of her innocence but no one believed me, I couldn't do anything, I knew her and I liked her, I hope she is fine today",

After staying in the hospital for weeks I still couldn't open my mouth and had to disinfect my mouth each time I ate even though it was liquid food, to make it worse the ones involved in what happened took their chance while I was still confused to manipulate me into not sueing, it took me over 5-6 months to go back to school and the doctor said it would take 2 years for my jaw to fully heal and that then I could have my two missing teeth implanted. Only my family kept me company during that time, but I isolated myself most the time and ended up making myself even worse mentally. When I went back to school i thought I was immune to trauma, but when i sat down and saw that kid walk past me I could not help but tremble abit and my mind went blank for afew seconds before I snapped back to my senses. I am sorry if this is long, I tried my best to shorten my story but I really not just wanted but NEEDED to vent about what happened to me. I want to cry while i am writing this but ever since i cried in the hospital that day i struggled to cry again and i really cant handle keeping this to myself anymore. (A short resume of the injuries; under my chin was open, my entire jaw was practically destroyed with pieces even sticking out and cutting me, my lip was cut open, there were many cuts inside my mouth, damaged TMJ which I still hear clicking from when I open my mouth, and possibly more that I cant think of at the moment.) If anyone wants any more details in specific i wouldn't mind talking about it.(infact I really wanna talk about it)",

For whatever reason someone really did not believe that it was a rumor. They got a lot of upvotes for saying \"It's not a rumor\"  and became combative with me then started making fun of Americans. They refused the evidence I linked them because it was an American source (the official Hoover Dam article posted by the US government). And bullied a guy and accused him of being American for agreeing that there are no bodies in the dam.\n\nI don't know why stating a historical fact was so controversial and why so many people agreed that the rumor is true despite evidence that it's not true. The way the concrete was delivered and set made it impossible to bury someone in it. Yet people want to be assholes to me over it. ",

Post contains moderate swearing as it was an internal monologue being typed out lol. I've been putting off doing this food shop at first until my mum came home from her partners (she kept staying extra days due to being ill) and now I'm putting it off because I can't figure out what to buy. I will also show my partner this post after posting for support I just want to get it off my chest and share these thoughts to a supportive community. Also I don't post often, first time posting here I think and am a bit self conscious lmao but here goes. Note: Typing this out helps.\n\nMy post:\n\nI am hungry, want to hurt myself and can’t figure out this stupid fucking food shop. Every time I try, I get it wrong. It’s one simple thing and I just can’t do it, I don’t know why. I just feel so isolated and alone. I can’t deal with it. I feel starved of physical touch and just sick, without being sick. I don’t know what the fuck is wrong or how to deal with it and just feel guilt. This food shop is hanging over me like a deadline that I just keep trying to push off because I don’t know how to deal with it. I don’t know what to pick, how much to spend, how long to plan for. Nothing is decided, everything is up in the air and I can’t cope. Oh and now I put my foot in the bin, just great. Ugh, I just want to scream into the void and let it all out. All this frustration and fear and anger and hurt and pain and confusion and yeet this food shop into the fricking sun.\n\nI just typed out my disclaimer and context without taking my foot out of the bin as my brain can't process that right now, that's an in a minute problem. Typing this post has distracted me and made me stop shaking and helped me organise my thoughts at least. I'm just so hungry and tired and confused. Why is this so hard. Somedays I don't want to eat, others 1 meal is a success, others I binge, I'm planning to talk to my mental health nurse about this. My body feels wrong and I know I'm eating wrong. At least I've taken my foot out the bin and cleaned it now and moved the bin further away form my bed, lol. I just, don't know what to do.\n\nThat's what I am. Confused, hungry and lost. Maybe this post or just getting this off my chest will help me find my way. Best wishes to you all and thank you if you got this far. <3",

The next fucking day after I got it back on August 17th I came out to see that all 4 windows and my rear glass were shattered. The thieves took nothing, my guess is that they were looking for the wheel lock key, which I obviously didn't leave in my car since I'm not an idiot. Started parking my car with nothing in it but my dashcam, leaving the glovebox and center console open, and folding the rear seats down.\n\nNothing happened for a little while and all was good.\n\nThen, on September 15th, I walked out to see my car was gone. Checked the location of the AirTag I had hidden in it. The thing was stolen. Long story short, I was able to recover the car with minimal damage. I had enough. It was time to fucking move. Moved in with my girlfriend who lives in an entirely different neighborhood.\n\nCame out to my car today and some motherfucker cracked the front passenger window and broke the rear one. Stole the dashcam. I've parked in her neighborhood leaving all sorts of shit in my car for years and never had an issue until now. The only thing that gives me some solace is the fact that this specific incident could have happened regardless of what car I own, contrary to the other 3 incidents.\n\nA fucking generational run. If these things happened over the span of 5 years it would have been crazy, let alone 2 months. I'm at a loss, man. This shit is driving me insane. I can't attend a friends wedding now because of the amount of money I've spent dealing with this bullshit.\n\nTo answer some things that every person I've told this to has mentioned:\n- I live in Philadelphia. Old neighborhood was Fishtown, new neighborhood is Grad Hospital. I have to live in the city because of my job and I don't want to fucking move again but maybe I have no choice.\n- I drive a 2019 Honda Accord 2.0T Touring. It's an amazing car, especially if you're a car guy that knows cars. But it's not an *obviously* nice car. There's a GLC that regularly parks in my (Now old) neighborhood along with an F80 M3.\n- For some reason, new-ish Hondas and Toyotas have been targeted for wheels recently. Don't know why, but it's a thing.\n- The police haven't done and aren't going to do a god damn thing.\n\nThis shit just makes my blood boil. Why do motherfucker have to do shit like this. That is all.",

      "selftext": "That's it, really. Let me specify its not physical abuse, but it is emotional and financial. Not even in an obvious way; four people had to tell me it was abuse and even then I still didn't buy it until my therapist confirmed it. It still doesn't feel right, like somehow I misconstrued everything, but I trust my therapist. She has no reason to lie. Feelings lie, facts don't. The trained professional identified the abuse, I'm going to believe her.\n\nI expected to have anger, rage even. That would make this easier i think. Instead, I'm just sad and resigned. I try to be logical in my decisions and logic dictates that if you are in an abusive relationship, you leave as soon as you can. It would be illogical to stay in the situation.\n\nIt would be easier if I could truly see it, I guess. He doesnt hit me or call me names. I'm the one who makes more money. So how can it be abuse?\n\nBecause he knows his actions cause me severe anxiety. He knows that when he only works one or two days a week it makes me feel unsafe and that I will swoop in with my savings to keep us in our apartment and feel incredible resentmet towards him because of it. He knows that saying he'll do something and then coming up with any excuse he can to get out of it lets me down and disappoints me. He knows that I literally count on him being unreliable, that im more surprised when he follows through than when he doesn't.  I know he knows all these things, I've said it a million times. And he keeps doing it. \n\nThat is the abuse. That's where it is. In the thousand let downs, the million lies, the time after time after time ive cried myself to sleep from disappointment, the anxiety so constant ive had 24/7 heartburn for months now that is DIRECTLY caused by his actions, my nonexistent savings from picking up his slack.\n\nHes not awful all the time. Sometimes I like him a lot. Hes so smart and funny and charming. Hes witty. He does little things for me like bring me my favorite cookies or get my tires changed for me (but of course, I paid for it.). He accidentally broke my favorite cup, tried to fix it, then bought me a replacement when he couldn't. \n\nIts not enough for me anymore. And that makes me more sad than angry because I really do love that fucker. I dont want to break up, but I dont want to live in this feeling anymore, either. I only have shitty choices; stay with the abuser or leave and break my heart.\n\nI'm gonna do it this week or next. I have a rule in place for myself that will trigger the conversation. I've already worked out my budget. I worked with my veterinarian to make sure my cats paperwork is only in my name as are all their bills so if he tries to take them, I have the legal documents to show by property law they belong to me. They aren't property, theyre my babies but that's neither here nor there. He cant take them. I can just have his name removed from the lease.\n\nI know this is the right thing. The situation is simple, but not easy. I really wish I was angry. Instead I'm just really fucking sad. Idk that this part is talked about enough, this horrible sadness that there's no fixing it, that you've done everything you can, and this is still the shitty fucking choice you're left with. I hear about the anger and clarity, but not this part. Maybe its just me.\n\nThanks for being here, I guess. And before you jump into the comments about how this is \"my fault\" for \"enabling the behavior\": I know. May you never be where I am. Try working on your empathy for victims ✌️",

I don't know how to manage stress well. My husband works but it's not a full time job I work full time at a salon as a receptionist but everything is thrown at me and I only make 16 a hour and constantly never get out on time because stylists take late colors and I have to stay with them so by the end of the work week I'm already past 40 hours and I don't get overtime. I asked my boss about it once and she was just like oh no one ever told me I had to do that.... We ultimately made the decision to go back to my parents because there were two weeks in a row that we paid the bills that needed to be paid but we didn't have anything left over for groceries.... I feel like even tho were at home with my parents and we may not have that big rent bill over our heads were still paying my parents a lil something to help them out... But I'm the one who is still doing all the grocery shopping with my own money and paying the health insurance every month for us. I live pay check to paycheck and I just feel like I still can't catch up and build my account.... 3 months ago I was at my Drs appointment and they decided to do a EKG after listening to my heart. I guess I have sinus techicardia and I'm still in it I know it's from all the stress at work and the stress I dealt with with my husband but it's not like I can just quit my job since it affects my health this much I've tried apply for something different but I've had 0 luck I just feel so down and lonely.

His cadence, smile, humor, face, almost everything about him I cherish to the point I can’t imagine we’re not meant to be connected. For this reason, It’s impossible for me to imagine any life without him and therefore I can’t keep going if he’s not apart of it. He’s chosen not to block me so he sees my calls and messages but chooses not to respond. On my birthday a week and a half ago I reached out to his mother, this prompted him to reach out saying, “I don’t have time to talk right now, but I wanted to wish u a happy birthday. We’ll address everything else later.” I say thank you but a week goes by I try to message him I get no response.. I start spiraling texting all these things\nAnyway I even tried to invite him to meet me at my job and I’d buy us lunch totally out of character for me to be thisobsessive but the connection I feel to him is unrelenting in every fiber of my being. It’s like déjà vu of a best friend before you know them but it’s meant to be. This brought me here. On the brink of buying helium and ending it all. Crying in nyc public uncontrollably. I can’t.

And trying to manipulate my kids. I also found out he’s been spreading some major lies and withholding thousands of dollars from me. Thanks to everyone’s points here, I’ve somewhat gotten ahead of him. I’ve thankfully already been approved for public housing, we’re on a waitlist now. Unfortunately legal aid hasn’t been help in filing for custody, they’re all full but I did find a lawyer willing to help at a discounted rate due to a referral, I just have to come up with 1000 for a retainer fee. \n\nSo things are somewhat looking up, and once I get the funds for the lawyer I’ll feel a lot better. Once again, thank you everyone for the advice, it’s been a major help!",

Some drivers are too slick and manage to shake me, and honestly, good on them for noticing they have a tail.\n\nLike last Friday, I trailed a maroon Nissan Rogue that led me to some random little office park. They went to the back parking area and I stayed in the front. Along the strip mall amongst the cell phone store, the family clinic and insurance agent was a taqueria I’d never noticed before. Nothing fancy, but those enchiladas? Absolutely worth the detour.\n\nI know it sounds a little odd, but honestly? To me, it’s harmless.

He’s been talking to these AI characters for months, and yeah… all of them look super feminine.\n\nI just don’t know how to take it. He spends hours on it, sometimes late at night, saying stuff he never says to me. I didn’t even realize people could get *that* close to an AI.\n\nI’m not mad about what those characters look like, it’s just… I feel weirdly replaced. Like he’d rather talk to them than me.\n\nDoes this even count as emotional cheating? Or am I overthinking everything? I feel confused and honestly kinda heartbroken.\n\nHas anyone ever dealt with something like this?",

I thought he was cool and wanted to get to know him better. I took out my 3DS intentionally to prompt an interaction and it worked. We battled my Pokemon X team against is OmegaRuby team. \n\nWe would see each other less often that semester because I dropped my morning class and no longer boarded the bus at the same time as him. The next time he saw me, he asked me if I wanted to hang out and I said \"sure\" because I wanted more people to game with.\n\nIt only occurred to me after he had already left that I was just asked out. \n\nFast forward to now and he's my absolute best friend and I love him and I couldn't ask for a better partner.

      "selftext": "Hi, I'm a 20 years old female and as a matter of fact (pretty important tho), i have a brother (18 years old) and my parents are both still alive. We come from  a certain culture and background that I won't name cause I dont want a whole groupe of people to be misunderstood around this story; that said, let's dive in, bear with me, there is a lot of informations; also sorry, eng isn't my first language.\n\nWhen I was little, i used to play a lot with my father's phone, things like \"temple run\" or \"subway surfer\", but sometimes (i don't know why) i'll just be scrolling in his photos. When I was around 8 to 10 years old (i dont recall precisely) i came accross a photo that a child like me should have never seen, it was a photo of a \"female's genital parts\". I remember being so afraid and shaken at that moment that i stopped touching his phone or being near it.\n  At that time, my father was reading and subscribing at  a lot of online journals, so I thought that the picture had downloaded itself without him knowing as it alredy happened before.\n\nAfter that, i started to have some serious doubts about him but they eventually faded away as life was going on. Today, my parents are still married but he is not with us as my mother, my brother and I are in another part of the world for our studies and my father is still in our home town. Not long ago, he came to see us during the holidays, at that time, him and my mother were pretty cold but nothing more or less than usual, they've always been like that (at some point i even wondered how they managed to get married in the firtst place). His stay was okay and he did return after the holidays, but if before, my mother and him talked a little, it reached some point were they didn't exchange a word for several months, and we're talking about 3 to 4 month. I found it odd but didn't put my mouth in it since it's their mariage.\n  2 weeks ago, my brother called me asking me who was the person (m) with my mother. Earlier that day, I did see a (m) in our house with my mother, they were having a chat in the garden (weird, but didn't make a big deal out of it). So I told my brother that there was a (m) in the house when I came back for school but didn't really thought about it, he then told me that she had posted something weird on her snap. I didn' have her on the app so he did a screen recording and sent me the video : we could clearly see her holding hands with a (m) near a lake, not the conventionnal hand holding but intertwinded fingers, at some point he was even kissing her hand! To be honnest i didn't know how to react as I knew she wasn't someone like that, but my brother was already talking about cheating. We agreed to keep that between us until we find out what was really happening.\n  Well I did find out not long ago. It was a colleague of hers that proposed to take her to the lake as it was their day off and she voiced that she wanted to see that lake maybe 2 days prior to that. As for the hands and the kiss, she stated that she didn't really mind and that was nothing. I freaked out and told her that this way of holding hands isn't something you do with someone you aren't close with as it could lead to misunderstandings (obviously) and the fact that she did let him kiss her hand was even worse. She argued, saying that it was nothing but I couldn't let her stuck at this idea as i know that my brother is my father's spy (father told him to keep a close eye on my mother) and my father is kind of waiting on any kind of proofs that my mother is cheating, even if it's not true just to make himself look good on the other hand. She finally understood or so i hope.\n  \nThat's when I learned that my father was cheating on her since a long time (it was obvious but guess i didn't want to admit it). In fact, my brother discovered that he was flirting and who knows more withaa gal (F) that we met during one of our travels , he told him to end it which he did but you never know. My mother also told me that he would pay the taxi for gals (F) to go at OUR house and do the deed in THEIR bed shamelessly and all the neighborhood knows about it. Also, he would sleep with the gals (F) his mother (my grand mother) pay to clean her house an cook. Oh and he also did sleep with a gal (F) my aunt was taking care of, we have photos of their conversations which i've seen (they were so disgusting i want to cry), he was and is  paying EVERYTHING for her while we are struggling out here (he said he would support us but maybe that chik is more important). My mother did send the proofs to his mother and his sister since they didn't believed her, and since that they've gone silent, even his brother confirmed the stories since he's seen them with his own eyes. When the story blown out, the gal (F) who was under the care of my aunt changed her name and profile picture on facebook (that won't stop me from finding her tho), my father  is apparently unapologetic (normal since he thinks that it's a RIGHT for a (m) to go outside). I'm DISGUSTED and it isn't getting better as my brother is starting to think that our father's behavior is normal.\n\nThe problem is that my mother NEVER talked about that with us, and from an external POV, she is the  bad one,  now that i know maybe 1/4 of the story i understand her even better but my brother even if he knows that my fathet did cheat would never understand this mess if she doesn't explain that herself and could end up (if not already) being 100% sure that his mom cheats, a male cheating is OK but a female  it's a NO (even tho both aren't okay), and surely that toxique masculinity stuff.\n  Apparently 2 of her siblings already know and one of them used to call him every single day, but I did see that it's been months since she did, she also stopped to talk about him as usually.\n\nI encouraged my mother to talk with my brother, to talk with him face to face so he can understand everything and see that the ideas he has aren't the good ones and that she has been suffering all these years without saying anything, he's seen her suffer so much already. Also, in any case, my father could maybe reflect on himself or... I don't know. I don't understand why they aren't divorced yet.\n\nI'm so angry and disgusted that I want to cry my eyes out, that (M) was my hero, the one who couldn't do ANYTHING wrong, seing that he has such low standing and even lower esteem for female pain me so much. He's been calling me and sending me messages as usual but I can't get myself to answer as if there's nothing wrong, ... I just can't.",

Tried to make me calm down, I tried to hold back my tears, which made me feel even worse and at some point I just started to choke.\nBut the final touch to the whole situation was a phrase from his father: “Do you know how many people like you have sat down with us on the road? Who have ‘unsolvable problems’”\nI just wanted to get up and leave.\n\nIn the last post, I wrote that I had good relationships with everyone, but I was very much mistaken.

Now, I'm going to try and get a full-time job next year, which is fine, normal, but my mum doesn't just want me to get a full-time job. She also recommends I get a part-time evening/night job doing food delivery or something for some extra cash.  I can't help but feel like it would be too much to do. A full-time job is already depressing enough of an idea, but working nights too? \n\nNot to mention, I have to do all the household chores. My mum doesn't do much, sometimes she does something, but like one thing once a week maybe, which is usually her clothes washing. I have to do EVERYTHING \n\nMost of the time I'm cleaning up after her honestly. When the bin is full and she leaves rubbish on the kitchen counter, or when she leaves spillages on the counter, or scrapes off her burnt toast over the sink getting crumbs everywhere. I have a feeling that's not going to change when I get my job(s). \n\nAnd I can't just talk to her, she will get mad as hell. I already did a few times. Once, when I was 13, I told her exactly what I'm saying here, and she used her sexual assault when she was 20 as an excuse? Went into detail and everything. Like that fucking sucks but she brought it up because I said I was doing pretty much everything in the house and I said I wanted her to not leave to leave her plate full of food on the side and actually scrape it off in the bin\n\nI'm already tired enough from college, I drink two cheap rip-off Monster Energys a day, not exactly healthy but it's what I have to do. because I'm always so tired for some reason but I guess it will be fine, I'll just have to adapt I suppose. \n\n",

      "selftext": "the last thing i thought i might do is writing on reddit but i guess i found no one to listen to me. enflish is not my first language so im srry if u found some mistakes i just wanna explain my feelings no matter how. so on OCT 2023 i met the love of my life our love was just like it came out of a romantic movie it was mostly a long term relationship but it was EVERYTHING for me. to make it easier to explain im gonna start saying that im from a religious family that deosnt accept the romantic relationships unless its serious and gonna end up with marriage which means the 'teenage' love life is not acceptable. not just for my family its in my religion anyways so anyone who doesnt follow this rule is seen as a Slut,bitch a girl whos gonna end up in hell. and so my parents doesnt want that. so when my mom found out about my bf she took my phone and went through it and simply blocked him and told me how am precious to her she didnt want to be strict as i was 16 and gave me my phone back the next day but told me to NEVER talk to him again she doesnt want guys to have fun playing with me. i didnt listen to her and added him again and hidded the chat. 5 months later she found that im still talking to him but now it became worse she found nudes. to be clear he didnt ask me to AT ALL he was so respectfull and took care of me knowing am still young . when she saw my nudes she went crazy and slapped me. ( btw when i was the age of 11-15 i was talking to guys and she kept on telling me to stoopp and i never listened to her) and now it was like hell nah thats enough she hit me hard with my laptop charger and pulled me with my hair to an empty room that time it was like a storage room and gave me my planket and locked the door and went through my phone and deleted my acc and took it and ever since i didnt see it again now i mostly use my laptop and ipad anyways she left me there for around 4 hours no AC crying and i was hella THISRTY at the dawn she opened the door saying there is no human can sleep in here go to ur room but her face was BLACK. i slept crying and when i woke up she got a big box and told me to put all my beaty stuff in it. she had an idea that by having this bf i made my self as a married woman while am a teen so took all stuff that might made me act older. to speed things up i went back to him from my laptop, to be clear he told me that its fine if we left each other until this drama ends up but i wanted him. by that time he took care of me and acted like my father,friend,therapist,brother and doctor before being a bf the whole time he listened to me while no one did supported me when i lost everything and kept me happy inside a tornado without pushing on me or asking something in return. you know when u find no one by your side so u cant imagine leaving the one andonly thing ur attached to in this life he supported me in studying,relationships,life so basically i couldnt just leave my angel and guess what happened then got caught again and this time my mom saw way worse and she choked me then literally fainted i was taking my last breath can u imagine what does it mean to be choked by your mom i wanted to die and then she told me i didnt was to kill just bcz i care of the future of ur sisters. i dont want u guys to see her as a monster cuz she changed alot and started to take care of me more thinking that i didnt look for love unless im in need of it but after what? after i lost my parents trust do u know what does that mean?? the first thing that comes to their mind is the worse always and i hate that as i love them but the fact that i lost their trust made lots and lots of fights between us which made me day by day going further and further. after that my bf went back to his god and promissed me to get married but he wants it pure as much as he can. so he asked for my father number and told me once he get graduated the first thing hes gonna do is knocking our door to ask for marriage.\n\nand instead of stop talking to guys and focusing on getting everything back i made LOTS of friendship relation ships with guys. which also not allowed and im talking about +40 not all of them are deep relationships but still ykwim in the other hand my bf stoped talking to girls and i did the opposite. now i feel like i hate my self like hes doing all of those stuff for us and i keep on ruining my life. and now guess what i met a friend and tbh he told me that he has feeling for me but we r not together we r just in that weird situationship anyways we r together from like a year and we got ATTACHED like we talk 24/7 for a whole year the thing is not here the thing is that hes so toxic and treating me soo baddd idk if my bf was way good to be true or this friend is a bad one. to be certain this friend is kinda up and down like sometimes i miss him literally if we didnt talk for an hour and sometimes i fucking hate him and like i wanna end everything. he talks about him self soooo much and hes like telling me to worship him or something in addition of that he keeps on telling me that hes 'sadistic' and talks about sex alot, i have no problem in that but dont talk to me like u want to do those thoughts on me spacially that he know that i love my bf and he also knows that we r not together anymore, he disrespect me and doesnt respect my feeling at all like yesterday there was a random guy tried to flirt with me and i simply said no and went and js told my friend and yk on these weird situationships when he gets jealous so he was yelling at me like i did something tho i didnt!! then i literally wrote a whole paragraph saying that im srry and i didnt know that this might bother u and he said no it didnt actully i dont give a fuck and i felt that heeyy wdym anyways the way he talks to me changes so i kept on apologising and then i was like hell nah im not gonna beg u and told him that the reason i spoke about the thing that happened between me and the random guy is because i needed someone to tell and hes th closest one i have and told him how bad i felt when he got angry and that i always think about his feellings and bla bla bla and guess what? he said okay js okay and suddenly sent a whole big message saying that im acting innocent and like an angel and this tyoa shit. i dont say that im perfect but now i did nothing except that i told him and was a big mistake. and all out of a sudden after i bursted in tears he said haha i love making fun of u when ur so emotional like that !! and i was like r u making fun of my feelings ? he said yes and u MUST forgive me as i did nothing in such a way that cant be expressed or explained hes devil walking on earch sometimes i need someone to listen to me as my real relationships got so bad after my phone was took as i dont want them to know, and instead of being in my side he leaves me on seen while and shaking and crying in pain and he knows it! although i gave him everything im not trying to look like an ideal girl or whatever im literally giving him everything i have and what he asks for pics and stuff like that and on the other side he just leaves me on seen,judge me, makes fun of me and my feelings, and we allways fight and hes like ur the one who supposed to say srry even tho hes the one who actully hurt me and hes very narcissistic can u imagine that he call him self sphinx!! and the thing is that when im not comfortable i js keep my mouth shut cuz i got attached and im scared that he will simply leave me cuz he doesnt care as much as i do , i dont wanna be alone i hate to be alone and scared to be alone. i tried to leave him and end up everything million of times but like now hes the only person in this life that i can say hes close to me. i lost my relationship with ,my family friends bf and everything all i ended up with is this guy and 2 of my gurlies that tbh i cant say all of these stuff for them as they r family friends too i dont want them to see the dark side of my life. and knpw day by day im scared that one of us me or my bf losses feelings as we have +2 yrs to wait for and im already started to hmmm ofc didnt loose feelings but its not like the way it was before i know that this is normal but no i dont want to act like this after everything he gave me in this life i rather die on losses my feelling towards him, mintioning that we talked a couple of times after that and everytime we're supposed to say goodbye i drown in pain yk when u just felt that u finally dont have those strong emotions and the need to cry every night then suddenly he comes back again make u living a dream then leaves its so bad for no reason i started self harm tho i was totally against it but i have no one by myside specially that i lost lots of my friends bcz uhh i dont have a phone and we r like teenagers and if someone asked me to go aout i start making excuses cuz like i dont want them to know. so no friends no family no bf just a couple of online friends , alltho they r there but like they r not the kind of people who listen and they usually judge. idk what to do i need support and someone who can tell me their honest opinion and guys please no judgement . i feel like i have sooo much to say and cant express it yet this is the surface of emptynessand lonleyness i wish i can find someone who can listen and be by my side and ofc ill do the same, sorry if i missed it up i told u guys my english is not that advanced but i hope at least i got my feelings across to u and thanks for reading this and i'll be so glad to read ur opinions feel free to write anyyything <3",

I'm so scared they'll divorce. I swear I'm working myself into a paranoia episode or something. I've never dealt with this before and my brain may put things out of proportion because I'm autistic. I just want them to be in love. I want them to stay together. But I know relationships aren't all happy sunshine and rainbows...and they're certainly not...*this*. Idk I just want a hug.",

All the advice i get points that I’ll have to go through years of self improvement until I’m at a level good enough for this (I’m skinny, I have hobbies, I groom myself, not enough still). I feel like it’s a cycle at this point that’ll never break. I left my undergrad with no experience as well, I lost the main opportunity to loose it while others loose it in high school. I feel isolated because I haven’t been chosen or first pick for being myself which has made put myself down. I wish I had a messy situationship or fwb experience so at least I’d know I’m normal and desired. Even if I do loose it, I’ll gonna be forever known as the awkward late bloomer.

My father died when i was 14, so 3 years ago, leaving me, my sibling, 15M and my mum, whose 47. Ever since she started dating her new bf (lets call him J), she's seen less at home and out doing God knows what. Every second day she goes to J's house, and every weekend she leaves for some kind of 2 day-bender before school starts again - meaning i only see her maybe 2-3 days out of 7 per week minimum.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I mean its good that shes moving on, but I thought she would take her children along with her aswell.\n\nI dont know ANYTHING about J, the only reason we found out she started dating in the first place was when my brother accidentally saw a text of them calling eachother love names. I dont even know what the man looks like for crying out loud, and yet he has her more than I do. We never had a good relationship to begin with but I still love my mother. I can't remember the last time she genuinely comforted me, hugged me, said \"i love you\" first, or even said \"im proud of you\" ever since she started dating him. All i hear now are sneers, yelling at the smallest things, riling herself up while she's at home, getting madder and madder when we try to form a connection again.\n\nI already lost my Dad, I dont wanna loose my Mum too.\n\nShe told me shes moving out sometime next year. I'm going to uni next year and she promised me I could live with her until I transfer to a uni out of state like we planned, but now im going to be moved into a shed while my cousin takes our house. My brothers moving out of state to boarding school next year so I'll really be by myself.\nIm grateful she's still paying for the rent and shit, and that she provides for me dutifully but i wish she would just say shes proud of me without me having to force her to.\n\nAvatar 3 is coming up. Avatar was my dads favourite movie while i grew up, and i asked if we could watch the third one together as a family again and she replied: \"No, why would I watch that with you? Go with your friends or something\" \n\nI really wish she would come back",

I was always curious what was going on in their lives when I was growing up.\n\nWhen I became an adult I moved to the east coast for work and finally had the opportunity to go visit my east coast family. I was excited. When I went to meet them again for the first time in a long time, I became saddened because I quickly realized the interest I had in knowing more about them was not reciprocated. It was hard to even meet up with them since they always seemed busy and really had no interest in knowing more about me or seeing me beyond the “obligatory” gatherings like thanksgiving.\n\nSo my whole childhood wondering about them and what was going on in their lives, I realized they probably never even gave me a thought.\n\nThere’s probably not much point to this post, but it was just a disappointment.

He said nothing. A few moments later he says “I guess I was wondering if maybe I could get a hug.” \n\nI say “sure. Why do you ask?” I was just curious if something was wrong. He says “I don’t know. I guess you never really hug me anymore.” I tell him I’m sorry and I give him a hug. We hug for a while. Honestly it felt a little awkward. I’m not sure why. All in my head I guess. \n\nWhen we let go I see a tear. I ask what’s wrong. He says “Nothing. It just felt nice. I’m sorry.” I say it’s okay. I ask if he wants to sit with me a bit. He says okay. He sits beside me and I put my arm around him and we watch tv in silence. I felt tense at first but I started to relax a little over time.\n\nThe next morning I go and give him a hug. He says “it’s okay you don’t have to hug me all the time or anything.” I say I want to. He hugs me back. \n\nAnyways I guess I’m a terrible parent cause my own son has to ask me to hug him and act like I care about him and for some reason I feel weird hugging my own son. End of rant. \n\n",

      "title": "My siblings confessed to my crush that I liked them through a letter.",
      "selftext": "Hello reddit, this happened to me a while ago and I want to get this off my chest. This happened to me while I was in middle school, but first some backstory. I (female) had a crush on this boy, lets name him Ian. We met in 5th grade because I had recently moved. I didn't really know the language, so it was a bit hard for me to communicate, but I learn quickly. We used to hang from time to time and one day in class, Ian got in a fight with one of his friends and the friend angrily admitted that Ian liked me, but of course me being the little rat that I was, I didn't really do anything about it, instead I noticed him more and developed feelings. Fast forward to 8th grade, what I like to think is that nobody knew I had a crush on Ian, but I can't be sure of that. I was living my life how I normally would during that time. My house at the time consisted of me, my mom, my 2 siblings, my aunt and my two cousins. My mom and aunt used to work a lot and were gone majority of the time and I am the eldest, so I had to take care of my siblings and cousins. Lets name them sib 1, sib 2, and cous 1. One night we were watching a show and cous 1 kept telling me I had to confess to my crush, because liking him for 4 years was too much. I told her \"No, I am not confessing.\" It should have been left at that, but she kept going. She started \"joking around\" that she was going to write a letter to confess to Ian that I like him. Both of my sibling joined in the taunt as well saying that it was time for me to confess, I said No again, but they didn't listen to me. They started writing the letter, I go and grab the first one and tore the letter apart and they say \"we're going to make a new one and drop it off at Ian's house in the morning.\" I tried to keep the stationary away and hid them, I also told my aunt, but she didn't really do anything about it. So, the next day passed like normal. Then, came the day after, I was walking to my locker and as I was walking I was getting weird looks and there were whispers around me. Ian comes up to me and says that he doesn't like me and I stop by my locker, my friend comes up to me and I ask her what's going on and turns out that my siblings and cous 1 got a hold of some paper and stationary and wrote a letter and dropped it off at Ian house, which he took a picture of and sent it to the whole school. I was mortified. That day, Ian's friends kept pocking fun and making jokes about the context of the letter. At the end of the school day me and sib 1 were walking home, Ian and his friends were walking behind us. One of his friends come up to us and says that my sister is prettier than I was and the friend group agreed with Ian being the one that was laughing the loudest. Ian then states again that he doesn't like me and that one of his friends did. I look at the friend and he's looking away with pity and then I look away. We walk all the way home with them behind us, when I got home, I start crying my eyes out. cous 1 was home and I asked her why she did this and ran upstairs. Two more days go by and its the same routine, my friend was trying to stop them from making fun of me, (my heart will always go out to her). I got super depressed and almost.... My mom went and talked to the principle and my dad also got involved. Both of my siblings and cous 1 apologized to Ian parents and  myself, but I can't really trust them fully anymore and what adds to the cakes is that my father and step-mom also started making fun of me for having a crush on Ian. Ian and his friends stopped talking about it during school, but Idk about outside. I don't know if people remember it, but I know that Ian does. After high school, there was a couple of times where I saw him, there was this one time I had gone to the park to play with my siblings and I overheard part of a conversation. Again I felt like shit. \np.s. I didn't know what was written in that letter and I still don't know, I heard that Ian's parents threw away the letter or my mom did idk the details, but yea. I am writing this to get this story finally out of my chest. Thanks for reading.",

      "selftext": "Tl;dr - title. \n\nMy marriage was almost 8 years. I ended it early last year. Long story short, it didn’t end well. After things ended and i moved out, i hadn’t dated anyone, been on the apps, nothing. I basically “dated myself” for a year more or less, and i finally felt ready to get back out there. That was in the spring this year.\n\nThen i met him. Let’s call him, E.\n\nE was the first guy, literally, i met since dissolving my marriage. Of course i had spoken to a few different guys once getting back on the apps, but E stood out. We exchanged phone numbers, and basically things got pretty serious pretty quickly after that.\n\nAfter about a month of us dating, we decided to make things official. He decided to make things officially, actually. \n\nEverything was great, and i was so happy that i found a great guy. E was everything my ex wasn’t. And more than that, i wasn’t even thinking about my ex anymore. I was happy being alone and happy being with e! He was genuinely just a great guy. Then after about 2 amazing months, things started changing, and they changed so fast.\n\nE was dealing with the grief of losing his dad. His mom was obviously dealing with that as well, and she got sick. This triggered E’s grief, and he started suffering panic attacks and depression. He would just shut down and stop responding for days. He would contact his work contacts but that’s it. I knew only one of his friends at that point, but i didn’t have her contact information except Instagram, so i reached out to her there. And she couldn’t get a hold of him either. For days. It was really concerning and at one point we thought something had happened to him and we even reported him missing.\n\nI was feeling really overwhelmed and had no idea what to do. On the one hand, yeah i wanted to build a solid, long term relationship with this person. But on the other hand, we were still getting to know each other! And i wasn’t so sure he was unconsciously using me as a distraction (?) from his grief. Not holding that against him, that’s just a natural thing. So i tried to just give him space and wait until he came to me.\n\nThen after days of no contact, he broke up with me.\n\nI felt so…heartbroken. I was really starting to like him. I really let my guard down and i know he was liking me. But i know that he was scared and tbh it just wasn’t the right time for him. It’s selfish for me to ask him to just “try” but. I was heartbroken. We had a real connection. And when i broke things off with my now ex, i felt relief. I felt proud of myself for having the courage to do so. With E, i still am genuinely sad. I really feel like he’s going to be that one who got away… ",

      "selftext": "About two years ago, my mom had a horrible falling out with a longtime family friend allegedly due to some weird romantic tension and as a result she was horribly depressed until a few months ago. During those two years, she would repeatedly express her desire for a new male best friend because, in her words, \"friendships with men just have something special that [she] can't have with women.\" Admittedly the phrasing of that, paired with the fact that she already had many other male friends, kind of icked me out. Over the past few months since she's declared herself \"over\" her former friendship, she has doubled down on her search for a new male bestie - and instead of simply continuing to grow her friendships with her existing male friends (many of whom are either gay or in committed relationships), she has chosen to pursue friendships with men who have approached her with the explicit intent of courting her romantically. I saw a pattern repeating and warned her that she'd become disappointed, but she insisted that the men who wanted to date her \"had the same connection\" that she had with her former male best friend, which has led me to believe the \"something special\" she craves from male friendships is some bizarre form of sexual validation without commitment. On the one hand, I'm so worried about her heart and how disappointed she's going to be, but on the other hand I'm so annoyed because she's way too old to be acting like this ",

Me and my boyfriend are pretty much total opposites. When we met I was a stereotype, a barista with dyed hair, tattoos and a novel she could barely drag herself to write. I was exhausted, lonely and a mess. I’d regularly go to my friends house, drink two bottles of wine and cry in his shoulder about how no one would love me. That’s a fundamental part of this really. I’m young and pretty which makes the sex part of life pretty easy. However, the love part has always been hard and by the time I was 20 I had pretty much accepted that love, marriage and a family couldn’t possibly in the cards for me. I was too loud, too opinionated, talked too much, thought too much. I was too much.\n\nThen he came into my work on a random weekend with one of his friends and smiled at me the entire time I made his drink. After that he showed up once or twice a week after that. On weekdays he’d be in scuffed up work trousers and t-shirts with holes in them and he’d stand there and give me that same smile, the same stupid jokes, he’s draw doodles on receipt paper and tell my coworkers to give them to me. Until one day he saw me sat outside on my lunch break. He sat down across from me, asked for my number and if I wanted to go for a drive with him after my shift.  It was stupid. So stupid. Any other time I would have said no but his stupid handsome face and the way he looked at me made me say yes.\n\nHe’s wonderful to me. I’ve never had someone look at me the way he does. I’ve never been touched like every bit of my skin was precious before. I’ve never had someone so excited to listen to me rant. No one has ever loved and craved me like he does.\n\nAt the same time, I have deeply hated so many men like him. He’s obnoxious, ignorant, loves to say blatantly hateful things under the guise of dark humour and then laugh his stupid ass off about it.\n\nPart of me is so in love with him, I imagine a life with him, what our future home would look like, what our kids would look like because the biggest part of me wants that with him. But, regrettably, a much smaller parts of me that loves to burrow from my skull tells me I shouldn’t want that. Why on earth would I?\n\nI love him. He makes me feel loved. He looks at me like I can do no wrong and I look at him like he’s everything, while behind my eyes there’s a catching at my skull telling me he’s just a warm, comfortable monster that warms my bed.\n\nI love him. There is no part of me that wishes I didn’t. Only the feeling that I shouldn’t in the first place.",

I promised myself from the second time that I’d have to at least advance to the next level. I trained for one year and five months for this.

It was hard since I felt like as if I lost all progress.\n\nOn the tournament day, I felt like I was going to lose. Until I won my first three games. I had this rival from the previous year and swore to myself I’d beat her. I was so closing to winning when I faced her. But due to my poor performance and I was panicking while playing, I lost. After that round, I couldn’t play properly anymore. As if my brain was frying.\n\nThe arbiter made a mistake, instead of giving the point to my opponent since she won, he gave it to me. That’s why I ranked 4th. It hurts. It hurts that I only ranked 4th because of a mistake. The moment I lost to her, I knew I had to be better than her to win. This tournament only happens once a year, I have to be better.",

      "title": "My boyfriend destroyed my deceased grandmother’s jewelry box and I think I deserved it.",
      "selftext": "My boyfriend and I have been together for a year and a half. There have been a few times when he’s blown up on me over the smallest things. Usually, he gets angry and makes it everyone in the house’s problem. When I finally stood up for myself, he hurt me in one of the most painful ways possible. I don’t know if I should forgive him or if the blame is on me.\n\nMy grandmother died of lung cancer when I was twelve. She was the toughest and most hilarious little old lady, and I miss her every day. Everything my grandmother intended to give us after she passed was taken by one of her sisters before we could get to her house. By the time my mom was finally able to get there, very little remained. Among the few items left was a beautiful white jewelry box that could sit on a counter. My mother gave it to me after seeing how drawn I was to it. That jewelry box was the only thing I had left of my grandmother. When I moved out of state to live with my dad as a teenager, it was one of the few things I refused to leave behind.\n\nA couple of days ago, I wanted to get my hair done but was indecisive, so I asked my boyfriend what he thought. I gave him a couple of color choices I was considering; jet black or a random shade of red. He told me he preferred black over red. I took his thoughts into consideration but ultimately decided to go with the red. As soon as he saw me earlier today after my appointment, he was furious, saying I never listened to him and that he was so repulsed by me he couldn’t even sleep with me until I changed it. He called me several expletives. I decided to go lie down and rest before my shift that night.\n\nIgnoring him didn’t diffuse the situation at all. He started grabbing everything that was mine from our shared bedroom and throwing it down the hallway. He kept saying I was in the way and told me to get up and sleep on the couch. He’s done this several times before, and every time he waits until I break down and apologize before I’m “allowed” to move my things back into our room. This can last anywhere from a few hours to a few weeks. However long it lasts, he makes sure my life is a living hell the entire time; yelling at me, belittling me, and telling me what a terrible person I am.\n\nThis time, I was over it. I was too exhausted to play his game, so I just lay in bed, trying to drown out the vile things spewing from his mouth. When he saw he wasn’t getting a reaction, he started breaking things and tearing up my drawings. Before destroying each item, he kept saying all I had to do was get my things out of his room and “get my ugly ass out.” When I still refused, he grabbed my jewelry box and held it over his head. As soon as I realized what he was about to do, I became frantic. I started sobbing and begging him to stop. I was so loud that his mom heard me from her bedroom on the other side of the house and came to see what was going on. She tried to reason with him, but he was enraged. He just kept shouting, “GET THE F*** OUT NOW!” After about thirty seconds of chaos, he slammed my jewelry box onto the floor.\n\nI was speechless. I began to sob, but no sound came out. His mom looked at me and told me to go sleep in her room and lock the door. As soon as I left, I heard her unleashing on him, I am positive I heard her slap him, hard. I just took my blanket and did as I was told. Eventually, I managed to fall asleep. When I woke up, both my boyfriend and his mom were gone. I didn’t have time to question it because I had to go to work. I’m currently on my lunch break and still haven’t heard from either of them. I guess I’ll have to figure out what’s going on when I get off tomorrow morning.\n\nI think it might be my fault he broke it, because all I had to do was get out of the room. My stubbornness destroyed one of my most treasured possessions. I feel like an idiot, and I don’t even know if there’s a way to repair it. I’m just so heartbroken, and I needed to vent.\n",

      "selftext": "I knew this has been coming for months but I still don't know how to handle it. \n\nHe's sick. Stage 4 cancer. He's dropped a lot of weight and needed an oxygen tank and can't get around like he used to. His memory for the past and sense of humor are still there but it's not him.\n\nI don't know how to help my father. He's very to the point about it all. Tends to keep his feelings to himself but I can tell he's devastated. And exhausted. He's essentially stopped his life to go to appointments and care for my grandfather (and by extention my grandmother, his parents) for months. Since the diagnosis. He's exhauated. I can tell. But I can't do anything. And I don't know what I can do to help either.\n\nI don't know how I feel. Sad, mostly, but I'm like my father about it I guess. To the point whenever I talk about it, which is very little. I just take any sort of news and move on. The only time I've cried wasn't the initial diagnosis or with this new news that he's going into hospice, but when I gave my supervisors a heads up about him a few weeks ago just in case. I worry I'll either completely fall apart when my grandfather's passing comes or I'll just stay matter-of-fact like I am now.\n\nWe got his diagnosis the same day my dog died back in the summer. In the last few months my best friend asked for \"space\" only after I checked-in on them after a couple days of ghosting me after a dumb disagreement we had  (Honestly I still don't think disagreement is the right word. I'd say argument but it wasn't even a fight. Bad communication and expectations, really.) I haven't spoken to them since, which is about 3 months, so I think we're not friends anymore. We used to talk every day. I want to talk to them about this but I can't and I don't want to break her asking for \"space\".\n\nI don't feel like I can talk to my siblings about this, which I know is dumb because they're the ones I should or can lean on, but I don't want to have my sadness overshadow theirs I guess? Or bother them with it. We're all our own circles that need to expel our emotions out the circle, not in, and I don't want to clog their circles. But I don't really have any friends (or rather, due to various life things and my introvertedness, my few friends are online and I don't have offline/IRL friends to go to at all) so I guess I'm dumping out here. (How the hell do you make friends in your 30s? I try but worry I always come off too much or trying too hard or coming on too strong because things always fizzle even when things were good in the beginning.)\n\nMy maternal grandmother passed when I was 13. I was sad but it didn't hurt too much because I didn't see her a lot by that point because she lived so far away and she was sick for a while. \n\nBut now I'm an adult. And I saw my grandfather a lot over the years. Being older just makes the realities of life less blurry and more in focus, I guess.\n\nI want to change the channel but the remote's stuck on forward.\n\nWhen I think about my grandfather, I hear his laugh first and see his smile second. He loves scotch and was always ready with a funny story or a joke. He is very intelligent and can share the history and culture of all the countries he's visited at the drop of the hat. He's had so many jobs in his life I can't remember them all. He never eats his vegetables. He never likes to stay on phone calls long but he appreciates the birthday calls. He takes really great pictures. He loves all his grandkids and great-grandkids so much. And I love him.\n\nAnd whenever the time comes, I'm really gonna miss him.",

I didn't belittle her nor humiliate her. All I did was talk to her like an adult because we're both 25 for crying out loud. I thought it was all said and done but girl was replaying our conflict so much that in her eyes I am a bad person. She knows who I am. She's met my other friends and even my family yet that same personality I showed her before; now makes her feel repulsed. I did everything I could to earn her trust back despite how she treated me. She said she doesn't want a friend in her life who points out her behavior because she already knows about it. She also asked me to give her time to process her feelings but all I get in the end was me being cut off from her socials. She removed me from her followers list yet she still follows me. I can't see her grow but she can see mine. How dare she dictate her position in my life? It's so not fair. I had to block her in all of my socials because seeing her name is painful. Goodbye to the memories to which she suppressed meanwhile I am still mourning for the loss. I should've seen the signs from the beginning. She often judges people for who they are yet she doesn't want to be judged. Only she can. She often cuts off people too. Now I know why her ex-best friend said she was problematic. Our mutual friends think of her as a good person but after this incident, all I see is someone hiding their true self. And I feel crazy for being the only person who sees it.",

      "selftext": "Sora 2 and AIs in general made me realize how fucked we are as a species right now. I'm afraid authenticity is starting to disappear. By that I mean people use AI to express themselves instead of creating art on their own terms. People let AI think for them rather than forming their own opinions and they are basically letting CEOs in boardrooms and engineers decide how culture should be consumed and produced.\n\nLet's be real, working in any artistic field becomes less and less viable because people are more ok with consuming AI slop. If artists can’t make a living, only large corporations and AI systems (which were trained on past human art) will dominate cultural production. Future generations might only see machine-generated outputs rather than the evolving human tradition of storytelling, visual art, and music. And If ai replaces creative labor, profits concentrate in the hands of tech companies who own the models, data, and distribution platforms.\n\nAnd let's not forget the philosophical implications:\n\nThis is going to be the End of the human cultural narrative. For the first time, culture might evolve without humans actively creating it. Art becomes an echo chamber of prior data rather than an ongoing dialogue between living minds.\n\nFuck.\n\n",

      "selftext": "I'm 18 years old, and last night I ran away from home at 1 a.m. I put on whatever I could find and didn't come home until morning. My family is quite scandalous, and my stepfather cheated on my mother for half a year four years ago. When she wanted to get a divorce, he beat her up and almost strangled her. I managed to call my aunt, who lived next door, and she took us to her apartment. After that situation, I always wondered what would have happened if my aunt hadn't been there. My mother forgave him, and I know how it sounds, but at the time, I might have understood her, as I have a younger brother with developmental delays, and we needed a lot of money to help him speak. Even at the age of six, my brother still struggles with language. We ran away from home twice, and both times, she returned to him.\n\nI'm 18 years old now, I've been dating a very nice guy for half a year (we've known each other for 3 years), and I'm waiting for him to come back from the army. We have a good relationship with his family and brother, and I'm familiar with all of his relatives. Yesterday, I felt the same animal fear that I did 4 years ago. The argument started from nothing, there was no point, they just started picking at each other. You know, like adrenaline junkies, when they're bored, something like this happens, and then they wonder why I don't want to stay at home. Yesterday was the same, I felt it again, and when I heard a strange sound, like he was grabbing her by the throat, I grabbed the pepper spray, and when I realized that my mother had gone outside for a smoke and my stepfather was checking her phone, I called a taxi and left with a wet head, heading to a different area closer to work. I met a friend who agreed to sit with me, and I had a huge tantrum. I was crying at the top of my lungs, and after I calmed down, I went to another friend's house. I took a day off from work and am currently at home. In the evening, I will talk to my mother-in-law and ask her to let me stay with them. I am willing to do anything, including cleaning, cooking, paying for their accommodation, and buying groceries, just to escape this nightmare. People who have not experienced something like this may not fully understand my feelings, as it is impossible to express them in words. To be honest, something tells me they won't let me stay, but it's worth a try. I can't afford to rent an apartment right now. \n\nI'm glad I could express myself, and it made me feel better. If you need anything, I'll update you.",

Now me and J just agreed to just give me head but before that they asked if I had been tested yet. I said no I was not tested but I remember explicitly saying \"I mean one of my other partners was tested and they were fine\", which was S. Now my wording made it seem like S got tested after we hooked up but actually S got tested a couple months before I hooked up with them. I realized my wording made it seem that way but I didnt correct them and they ended up giving me head. Was I deceptful to them by not making it clear the partner S I was talking about was tested a couple months before I hooked up them and not after? I know that I shouldve gotten tested but I made it clear to J I wasnt but Idk how I feel about what i said after.\n\nLike I knew after I said it how misleading it sounded but I didnt correct it. Idk, how bad was this to do? Like how severe was the act. Was this some form of sexual assault? Ive been reading about people lying about being tested and many consider it some form of rape or assault. Was what I did similar?\n\n",

Im almost 2 weeks post op and I feel back to my normal self. \n\nNow onto the explanation. My husband and I made the decision to be done having kids because my body physically cannot handle another. We have 2 children and I had a miscarriage at around 8 or 9 weeks with a third. It broke both of us pretty badly, but we also knew that if that baby was capable of being carried to term, I would've died from complications from underlying health conditions that tried to take me out with the first two. \n\nIt doesn't help that the pregnancies themselves were absolutely miserable even without my health condtions acting up. I was having to sit on the floor of a grocery store every 3-5 minutes in what would've been a 20 minute shopping trip because I kept getting so dizzy and out of breath that I was getting horrible tunnel vision and would be on the verge of fainting.\n\nAlthough I know 100% I made the right decision in choosing to go through with the surgery, I'm still heartbroken that I won't get my big family I always dreamed of. I wanted 4 and barely survived 2, so I am absolutely greatful for what I have, and I know my youngest will love being the forever baby lol. \n\nAlso: my husband will also be getting a vasectomy in the coming months, he just needs more time off from work to do so. I know the chances of getting pregnant after a tubal are pretty much nonexistent, but I still want to be extra cautious about it and have him get snipped as well lol. ",

He has a distinctive, attractive style that allows him to control and influence others positively.\n\n3.   Skilled at creating an appealing atmosphere around himself that impresses people.\n\n4.   His voice is strong and loud, leaving little room for me or others to speak.\n\n5.   Looks at me with a kind of sympathy, as if he believes he’s on a much higher level than I could ever reach.\n\n6.   His eyes are sharp and captivating, which draws people’s attention and curiosity, a quality that provokes me to compete with him, since I feel I possess some, but not all, of what he has.\n\n \n\n**My personal motivations toward him:**\n\nConstantly comparing myself to him makes my feelings toward him a mix of envy and resentment. I wish to have his positive traits, or strip him of them, so he loses what makes him special.\n\nI also feel he doesn’t deserve the admiration others give him; I want people to turn their attention toward me, not him.\n\nI see him as someone with weak abilities \"shallow and vain\" yet somehow clever enough to attract people despite his lack of depth.\n\n ",

I like to consider myself a professional roleplayer, as I have a degree in the creative writing field and have role played for over ten years. I have always managed to maintain a wall between me and my partners, nothing more than writing partners. It was just a space for me to not be myself, I can enter a world where I’m one of my characters. I can be a mage, a queen, a fighter, a transformer, whatever it is I want to be. It has helped me cope over the years with some hard feelings.\n\nObviously, I would often talk to my writing partners out of character but it never got more than check ins or talking about plot ideas. This one is different. It was just a random rp ad on rp search Reddit. Originally there was a barrier, I had the wall. But he listened to me, he seems to actually care. I honestly really enjoy talking to him ooc too.\n\nI think what started this was having the talk about these characters being a self insert. It was a way to live a life we don’t normally live and having some of our interest and fantasies meant. At first it just made me more fascinated with his character, but then he sent me a picture of himself and we started talking astrology and tarot. It was really nice to just be me with someone and not judged. You see, my last irl partner never liked me when I was myself. Maybe this is just me leaping to the first person who wanted me to just be me. We share pet pictures, he sends me pictures of his country and I share some of mine. We check in on each other and he respects my space when I need it, and I respect his.\n\nI get really excited when he texts me either in the rp or out of character. I mentioned it once and he teased me about it. I just like talking to him in any matter. He tells me I’m his favorite roleplay partner, and maybe it’s a lie but it’s really nice to hear and feel. I have never had such a detailed rp with a partner who matches my levels before, and who enjoys it as much as me. He even encourages me on my art too.\n\nThe issue about all this is he has said he has a girlfriend. I tease that his girlfriend is very lucky because of how he rps. I never want or planned to be the other world or do this sort of thing. I gotta ring it in, but it’s hard. I look at my phone just waiting for his text. I’m just gonna wait it out for now, I just need to get this off to someone.",

I even considered working in two call centers so I could make $1310 monthly (not counting possible bonuses) to help at home the most I could. I know working at a call center really sucks and that traffic hours are horrible but since speaking english is the only skill I have that could assure me more than the minimum wage, it seemed like a good idea. \n\nBefore that, I was accepted at a 3d printing store but again they didn't wanted me to work far from home.\n\nThe jobs I qualify for and that are near me, rarely hire. I've been trying to study to get better technical skills but the fact that I'm not making money stresses me to much to focus. \n\nMy only option left is an online job but again, I don't think I got enough skills for that. I've been thinking of alternatives but they either take too much time or in some way, betray my values.",

      "selftext": "this may be all over the place i don’t know i just need to vent i think. i turned 20f in may and had a serious medical crisis.  \n\ntl:dr at bottom \n(possible TW medical trauma)\n\nright before my birthday i noticed a lump in my breast and have a very extensive family history of breast cancer. i went in as soon as i could. the first doctor basically told me “i don’t know what im looking at and i don’t want to misdiagnose you. you need to see a specialist” not very helpful but i appreciated his honesty and not dismissing me. so it was on to the next doctor. and god that was rough. \n\ni went to a breast specialist, by myself, just for a ultrasound. i didn’t bring anyone with me because it was just. supposed. to. be. an. ultrasound. the tech who did the ultrasound and told me they will have the results before i leave. she went and got the doctor, doctor comes in and re does the ultrasound herself and with a concerned face asks me how old i am. i tell her i just turned 20 and she said “god you’re just so young”. okay unsettling.. she then tells me she wants to do a biopsy and mammogram. the biopsy was supposed to be two days later but she really emphasized she needs it now, so that’s what we did. before that she tells me, along the lines, this could be an infection but we really need to talk about cancer. all i heard was “we need to talk about cancer”. \n\ni do the mammogram and i audibly scream because of how bad it hurt then i go back to the room for the biopsy. bless the doctor and the techs hearts. i’m sitting there just crying with a needle in my boob and said “i told my mom not to come because i thought it was just going to be an ultrasound” they both just held my hands and the tech continued to hold my hand through the biopsy. \n\ni saw the ultrasound and i know what kind of cancer the doctor was thinking of because it looked EXACTLY like inflammatory breast cancer. something i had “looked into” before and thought that would be so silly im only 20! so i get back in my car and just sit there sobbing. all im thinking is im literally 20 years old, have a fatal form of cancer and i just want my mom here. \n\ntwo days after the biopsy, the pain is worse. mind you, i have a solid A cup, when the lump first formed my right breast became a B, then before the biopsy probably a C, then at this point a solid D. \nso i go to the ER. god that was hell. \n\nall i wanted was to know what was going on. the nurse was lovely then the doctor walks in. he asks my name, his name and asks me what’s going on. after i told him he literally just said “you want pain meds?” i was dumbfounded. NO I WANT TO KNOW WHY MY BOOB IS THIS BIG AND IF I HAVE CANCER. after he left the room my mom and i looked at the nurse and she just sighed and said “i know”. he gave me hydrocodone and some antibiotics and sent me home. \n\ntwo days later shit hit the fan. \n\ni woke up feeling horrible, breast was now a full DD, i felt like i was going to throw up, pass out and overall something just felt so deeply wrong. i check my temp and its 99, mom said if it doesn’t get better we are going in. i check it 20 minutes later its 103. we go to the ER and GUESS WHO THE DOCTOR WAS. mr.dismissive. which ended up in my favor he took one look at it and said “i saw you two days ago, you got yourself an admission to the hospital!” \n\nin the ER my bp was 80/60, my heart rate was 110+ the entire time. i got surgery that night to drain the abscess, which luckily, was not cancer! and even after the surgery my bp was still 80/60 the entire next day. but this is where this feeling of trauma comes in. \n\ni look at records while im in the hospital and got my results from the breast clinic and it said i had non lactational granuloma mastitis caused by strep A. that caused me to go into sepsis. \n\nthe hospital stay and afterwards was rough. i was kind of made to feel like i was being dramatic by my mom. i don’t think she meant to idk. but she said “you weren’t really in septic shock they just had to put that down” and i believed it. that i went into sepsis but it “wasn’t that bad and my life wasn’t in danger” \n\nfor the next two months my mom had to pack my breast daily with sterile, iondinized gauze ribbon. it was painful. it was embarrassing. i felt so fucking gross. it was just horrible. i would cry every day.\n\nthe part of this that fucks me up now is that it WAS that serious. i was in septic shock. i did almost die. non lactational granuloma happens in 2-3 women out of 100,000 annually. it being caused by strep A is almost unheard of. and that leading to sepsis is “case report level rarity”. strep A multiplies every 20-30 minutes. if i had waited even a little longer i could have been past the point of return. i could have died. i was in serious shit and i feel so crazy and dramatic. \n\nliterally no one in my life has really seemed to care besides my boyfriend, my sisters and one friend. my friends don’t seem to care. 20 years old thinking i had at most 5 years left because of cancer then almost dying because of septic shock. they didn’t even check in on me. my boyfriend came to see me in the hospital all day the days i was there. everyone has seemed to just move on and forget it. \n\ni can’t move on. i can’t forget it. everytime i think about going to the doctor i have a severe panic attack. i never really liked doctors but now when i think of them i just start sobbing, my heart starts racing, my chest gets tight and i physically can’t breathe. when i get sick now i have a panic attack. when i thought about getting my wisdom teeth removed and not only the surgery, but that it can lead to serious infections i had such a severe panic attack i almost passed out. \n\ni get so angry when i think about the doctor that could have done more at the ER. i get so angry when people who didn’t give a single fuck about my life want to see me or hang out with me. \n\nand i feel so dramatic for all of it. because i didnt die. my heart didn’t stop. i dont have organ damage (that i know of). and i was only in the hospital for three days. i feel like \nit wasn’t that serious when i know it was. i feel like me having some form of ptsd from this isn’t logical. \n\nthanks for letting me vent \n\ntl:dr - doctor though i had inflammatory breast cancer at 20, got biopsy, went to er 2 days later bc it got worse, dismissive doctor thought i was drug seeking even though my breast was three sizes bigger than the other, got worse 2 days later, went back to ER in septic shock caused by non lactational granuloma mastitis caused by strep A now i feel like i have ptsd:P\n",

When you are younger you don’t understand that. You think you have the world at your finger tips and it’s easy to judge everyone with that mentality. I did it too. When I was in my early/mid twenties I judged almost everyone. When you mature in life you start to understand why people are the way that they are and the judgement stops. \n\n",

      "selftext": "I am recently 19, male. For as long as I can remember, I’ve thought about killing myself. That’s not what this post is about. I learned how to not want to kill myself, how to enjoy life. I stopped actively wanting it, stopped hating myself. Sometime after that, I don’t know when, I basically just became a machine that only temporarily experiences emotions. Dissociating entire days, remembering them but not quite existing. I feel more real inside my thoughts, more real here, than I have in the tangible world for the last couple of years. \n\nI watched them go by, did nothing. I live with my mother and step father. My mother is medicated for bipolar, and in my opinion, a narcissist. My entire childhood, I grew up hiding my emotions. I was never allowed to show sadness or anger because I would be punished. Somehow, if I felt them, she would assume I blamed her, which I didn’t, for everything. If I showed happiness, usually for some sort of media whether it was a game, movie, music, or something else, she would only “pretend” to care but in reality she was just sitting on her phone or not listening. I make art, if I showed her the art, art I *am* proud of, art that my friends think is amazing, she acknowledges it with a glance and an empty expression. If I enjoy something she enjoys, I try talking to her about it, but she doesn’t listen. She twists my words into her own shallow meaning instead of sharing any deeper rhetoric. She doesn’t view art, whether it’s mine or someone else’s, the same way. I cannot connect to her, and yet she asks how my day is and if I say it doesn’t matter, she gets upset. If I say why I’m sad, if I tell her what is troubling me, she blames me for things I’ve already disproven. If I say “no it’s fine”, she pressures me. So all I do is wear a mask, pretend to be human. \n\nI believe that I am autistic, though undiagnosed, because of many reasons, from things like the stereotypical “special interests” and being incredibly socially awkward, especially at first when I haven’t recognized their patterns, to hating daytime because I hate how bright and colorful everything is, I hate cloudless days, I prefer when it’s grey. \n\nI have friends and a job. My friends do bring me joy, I love them, they are the family I chose and the mask is more like some makeup when I’m around them. I’m not 100% myself, more 75% or 80% or even 90% myself but there is always something hidden. When I am by myself, I dissociate into daydreams or music or games or tv or movies or any number or things that distract me. Eventually, the emotions will always come crashing down. \n\nLast time this happened, I was reminded of someone I cared deeply about and lost. I lost her because of my emotions getting in the way and my own idiocy. I was working at a store a month ago, I looked up, and I saw her. It was like I saw a ghost. It was really just someone wearing her face. I knew this, and still all of the emotions tethered to her came out, the suicidal thoughts came back, but I was on the clock so I had to sit there and wear a mask. I acted like nothing was out of the ordinary, I pretended to be human. When I got my break, I went to my car and punched my dashboard as hard as I could repeatedly, both to take my emotions out on *something* and because the physical pain kind of brought me back to the physical world. \n\nToday I got home after a day at my new job. I laughed with a friend, talked to my mom. I waited and waited as the rest of the day flew by. My dissociation got disturbed by my mom asking me to walk the dog, and so I did. On my way back to my room, she asked me 4 questions, each one harder to answer. Not because they were deeply personal, not because they were complex, but because after a day of pretending to exist, after a day of being around people, wanting to go to sleep again, it pained me to just speak. When I get like this, it’s easy to keep moving, to do tasks, to do *something*, but to speak is effort. It hurts to talk, like I’m lifting something twice as heavy as me, despite only needing to move my mouth a bit. \n\nNothing will come of this, I just needed to get something out there, off my chest. I don’t know what to do, I don’t know why I would do it. Even if I did, I’m so detached that I couldn’t be bothered to do anything anyways. I am aware this likely sounds like an edgy teenager, I acknowledge that I am still incredibly lucky all things considered and I have a cat who brings me joy. All this is meant to do is lift weight from my shoulders, though I appreciate any comments reaching out. I’m going to bed now, and even if tomorrow isn’t a better day, maybe the next one will be. ",

      "selftext": "I’m just really conflicted at the moment, especially with verbalizing (or writing, whatever) this in general since the last couple times I’ve done so, the people I say this stuff about end up leaving or our friendship becomes one of a “hey, how you doing?” conversation every couple of months.\n\nI should probably just get into the thick it. So my friend [18M] and I [17M] have been friends for several months now. And since then we have gotten pretty close and our relationship is super healthy. Especially considering my friendships and relationships in the past were very rare to be healthy. Lots of abuse and rough shit on both sides. And it’s left me a little nervous about actually initiating anything.\n\nAnd another thing is that I’m confused about if I actually “like like” him. I’ve honestly never really gotten the whole concept but I do want to be with him all the time and be close to him physically and go places with him and show him all these things I like and idk maybe fool around if I ever feel ready for stuff like that. \n\nBut at the same time I’m content with being friends. With him being the highlight of my day and always feeling my day get brighter when he’s around. I’m perfectly fine with our current dynamic but idk, sometimes I just want more if that makes any sense.\n\nI just don’t know if it’s a romantic feeling or not. It doesn’t really feel all that much different then when I have a super close best friend (which he is) and I just want to spend every moment of everyday with him. And I also know that I’d probably get spooked a month in and freak out and just shut down. \n\nAnd if this isn’t a desire for a romantic relationship, but just a super close one, then isn’t that kind of cruel of me to do to him? I know that he likes me and he told me such while we were up late one night talking about whatever subjects we could think of and it just came up. The only thing is that I initially said yes but then changes my mind a couple hours later and then went back to our original dynamic.\n\nAnd then to suddenly switch everything up again feels like I’d just be jabbing a knife in an old wound, you know?\n\nAnd it just makes me worried that I’m just doing the same thing I did with my ex-girlfriend where I just thought I liked her but actually didn’t and then got back together with he later because I thought I liked her again. And that whole situation was a dumpster fire, as you could probably guess.\n\nPlus, on top of that I have pretty bad OCD and mood disorders among other stuff and a whole lot of fucked up shit I’ve done in the past that I plan to take to my grave (or at least until I can get proper therapy which will be a loooong time from now). I feel like it would be unfair to him to deal with stuff like that or not know certain things. I idk. Maybe I’m overthinking things. It’s complicated and I just needed to get this off my chest since I’ve been thinking about it for a while.",

      "title": "I'm worried my dad will not act in time before my brother finishes blowing up his life",
      "selftext": "About a month ago or so, my brother moved back in with my dad under the pretense that he and his girlfriend were separating. Since I've been at odds with them for a while, my dad and his fiancé didn't want me to know why at first but I recently found out it was because my brother's girlfriend was caught hooking up with a friend from Texas. My best guess is that they didn't tell me because they didn't want me going up to my brother with an I told you so,  which I wouldn't have. I don't like to kick people when they're already down. \n\n\nSince my brother has been at my dad's he has been talking to his girlfriend every single day, the entire time he is home, on the phone as if they were still together and nothing had changed at all. It has been bothering my dad's fiancé because he will sometimes FaceTime with her and show her who's at my dad's house and what they're doing when it's none of her business. This matters because I got married this Friday, so my dad and his fiancé were working on the arch all last week trying to see which way would look the nicest and family from far away came to stay at my dad's for the wedding. \n\n\nMy dad's fiancé and a couple family members that were helping her were upset because it was very obvious that he put her on FaceTime to see them work on the arch, they were laughing at them trying to set up the arch, and even talking about what I would wear and saying that it shouldn't be white because I'm not a virgin and a whole lot of other nonsense. My dad's fiancé was upset because my dad wasn't doing anything about it and wouldn't say anything to my brother to make him stop. The one time my dad said something to my brother just so his fiancé wouldn't blow up at my brother herself, my brother denied taking video and nothing happened after that.\n\n\nThe biggest and worst infraction my brother has made has been using the eldest daughter of my dad's fiancé to make his girlfriend jealous. My brother has his girlfriend believing that my dad's fiancé had been trying to hook up one of her daughters with my brother for many years. The younger one doesn't come around much, the eldest has been coming around more often. The eldest has been helping with the wedding and her twin 2 year old daughters were the flower girls. The eldest also has been married for 16 years and has 5 children with her husband. The youngest also has a partner that she has 2 kids with. So my dad's fiancé isn't trying to hook her daughters up with anyone. They have their own lives. Well, my brother had been taking pictures of the eldest when she's there, catching her in awkward situations like when she's bending over, all to send it to his girlfriend and make her jealous. Wanting to take things up a notch, he asked my dad's fiancé for her number saying that he wanted a woman's perspective and wanted to vent to a woman about his situation with his girlfriend. My dad's fiancé knew it was bullshit so she refused. My brother had worked with her husband in the past so he texted her husband asking for her number and whatever he said to him implied that something was going on between the two of them. Now, the eldest has problems in her marriage because of what my brother said to him. Her husband was invited to the wedding and apparently he only went to see how she interacted with my brother since he was under the mistaken assumption that my brother was invited. My dad's fiancé is heartbroken over her daughters situation and is angry at my dad for not doing anything about it.\n\n\nIt also doesn't help that my brother has been allowing his girlfriend to disrespect our dad. Apparently she's been talking really bad about my dad trying to say that he tries to tell her what to do and tries to control her. All because my dad said that our beef happened 5 years ago and it's time to be the bigger person and talk things out with me so that he can have his children visit his home at the same time without the drama. I've been respectful, that's why he was asking her and my brother to be the bigger person since in their version of events I was the one that wronged them when no such thing happened. They refused. My brother's girlfriend has also been saying that my dad is a creep because he has the ability to track wherever she goes when she drives the tesla my brother bought. All because my brother gave my dad access to the app or something. My dad is constantly busy with work, just because he can technically check where the tesla is all the time, doesn't mean he does. It's not his car, so he doesn't care. But now she calls him a creep because of it. Which is stupid because my brother could do the same since I assume he also has access. My brother has been telling his girlfriend absolutely everything that he is told. My dad gave him advice to lawyer up because they have kids together to make sure he can get shared custody and everything and to be careful with her manipulation attempts. My idiot brother told her that so then she said something to the kids to manipulate them into hating my brother and my dad. They were eventually ok with my brother because of whatever she said to them to calm them down, but still hate my dad.\n\n\nBoth my brother and his girlfriend are absolute snakes. My dad's fiancé has already vented to me that they almost broke them apart the last time they tried some BS drama, and she's worried that this time the damage is too great and there will be no coming back together after that. Especially if my dad does nothing about it again. I advised my dad to get him out of his house as soon as possible because my brother would continue to push his luck until my dad got to the point of disowning him. I told him that I understand it seems like a strange notion to him now and that he would never disown his child, but that my brother would push him to that point and that he wouldn't know he had that limit until my brother reaches it. So if he doesn't want that to happen, then he needs to get him out of his house ASAP and stop waiting for him to leave. I told him he doesn't need to stop talking to him and I'm not telling him to disown him, but that he does need to get him out of his house before he does more damage. He said he agreed, but I get the sense he will wait things out, and I'm worried it'll be too late by then. That by that point my brother would have finished blowing up my dad's life, taking advantage that he is too trusting and taking advantage of his kindness. \n\n\nThank you to all of you who read the entirety of my rant.",

I am the only one in my family who has ulcerative colitis (a chronic disease) and struggles from mental illness (bipolar 2, audhd, anxiety, anorexia). I’ve sh for years and been suicidal for as long as I can remember. My brother is a successful lawyer and my twin sister is studying to be a vet. I have felt like the ugly duckling my whole life because they are so intelligent and I was just mediocre. \n\nIt hasn’t helped being a twin because of the constant comparison to her, mentally and physically. She is not very supportive of me and very selfish. I remember one time when I was in so much pain because of my chronic illness that I couldn’t move off the floor. I asked her to go get me pain meds and some water and she looked at me and said ‘why can’t you’. I know my parents support me but I just feel so isolated and alone. \n\nI’m at my second year of University (college) and I have one friend. My only other friend just ghosted me out of nowhere and my ‘other mum’ has done the same thing both at the same time. I will admit, in the past few months I got addicted to opioids, and it had a small impact on them, but I am clean now and acknowledge and own my actions and apologised for them. They’ve both just dropped me at the same time and I only have one other person. I feel at an all time low and haven’t felt this suicidal since I was 14. I genuinely don’t know how to move forward. I’m in a constant state of either not eating or eating too much and I never feel stable. I just don’t know. I’m so depressed and lonely I have no one in my life. I just want to end it all so badly I don’t see a future for myself. I think maybe I’m feeling a bit down because it’s 2 years since I was sa’d on 1 October but I have been like this for weeks. \n\nI feel like this doesn’t grasp the truth of how I feel and I seem dramatic, but I can barely get out of bed most days. I go to work (I work as a nanny in the morning) and then come home back to bed for the rest of the day. I have nothing left for me. ",

And guess what? She gets angry. Even though I asked her because I know she doesn't like it when I use logic with her.\n\nThen she says that I “want to put her down,” when I'm just trying to help her.\n\nWhen she came up with this job, I gave her my full support, and then the problems started:\n\nThe job was 30 hours a week and she arranged her schedule. Her idea was to have appointments from 8 a.m. to 12 p.m. and then from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Thursday and have Fridays off. I said that it would be too much and she didn't like that, said she wasn't willing to sacrifice Fridays, and okay.\n\nLess than a month later, she was already burned out and only talked to me to complain about work. Every now and then, she would miss or postpone sessions... Then she decided to switch to 20 hours a week. And guess what? Nothing changed. She continues to complain and can't stand working. To me, it's obvious and logical that she doesn't like her profession.\n\nThen there's also her family situation at home. she lives with a sexist and aggressive father who threatens and swears at her when she goes out. Basically, he can't know that we go out, even though we've been dating for a year. She constantly complains and laments about how she has no friends, how her family annoys her, how her father is a jerk, and SHE DOESN'T TRY TO CHANGE ANYTHING.\n\nShe can't go out because of her father, and when she does go out (in secret), she has to be home by 10 p.m., etc. How is she going to make friends? At least the kind of friends she wants. How is she going to live?\n\nThen I talk about how, given her current financial situation, it would be possible for her to move out on her own, but she simply doesn't want to and thinks it's wrong of me to bring it up.\n\nAnyway, after she mentioned that I put her down, when I'm literally just trying to help her improve our relationship, I said that I'm not doing that, I'm just using rational arguments, and if she feels diminished by that, it's something she has to work on herself.\n\nHer response? “Yeah, until I decide I can't take it anymore.” I just replied, “What a joke,” and she went to sleep, but I wanted to respond, “Then end this relationship and continue for I don't know how many more years in the situation you find yourself in.”",

And it’s not just the high I feel when he compliments my singing abilities, or how good I perform during my private lessons. I should add, also on stage as well. I forget about everything when the music begins. My lower ranking status with my colleagues, being poor, grocery prices, etc. It’s like nothing else exists in the world than me, my talent, and my voice. I was cramping on my period today, forget about that one too the moment I begin singing!\n\nIt feels so amazing to really sing! Play my instruments at home! I can go on a range of five octaves! Whistle notes!  There was a time I asked him “How come you wanted me help me?” He said “I just knew. He believed in me and saw my potential the moment I started taking vocal lessons before I knew it myself how far I’ll go. \n\nAre the lessons a little bit pricey? Yes. But was it so worth it after two and a half years of practicing, five octave ranges, and my highest note being an octave 6E flat?

      "selftext": "Throwaway account because of personal details.\n\nI'm (M25) generally happy, but once or twice a year I spiral into a really deep and dark hole.\n\nThree years ago, I took a job that pays decently and is interesting. I travel solo or with a colleague from construction site to construction site, all over the world. Usualy for a few months in a row, and in between a few weeks at home.\n\nI do like the work. New challanges, travel, and some wild stories/experiences. One of the reasons I took this job was because life felt like a hamster wheel. Every day and week looked the same. Predictable, repeditiv, booring. The new job broke that cycle, and I’m honestly glad I took the risk.\n\nI’ve never been very social. I’m an introvert (INTJ-personalety and a bit a workaholic). I always had a small circle of friends. Even as a kid, I mostly played alone. I wasn’t into clubs, sports, or anything like that. I was a Gamer kid. And still am, to some extent.\n\nDuring the Job Interview they told me that the job is not always easy. I have seen that already at that point. It's not a normal 9-5 job and your away from home. But beleved I could handle that. And so faar I mostly did well. I've seen and heared colleagues burn out, develop alcohol problems, go through breackups, divorces, or going in the redlight districts as a replacment.\n\nBut even though I’ve avoided most of those extremes, I still find myself slipping into depressive episodes. Feeling incredibly alone. Starved for touch. Love. Anything, really.\n\nOne night I couldn’t sleep. I got out of bed at 2am and ran 10km (untrained) at high pace to overstrain my body. I had to be up at 6. I usually don’t even work out. But the pain felt better than lying alone in bed with my thoughts.\nIt wasn’t the only time. I sometimes hit the gym or run until everything hurts.\nI guess ther's some truth to the meme \"If you're ever feeling sad, just go for a run. Coz then you'll realise that your physical health is way worse than your mental health\".\nSome coworkers are even into marathons because it “clears their head.” I guess that’s a shared coping mechanism. At least healthier than drinking\n\nBack in school I wasn’t really interested in females and after age 17 I’ve mostly been surrounded by men due to the job. I’m still a virgin and have no real idea how to talk to women.\n\nI’ve tried dating a little bit.\nI once while drunk at a party, and ended up being a creep. I felt awful afterwards.\nOn a more serious date, I tried to be respectful and tryed my best to not be a creep. It was, Ignoring my missing smaltalk and general Converstion scills, okay. \nI’ll keep trying when the time feels right. I know I willbmess up, but I also will learn. Still, I’m scared of ending up alone. I don’t want to be that 30/40-year-old guy with no experience.\nIt's hard when you’re always on the move. And I’ve seen multiple colleagues relationships, fall apart. I already know, the next overseas job starts and all will fall appart...\n\nStill… I’m desperate for touch. One Frend once mentioned how I always hug pillows when I sleep. Not the first time i've nothiced that on myself.\n\nAt some point, I even seriously considered getting a Brazilian wax just to have someone touch my junk. I would also not mind if it was a male waxer.\nI knew it was dumb, but I couldn’t stop thinking about it for some time. Eventualy I realized the waxing idea (it stayed just a Idea) was kinda problematic with that background. \nI booked a tantra massage with a happy ending instead. It was nice… but also clearly professional. No emotional connection. No warmth. And also not the Direction I wanted to go, but here we are...\n\nI guess I willstart looking for some sort of F+ relationship or casual hockups. It’s also not what I really want, but better than nothing?\n\nThank you if you made it this faar. Any ideas/inputy/advice is welcome.",

      "selftext": "Last night I went to a party with my bff. (We are both non binary and lesbian. And we're both 22) Originally my roommate was supposed to come too, but they got sick the night before from trying tequila and discovering that they are allergic to it. Anyways I was admittedly kinda nervous about the fact that it was just us going. I think I was nervous because I knew that I like them as more then I friend, I just pretend to try and convince myself that I don't sometimes. \nAs the night goes on we make friends and have a good time. \n\nEventually my bff gets pretty drunk and asks if I wanna makeout. Obviously I couldn't pass up the opportunity even tho I kinda knew my heart would hurt the next day. After we made out, they said \"can I tell you something kinda gay?\" \nAnd then they said if we weren't best friends we could be dating or we could be in love, something like that, something that hurt my heart. Part of me wanted to ask why not? But my brain felt too fuzzy to even know how hearing that really made me feel. But I think even then I knew that they would regret saying that, and regret asking to make out with me multiple times, regret moaning in my mouth and bringing up the fact that they moaned in my mouth multiple times. I wanted to pin them against that railing and touch them all over like they gave me permission to do. But I couldn't. Cause it would've hurt even more then it already does. They asked me to dance with them too, hold their small hips agasint the rhythm. When we were outside waiting for our uber, there were these cute apartments, and they were talking about how nice it would be if we lived there. We could party all the time, and my dog could live with us, they said something along those lines. What am I even supposed to say to that???? And and and they asked me if we are going to sleep in my bed tonight , and while they said it they had the cutest little smile I've ever seen. And I after I said yes they smiled ever moreeeeeee. It destroyed me.\n\nBut when we did get home, I didn't even rub their back, or play with their hair, or try to cuddle, because that shit is my favorite shit, and it hurts so badly when they regret it the next day. But I did feel them right next to me all night, and unfortunately it is the most safest feeling like always 🙄🙄🙄\nI had to work this morning, and when I got home they seemed very excited to see me come home! But I just reacted very nonchalantly because I was feeling extremely in love with them and I don't believe they feel the same. Then they seemed really stressed and anxious and ended up leaving even tho we were thinking of maybe going skating with another friend. \n\nThen they called me crying later today and told me their ex gf postponed when she could give them their stuff back AGAIN! and that someone tried to break check them on their way home. They were also upset cause they were feeling like a bad friend for not wanting to skate anymore but forgetting to tell our other friend. I told them that I bet a million dollars that not a single one of their friends thinks of them as a bad friend, and that everyone forgets things sometimes. But I wanted to go on a whole fucking list of all the wonderful things they do for all their friends that make them feel special. Just being around them is enough to make anyone feel special. They are like the feeling of warm sun on your skin. Oh God im so gay 😭\nI wish I could keep them safe in my pocket forever.",

I don't think I would be as implicated if I didn't feel guilty.\n\nIronically, my friends know me as a very emotional person because I cry a lot during movies. Watching a film seems the only time the emotion of others reach me and I love it, I love to share the sadness, the joy, the scares. My parents told me I always strongly reacted to fiction. As a kid, I would hide behind the couch because I was overwhelmed but I would peak to continue watching the movie.\n\nIf I'm writing this now, this is because some of my friends are starting to see it too. They say I'm caring in every day life but find me cold sometime. I'm a bit freaked out because I fear so much to be discovered.

      "selftext": "I \\[33F\\] had known this guy \\[33M\\] casually for about 6 or 7 years. We started dating exclusively back in late winter, we hit all the typical relationship milestones, we had concrete discussions about plans for the future, the level of interest and contact was so high from both sides that there was no doubt that we were each easily the most important person in the other's life. Two months ago, I made a trans-atlantic trip to spend two weeks in his hometown and meet his parents. It went really well, he had got them all excited about me and they were not disappointed. I felt closer to him after that, and all signs clearly pointed to the relationship progressing.\n\nThree weeks ago, he started pulling away suddenly, but denying it. I gave him the benefit of the doubt that he was just in a mood and it wasn't about us/me, but then he finally admitted that he felt like we had moved too quickly and he wanted to slow things down. I was surprised, and hurt, but I could live with that. Within 48 hours, he told me he actually wanted to just break up, but was tearfully begging to remain friends, insisted that he still loves and cares for me so much. I told him there was no way I could just be friends. He knew how much I want a family and how worried I am about never finding someone before I'm too old and biologically incapable of having children, and there was no way I could 'stay friends' with someone who ripped that promise away from me, and potentially see him keep that promise to someone else. No fucking way.\n\nI didn't talk to him for a week after that, until he reached out and made some very vague statements seeming to walk back some of what he had said. In response, I laid out my perspective on the whole thing. He told me he would need to take his time to read it over, think about it, and respond. It's now been a week, and he still says he isn't ready, but he keeps making light friendly chat with me here and there in between. It's un-fucking-believable to me that this has happened. It feels like a beautiful dream that suddenly changed into a nightmare.\n\nStupid me still wants to hear what he has to say in response, but I'm done with the in-between small talk.",

      "selftext": "I’ve been thinking a lot about how we were all taught that “money can’t buy happiness.” For decades that line has been repeated so often it’s practically a moral law. Since a *very* young age, I’ve had a strong feeling that it was bullshit, but lately it’s been much more overt and on the surface. \n\nEverywhere I look, people who are financially comfortable radiate something different. It isn’t fake smiles or surface-level excitement. It’s deeper and isn’t necessarily fleeting. Financially liberated people often live in a continuous hum of satisfaction. It’s the natural emotional baseline of someone whose every physical, social, and existential need is funded.\n\nThis doesn’t necessarily mean they’re running around in a manic state of joy every day. People *do* adapt to comfort, but not entirely. Positive emotion continues to rise when people gain stability, options, and freedom from constraint. It’s more like they plateau into calm and spontaneity. That is happiness. It’s what life feels like when every practical concern has been lifted/is nonexistent… when you can make choices from freedom, not uncertainty or survival.\n\nWhat if the whole “hedonic treadmill” idea, the claim that people always adapt and end up no happier after getting what they want, was just another way of downplaying how transformative being in command of a large sum of money really is? A story told to make the rich seem no better off than the rest of us, when in fact they’ve accessed a level of peace that most people never reach? if happiness does indeed scale somewhat linearly with money, then vast inequality means vast inequality in lived emotional quality. It seems like a pretty obvious lie to tell in such a reality.\n\nWe might be living through a cultural moment where that old myth is falling apart. The joy of solvency and abundance isn’t just a private experience anymore; it’s visible, embodied, and spreading. I believe we are collectively witnessing the demystification of wealth’s joy.",

      "selftext": "My friend and I were inseparable for so many years. We did everything together laughed, cried, fought, made up, had sleepovers, even stayed on the phone every night until we fell asleep. Our families were close too. She was more like a sister to me than a friend.\n\nAs we got older, things started to change. She went away for a few months (keeping this vague for privacy), and while she was gone, she cheated on her boyfriend. At first, she told me it was “just a kiss.” I don’t agree with cheating, but I tried to let it go because people make mistakes.\n\nBut then, when she came back and stayed at my place, she was on the phone with this guy the entire time. Showing off her new dresses to him, showing her body. She ignored me, her family, and even her boyfriend. She literally slept on the phone with him in my house. A few days before that, her boyfriend had caught her sending risky pictures to this same guy, and instead of coming clean, she made up a lie and he forgave her.\n\nThen things escalated…..she asked me to buy her a pregnancy test because she had been sleeping with this guy the whole time she was away. After it came back negative, she sent him a picture of the result and immediately started making plans to hook up again once she went back. They were cracking jokes as if her boyfriends wasn’t standing just outside where we were standing.\n\nThat’s when it hit me: this wasn’t just a “mistake.” She was actively betraying him. I felt awful having to keep that a secret. I wasn’t super close with her boyfriend, but we were cool, and I couldn’t watch him or anyone get played like that. She could’ve given him an STD, or actually gotten pregnant on him. I ended up telling him everything a few nights later when I told my friend she needs to tell him. Granted, I never really gave her much time to tell him herself. It all happened within like 5 minutes. \n\nShe told me I need to stay out of her relationship. After that, we didn’t speak. We haven’t spoken in years. They ended up staying together and they just got married. I didn’t tell him to break them up but if your going to enter a long term partnership i would want him to have all of the information to make the best decision for himself. \n\nI miss my friend, I really do. We were friends for so long, and losing that friendship feels like losing a family member . Sometimes I regret telling him because it cost me our friendship, and everyone told me I shouldn’t say anything, that it’s not my business and sometimes I think they are right. But I believe you reap what you sow and if I don’t say anything, something worse could happen to me later on in life. I would want someone to tell me without hesitation.\n\nI don’t really know how to feel anymore. I just know I miss the friendship we once had, even if I can’t ever get it back. Sometimes I wanna reach out and apologize for what I did. Maybe I shouldn’t have gone about it like that. All I know is I miss my friend.",

I am from India and I watch anime since I was a little kid so I was always shaped by Japanese culture and I can also speak a few Japanese sentences. My name is Pajeet but all my friends have started to call me Izumi because I seem so Japanese. Sometimes I even talk in Japanese on accident and not in Hindi, and I believe that’s my Japanese side in me taking control. \n\nI have tried to be a normal Indian, but I just don’t belong here, I should’ve been born in Japan. Don’t misunderstand me, I love India, but even my looks are more Japanese than Indian. Every day I do exercises to shape my eyes more Japanese and I am also build like a Japanese man. I am really strong and have a lot of muscle. Every girl in my school is in love with me, and that is for two reasons:\n\n1 I look like a main character from an anime and\n2 I always ignore them. \nNo matter how hard they try to get my attention, they just can’t. I am usually more of a silent guy, but I study every of their moves and read them like books. Sometimes I even manipulate them into thinking I am stupid or weak, but they just won’t leave me alone. I just look too good, I guess. However, they don’t know the dark face behind my every-day-mask. I am not a good person, and by rejecting the girls, I am just trying to protect them from myself. \n\nWhen I get older, I will move to Japan, to be among my kind. Everyone there is as muscular and smart as me, and the girls know how to respect a man and his abysses. Once a Japanese tourist girl was in my suburb and she instantly fell in love with me. I followed her around, and when she was alone, I talked to her. Of course I automatically manipulated her, but then I decided to tell her about the real me. About the monster inside me and the voices I hear sometimes. How I was actually Japanese, just born in the wrong country. She was really nice and agreed with everything I said. I even told her, that I loved her in Japanese. Though, she looked little bit frightened of me, which I can understand, so I just walked away. \n\nI am 17 years old and almost everybody treats me like a Japanese now and also calls me by my Japanese name. I also eat a lot of rice and sometimes sushi. No one else that I know likes rice as much as me which is another indicator that I am actually Japanese. \n\nHow do you all think about that?",

Im in my thirties, so ive grown up through many collector fads. Its such a shame that once niche hobbies have become popular just so somebody can make a few extra dollars, while ruining it for many people they not even aware of. Ive  realized more and more that the world tries so hard to be \"inclusive\" and its really causing people to not know who they are. You cant feel special if everybody is special. You cant be proud of something that everybody else has jumped on the bandwagon.  \nI dont understand why people make accounts on  Instagram &TikTok just to spill leaked information to the masses. I think its repulsive and honestly, GET a REAL job. Ha! I'm not trying to be mean but it's just sad that people mark up things so incredibly high. \nIts a shame that these influencers and just side pages or accounts not even affiliates, are only adding to the problem. I am not trying to be mean but I am sure many people believe they are helping spread the word of good products. No your helping people buy mass quantities and ruining it for everybody else. \nEven at Starbucks the holiday cups people would buy in mass quantities so they can sell in their shops at double if not triple times the amount. \nIts so sad we cant have anything good.

      "selftext": "\n\n***I have the entire extended story on a google document, but I'll post a condensed version on here since not everyone wants to read the entire constitution. note that this is all coming from my perspective and feeling, and i do not intend to make my statements accusatory.***\n\nAbout a month ago, I had a fall out with a friend, let’s call her L. We were getting closer and talking more, but one day she mentioned a preference that she didn't like. I respected that boundary, but because of my past trauma, it triggered my boundaries in my past often came right before being cut off. I told her I wasn’t feeling comfortable *in the moment* (meaning within myself, not with her), but she seemed to take it personally. Later that day, she blocked me and removed me from our group chat without any explanation. It felt like rejection all over again and mirrored old scars of abandonment.\n\nHurt and confused, I wrote out my feelings... paragraphs processing what happened. It wasn’t to attack her but to reclaim my voice when I felt erased. Another friend, K, who said she’d support me, called me and listened for a while. I shared the paragraphs with K about processing what happened with L and ended up forwarding them to the group chat. then said she’d check back in 10-15 minutes… but instead, she blocked me too. That one especially hurt... it felt like betrayal because I had just opened up to her and trusted her word...\n\nAfter that, I tried explaining what happened to two others from the group, C and R. With C, I tried to talk about how the whole thing was a trauma response for me, not “drama.” She accused me of “playing the victim” and said I “needed help.” For someone who claimed to understand mental health, her responses felt condescending and pathologizing. When I defended myself calmly and clarified what I meant, she told me “being hurt by a boundary is on you” and “the world doesn’t revolve around you.” Then she blocked me too. That interaction reopened old wounds, I felt silenced, misunderstood, and stigmatized.\n\nR was more patient, but still seemed to minimize things. She told me that L blocks people to “avoid drama,” which didn’t sit right with me. Avoidance isn’t the same as setting a boundary... it shuts down dialogue entirely. It felt like she was defending L instead of acknowledging how deeply it hurt me. I admitted I wanted to apologize to L for how my words might’ve landed, but I also wanted others to see that blocking without communication isn’t neutral. It leaves wounds behind me...\n\nI later found out that L told the group she blocked me to “avoid drama” and that I got upset “for no reason.” That made me feel erased... like my pain was written off as irrational. I know I wasn’t perfect and that my emotions probably landed hard, but my goal was always reflection and dialogue, not conflict.\n\nAt the end of the day, I’ve learned that avoidance might protect some people’s comfort, but it can also silence others' pain. I still wish there could’ve been an honest conversation instead of everyone blocking me. I’m not looking to rekindle friendships, just closure and maybe understanding. This just felt like I've been set up to fail around them.\n\nNo one even ever took the time to ask my perspective or hear me out. It's just getting blocked when I try to speak my perspective.",

      "title": "Why do bad things happen to good people?",
      "selftext": "\nI’ve been carrying this for a long time and I think I just need somewhere to let it out. I feel like I’ve become so disillusioned with the world and I don’t know what to do about it. I’ve always been such a positive happy person, but I feel like I’m caving in on myself. I need to tell someone about all of this, and I can’t think of anywhere else to do it. So, here goes. \n\nMy mother is the kindest person I’ve ever met in my entire life. She’s so filled with love and compassion for everyone around her, and is so unbelievably selfless, she feels like a saint on earth. When she was a kid, she’d watch things like a ‘puff the magic dragon’ animation where puff’s kid outgrows him and leave puff all alone, and be so upset and filled with empathy for a fictional dragon that she’d cry about it for actual days. Even now, with her almost being 50 years old, there’s a lot of things that I can bear to tell her because I know it’ll make her cry. \n\nIn spite of that, my mom has been through so much throughout her life. She suffered from an eating disorder in her teen years that her self image has never completely recovered from, and at sixteen her mother disapproved of the boy she was dating, and forced her to date a 23-year-old out of town for the next few years. When my mom was in her early 20’s, she married my dad. He turned out to be sexually abusive, and because of her sheltered Christian background she don’t realize marital rape was even something that was wrong. He would demand sex three to four times a week, and if she didn’t agree, he’d take his anger out on us, her four kids. She developed multiple UTI’s throughout their marriage because of his behavior, but my dad was a doctor and would simply refuse to believe she was actually getting sick because of him. She took so many antibiotics that they stopped working, and I still remember the last few christmases before she left him, when she had such terrible vertigo because of all her health issues that she couldn’t even join us for Christmas dinner. Instead we’d find her sitting on the kitchen floor holding her head, and she’d just tell us not worry. Despite everything she was going through, I never even knew it was happening. She kept every single aspect of her pain to herself. Even when she could barely manage to take care of herself, she put all her time and energy and everything she had into loving us. I never saw her fight with my dad, except for when she’d try to defend us from his rage. She worked so hard and did everything for us, while developing PTSD, and seeing her health waste away. Finally, after 15 years of marriage she realized she couldn’t survive any longer if she stayed with my dad, and announced a divorce. He was immediately furious at her and would send thousands-of-words-long messages berating her, calling her every cruel name he could think of, telling her she was ruining our lives, doing everything he could to hurt her as much as possible. And still, we didn’t notice a thing. She barely told us anything about why she was separating from our dad because she was afraid if we knew the extent of what he had done to her, it would ruin our ability to have a relationship with our father, and hurt us. \n\nMy dad, meanwhile, turned into some kind of monster. I never had a close relationship with him to begin with. I remember when I was seven years old, realizing I loved my mom more than my dad, and then feeling bad for him. Whenever he got home from work, I’d act all excited and run to hug him because in my child mind I thought, “we all like mom better, and that must make him sad,” so I tried to show him extra love so he’d be happy. He used to blow up at us every other week. My siblings were all terrified of him, he’d hit my older brother and I when we were really little but my mom managed to get him to stop. But after my mom left him, it was like he went crazy. He got it in his head that I’d somehow known about the divorce ahead of time, and was conspiring against him with my mom or something, and made it his mission to convince me to hate her if it was the last thing he did. He’d scream at me and take my devices for trying to contact her when I was with him, read my text messages with her and then mock me for what I said, and spend hours late at night ranting to me about how she was a liar, a conniving bitch, a horrible evil person, refusing to let me go to bed until I agreed or he ran out of steam. I wouldn’t talk shit about my angel of a mother with him, and it just made him angrier. He’d feed lies to my siblings too, telling them she ruined our family and cheated on him and anything else he could think of. And the worst part? The worst part is that my older brother started to believe him. After everything my mom went through, everything she endured for us and all the pain she suffered, the one thing she did to save herself? My brother started hating her for it. He started spending all his time at our dad’s house, told my mom she was just as bad as him, and everything would’ve been okay if she’d just bit the bullet and stayed. And my mom feels GUILTY for it! She shouldn’t have to feel guilt for anything, but now her son barely responds to any of her messages since going to college because in all her life, she did one thing for herself. I don’t understand why he can’t see that my dad is a horrible person. \n\nBut that’s not even the worst part. In 2021, my mom got Covid. At the time I was seeing my third therapist since the last two called my dad a narcissist and he fired them, and this new therapist was a man who had grown up with an abusive alcoholic father and had started telling me that I was just as much of a problem as my dad was. At the time, I was 13 and refusing to see him unless we went to family therapy to work things out, and I didn’t know yet that he was never going to change. But for my mom, she was still receiving the cruelest text messages my dad could possibly muster, at the same time that we texted her things like “dad yelled at us again, I’m scared” “mom, I miss you” “I really need a hug.” \n\nOne day our dad got angry at us for contacting our mom again and took about phones, saying we were never allowed to contact her on his time. We were broken down on the side of the road at the time, and my mom had no idea if we were okay. She asked my therapist at the time what to do, and what did he tell her? That SHE needed to stop triggering my dad. After spending a decade and a half destroying herself to bend to his will, currently terrified for her children’s safety and racked with guilt for leaving us alone with him so she could be safe, this man told her that my father’s rage was HER fault. At that point, her COVID triggered an autoimmune disorder that had been dormant in her body and she was suddenly allergic to almost every food on planet earth. To this day, four years later, she can only eat microwaved lamb, iceberg lettuce, and salt (she recently lost the ability to have olive oil) with no current visible progress or path to recovery. And my dad is still abusing my siblings, and causing her as much pain and stress as he possibly can. It isn’t fair. I can see her suffering weighing on her. Her health is getting worse, and I’m terrified soon she won’t be able to eat anything at all and I’ll lose her. I’m only seventeen years old, and I just want her to be okay. My mom has taken my dad to court countless times, bringing binders of evidence of how my dad continues to use his position as a co-parent to abuse and control her and cause her as much stress and misery as he can, and the judge doesn’t even read the fucking documents and sends them to counseling like that will help anything. Why isn’t there anyone who can intervene and stop him? Why isn’t she getting any better? We had to move out of our house because it was full of black mold, our new place had it too so she moved to her parents’ house, and then our cars all flooded from a hurricane, their pipes burst and destroyed our floor, my mom lost her job at our school, her girlfriend betrayed and left her after my dad started dating her ex. Why doesn’t anything go right for her? I always used to believe that things would get better eventually, and that if you projected love and kindness out into the world then it would come back to you, so why is it that all my mom gets in return for all her love and kindness is suffering? I hate my dad so much. I’m so angry and hopeless and scared. Why are things like this? ",

I made him my priority, stood by his side during his stressful job, period without work, and illness. Financially, emotionally, and physically, I was always there for him and expected nothing in return. I cared for him when he was sick, guided him toward financial stability, encouraged healthier lifestyle choices, and emotionally supported his family endlessly. I even became vegan for him, despite severe health issues that made intimacy impossible, caused gut problems, and led to vitamin deficiencies. I spent a significant amount trying to fix my health and leaned on him during the tough times I faced in my own life, but he never cared enough.\n\nDespite all of this, he left me without closure. He’s now happy and relieved, while I’m left processing the betrayal. He rationalizes leaving with excuses: s*x, veganism, being ‘single at heart’, my choices about kids and many more. For a year, he experimented with single life, all while assuring me his willingness to marry me. He continued trying to have sex and taking my comfort when sick all while planning to leave. I lost myself, my self esteem and my voice being with him. I realized he was constantly seeking attention from random women. He left with just a mere note, even resenting me when I showed up with love and care seeking closure.\n\nI don’t regret loving him, but I feel lost and shattered. How do you recover from giving your all to someone, only to be abandoned and rationalized away? Any advice or similar experiences would help. I don’t believe in love anymore.",

      "selftext": "My head and my life are a mess right now.  \nI admitted I am not a good person; I don't treat my partner well.\n\nI am 27, and my partner is 25. We've been in a relationship for 8 years now, planning to get married next year or the year after that. We fight like a normal couple, but every time we argue, I feel like I'm the only thing separating her from her happiness. I am the wall between her and her freedom. I hate that feeling. I've tried to talk things out, but she won't listen. I know deep down she loves me, maybe much more than I do.\n\nI work multiple jobs and earn stable money, at least in this place. She demands that I earn MORE, which drains me inside and out. I work around 15 hours a day at multiple remote jobs from different places with different desk jobs and different time zones. She always demands that I talk to her or accompany her, which sometimes tires me out. She is clingy and fussy.\n\nWe adopted 2 golden retrievers. I already knew she couldn't handle these 2 boys, but she insisted anyway. Now I need to take care of these 2 boys, even when I'm really drained. She doesn’t work because she comes from a much wealthier family, and her family treats me well. I live with her family, as my own family is basically a broken mess. My dad doesn’t want to work, and my mom keeps asking for money.\n\nI met a girl online, who’s around 22. Age is not the problem; she’s awkward. We only talk online for now, since I can't meet her because my partner will ask hundreds of questions before I even start the car. But I feel comforted when I talk to her.\n\nShe doesn’t dress better than my partner; she dresses very quirky (not in a \"pick me\" way).  \nShe doesn’t go hanging out in cafes like my partner; she works in cafes every day.  \nShe isn't rich; she can't even afford an iPhone.  \nShe doesn't constantly need me; she already knows what she is going to do.\n\nToday is her birthday, and I was planning to buy her a new phone.  \nBut she didn’t respond, and it turns out she already has a boyfriend.  \nObjectively, I feel like I am a much better person than her boyfriend.  \nHe doesn’t earn as much as me, doesn’t look as good as me. The worst part is I don’t feel bad thinking about this.\n\nI was crushed. I didn’t talk to or see my partner today, hiding behind my work, but what I truly felt was defeat.  \nI was defeated by my own expectations.  \nI was defeated by my own ego.  \nI was defeated by my own desire.  \nI was defeated by my own self.  \nHow rotten am I to not let go of my partner, but demand that another girl, who is already in a relationship, love me back?\n\nYesterday my partner and I fought because she kept asking me where I wanted to go. I was seeing a friend that she knew very well. The barrage of questions infuriated me, and we got into a big fight. I ignored her for the whole day.\n\nThis evening she came to me and said she was sorry, that she wanted to change for a “better us,” all while I am heartbroken over some girl who’s in a relationship.\n\nGod, I am pathetic.\n\nI hate this feeling, and I don’t know where I want to go from now on, but writing this reduces the stress a bit, just a tiny bit.\n\nMaybe don’t try to judge me, since I’ve already heavily judged myself; it won’t make any difference.\n\nThanks.",

      "selftext": "I work two jobs. I'm basically a teacher for workers and I work with marginalized people.\n\nThere's one bit of context : 20 years ago my co*ntry decided that people with handicap should be included everywhere. It was only really enforced recently. \n\nSo for years I've been teaching workers from 15 to 60 years old. Now most workers between 15 and 18 years old come here because they didn't have the required level for highschool, I sometimes very low IQ individuals (I know IQ has many issues but it's still useful in my line of work). Basically since 2021 the level every year keeps lowering. You have kids with typical intelligence for their age  and kids who can barely write and count in the same group. Even with helpers it's still awful. Last year in one of the worst group, 80% of the group failed. The worst thing is that the exams keep getting easier and easier. So typical kids come and ask me \"that's it?\". Yeah. That's it. Sorry kid. (The adults are expected to succeed so whatever). But even their level keeps getting lower. We have someone whose job is to help us with mentally challenged kids and god this guy just keep giving us more work for 0 result. \"You just have to do exactly this with your PowerPoint\" Jesus Christ I did it already the guy CAN'T READ. He's never going to be carpenter or a plumber he CAN'T DO MATHS it's not going to happen.\n\nThis is the most frustrating job.\n\nThe other one, I recently had autistic kids coming to my work. We weren't considered an adequate place for them before but apparently it's important for them to be seen and play with other kids. The thing is when they get excited they start screaming which annoys the other kids. I have one that bites kids. One day a mother literally slapped him and cried because she thought I was going to forbid her from coming back (I didn't. The rules are that she should've been expelled but I understood her emotional response but told her not to ever do that again).\nTheir mothers are exhausted and obviously they're using us (I don't blame them at all) to get some rest. But fuck that. I wasn't trained for that and the place isn't made for that. Autistic kids might have been just as happy in specialized places and the other kids wouldn't run in fear when they hear him get too excited. \n\nLast time I thought these jobs just evolved and they were just not meant for me anymore.  But no. I don't care now, I'm good where I am and I'm helping a lot of people and I'm grateful everytime someone gets a new job or a new house with my help. I'm staying. But we need to realize that some places are better for some people.",

      "selftext": "I’m a single mom of three, and earlier this year I made the difficult decision to move back in with my parents to save money and try to get closer to buying a home.\n\nThe move wasn’t ideal. My relationship with my mother has always been strained. She was physically abusive when I was growing up. We were never close, and the same was true for her and my kids. Still, I thought we could manage to coexist peacefully, at least temporarily.\n\nAfter moving in, we only argued once. After that, I stayed out of her way completely. I didn’t cook in the kitchen, didn’t ask her for anything, and focused on my kids and work. I helped her financially, and I also paid rent to my great-aunt, who owns the house. I did more than my share to contribute and keep the peace.\n\nI work full-time, over 40 hours a week, plus a part-time retail job. I also run a small flower business when I can. I’m constantly juggling, but I do it for my kids. They’re well-behaved, kind, and grounded. I’ve never had issues with their behavior.\n\nThen one morning, I came home from grocery shopping and my dad told me she left. Packed up her stuff and walked out, no warning, no goodbye, not even a word to me, my dad or brother, or her grandkids.\n\nNow I’m stuck. My dad is semi-retired and still recovering from a stroke. My brother, who’s in his 30s, has lived at home his whole life and doesn’t contribute enough to cover the bills. If I move out, the house won’t make it financially. But if I stay, I feel like I’m drowning.\n\nAll I want is a peaceful home for my kids. A space where we can breathe. But right now, everything I earn goes to surviving. I’m tired. I don’t have a backup plan. I don’t even really have a moment to think straight.\n\nJust needed to let this out. If anyone’s been through something like this and made it out, I’d love to hear how you did it.\n\n",

      "title": "My ex from a 3+ year relationship was manipulative and abusive, and I didn't know until after we broke up.",
      "selftext": "\nI didn’t see most of what they did clearly at the time, and looking back on it I’m shocked by how naive I was. Some context before we get started: I (20 transman he/him) realized after a lot of reflection that my ex (20 they/them amab) was manipulating me for years, we'll call them B.\n\nTo start off, when me and my ex got together, it was in high school, so from the ages 16, so, already not a great start. What’s worse was it’s during the year we were starting to go back to in-person school rather than online when Covid happened, which was also when my mental health was in the toilet. I had just transferred back to my hometown’s school after dropping out of a STEM program that burned me out. I just got diagnosed with ADD and started anxiety medication so I could function normally, but I was still doing horribly. I was skipping classes, not talking to anyone, being very isolated and depressed. This was when I met B, at my lowest. They would come up to me in the hall on my walks, sit by me in classes we shared, at lunch, and on the bus because we took the same one. We started talking and because I had little connections and just got done with some shitty online relationships, it felt good to be around someone nice in real life.\n\n We got together and started dating the next school year after only two weeks of flirting in multiple shared classes. Things were great. They were basically my first kiss, first make out session, and many other firsts. We snuck around and were lovey with each other whenever we could be at school and at both our homes. I lied to my parents about their parents being home on many occasions so we could be alone, which was very unusual for me as I’m normally very well behaved with my mildly strict parents. We did everything together and spent a lot of time together. As time went on though, the excitement and fun of it all started to wear off. That made room for their more genuine side to come out. Their mood was sometimes unpredictable about things, their boundaries unclear, and communication almost nonexistent at some very crucial points (mainly around my boundaries, sex, or PDA(something I was talked to about by teachers because of how much B clung to me at school)). Boundaries with B were hard to enforce without upsetting them, and hard not to brush off when they were regularly getting broken/ignored by them. It got to a point where I didn’t bother bringing something up because of how they’d react. My “boundaries” became the space I put between us rather than actual respected limits around their behavior. \n\nAs time went on though, even with the usual ups and downs in any relationship, we were doing good and were happy\n\n Even with everything feeling good and loving with them, as time went on, more things started to come to light about how they really acted. They’d joke around and be purposefully immature and stupid around me, but around others, made me out to be the fool. They’d do things that frustrated me, overstimulated me, or upset me more and more, even when I would tell them to stop. B randomly poked fun at me and the things I did, or just straight up making fun of me (ex. “you’re lazy” when I don’t like being very active, “you’re fat” when I would eat a lot (even if it was less than what they ate), or joking to our friends that I would ‘beat/hit’ them in private, which I never did), but most of that was brushed off as jokes by others. These were things I would have asked them to stop multiple times, and they wouldn't. The thing that bothered me in regard to the relationship though was when they’d bring up things I did that hurt/upset them from weeks ago. They brought up things like that all the time; things that they won’t say anything about in the moment or even if I ask about it bothering them. Then all of a sudden, they tell me it hurt their feelings days or weeks later when all I’m able to do is apologize because I didn’t know it had hurt them. I could almost never have an in-depth conversation with them about what happened or how to prevent things in the future like that, or any other issues really. It was like they just shut down, saying “I’ll do better” or “I’ll try harder” and whatever else to end the conversation, and then nothing would change. B would go back to making the same mistakes the next day. I was stuck in a loop. The only reason I never noticed this pattern when I was in it was because these moments would be spaced out around all the good memories of us spending time together.\n\n Time went on and I felt like because of how long we were together; I needed to dedicate myself to them, thinking that this person would ‘be it’ for me. I wanted to put more effort into our communication. I remember a few times when they opened up to me about deeper emotions and how they “Couldn’t imagine life without me”, them telling me about past relationships making them insecure and worried about me leaving them for someone else, someone better. I reassured them otherwise countless times. I wish now that I hadn’t.\n\n As my mental health got better over the years, their mental health got worse. Our dynamics shifted so much, I started feeling less and less comfortable around them because it started to feel like I was babysitting them more than it was a relationship. I noticed many self-destructive habits and even more unpleasant behaviors in them. The incompetence, the messiness, the lack of common sense in some situations, the lack of self-care, the body image and body builder obsession, and still the lack of respect for my boundaries. Every time I brought up something out of concern or affect on our relationship, I got many excuses and even some guilt-tripping and more shutting down. While the pattern was starting to connect for me a bit more, I made excuses for it because of all the reasons they had a bad mental state right now and because of how much I cared for them. It was only with time that I realized that a lot of my care and dedication was part of the manipulation as well.\n\n I remember how close we were and how much information about myself I trusted them with and cringe. I remember admitting with confidence some of my more ‘out-there’ kinks and fantasies, and while they didn’t share most of them, they never minded much. Or so I thought. Time went on and when I would share certain art/fanfiction I really liked that had these more intense topics, they would often look at it in visible disgust and “jokingly” push me away from themselves. They had texted privately a few times too about how some of the things I looked at and reposted on Twitter too, telling me to “never put this on my feed again” but then claimed not to care what I was into or said what they liked was worse. I completely understand not liking certain things in the sense of art and fantasy, and I never pressured them into looking at or reading anything I liked, they were always just so nosy about what I looked at. Multiple times they would forcefully take my phone from me and go into my saved posts to look at them and judge/tease me about them. I always tried to stop them and try to salvage some privacy, but that always made them paranoid about me looking at stuff that would make them feel insecure. The thing is, they never let me see what they had saved in return.\n\n They were so private about their online stuff. Always on discord, always on twitter, never letting me talk to their online friends that they spent so much of their own time and attention on. It all pretty much came to a head after graduation and the summer before I went to college and they went into the military. We had been together for nearly two years at this point. We both had plans for what we wanted to do moving forward, and for it to work, we wouldn’t be able to see each other very much. Here’s where I feel I mess up.\n\n I was so excited for college, I finally got to be my own person with my own people and got out of the house that my parents fought in so much. I got to meet new people! And…oh, what if I meet someone I like? What if someone likes me? I’m polyamorous, I’ve always been able to have feelings for multiple people at once. And since this is such a new situation, I wanted the chance to experience anything at college. Before this realization of mine, because of the distance between B’s and I’s paths, I mentioned taking a break from our relationship. They shot it down immediately. They had a bad experience with someone leaving them for someone else during a break like that and didn’t want to lose me the same way. So, when I brought up the idea of a kind-of break where we are still together and in a committed relationship but leaving room to experiment on the surface level of romance (like kissing or cuddling for physical comfort) they were even more uncomfortable. I explained to them that it wasn’t likely to be anything really intimate, just a chance for me and them to explore while we’re apart, they still didn’t like it. I didn’t know why I was so insistent at the time then, but now I think I was craving that “new relationship” feeling as my time with B had been getting more and more disappointing. It got to a point where we almost broke up because of this conversation. I had mentioned during it that because I’m poly, it was easy for me to get feelings for others even when I still loved them. B had always been very insecure around my loyalty, and I think this was making it worse. I asked them if they would ever have dated me if they knew I was poly, and they said no.\n\nDespite us both being so hurt by the conversation, we came to an agreement that if anything happened (gaining feelings for someone or kissing someone etc.) I would tell them right away and we’d go from there. I still don’t know to this day what that really meant, but I never had to find out. College and friends kept me too busy to think about crushes. During the Fall semester of my first year, B went into basic training. I wasn’t able to contact them outside of writing a letter to them at the base, which I barely had time to think about at school. I had forgotten the app they showed me to use to send them an electronic letter because he showed me months before I even left for college and never mentioned it after that. This mistake would come back to haunt me.\n\n I texted them almost everyday even though they didn’t have access to their phones. They called me when they were allowed to for holidays to say hello and reminded me to send them a letter. By the time I did remember, they were almost at their graduation from Basic. I went on a trip with my mom to be there for it. I didn’t know how much not sending a letter had upset them until they were in tech school. They were hurt that so many of their other friends and family sent them letters but not me. Because I thought I had to hand write and get an envelope and put it in the mail to get it to them, my executive disfunction made it almost impossible to complete. It was one of those things they made me promise to do even when I said I might be too busy; they blamed me for not keeping it. I admit it wasn’t my best moment as a boyfriend, but the amount of time they held it over my head (a whole year afterwards) felt harsh.\n\nAt some point towards the end of my first year, I get a weird message from someone I don’t know from Facebook. The name however is familiar, and when I open it I find out why. It was one of B’s online friends they mentioned. It was a “hey girl” text about B. They told me that if I went to B about this, they were worried B would hurt themselves or worse, and that they just couldn’t let B get away with what they did. Apparently, B was ‘dating’ one of their other friends since our rough patch before college and talking bad about me on their servers and chats. The who, when, and why made sense as I remember B telling me they went to visit this person at that time, and I didn’t doubt B spoke bad about me in other places as they often did it to my face as well (not that it didn’t hurt). But everything else sounded really vague and some of the things they said didn’t add up. It was like they thought B was living with me or something. Either way, even though I knew B had mental problems like anxiety and depression, it wasn’t bad enough for anything like what they were implying, so I went to B and asked about the person who texted me. Immediately I was getting a lot of negative things and stories that spun them as some psycho, but I just listened until B asked why. When they did, I asked him about the person B was cheating on me with (We’ll call them Y). In B’s version of the story, they had reached out to Y when we were in a rough patch because they’re part of their support system atm. They told me about the last time they went to see Y, how things happened between them but they didn't go all the way. That’s what they thought the agreement was from our argument before college. The one where if anything does happen, and you need a comfort of some kind, whatever happens you tell the other person, and we go from there. That one. The one I thought we agreed we were done with because B was too insecure about me meeting other people. The agreement that B broke because I heard about it from someone else MONTHS after it happened, and they went way further than just some kissing and comfort. That they claimed they were going to tell me about when I wasn’t worrying about school. The excuse B gave me was that they were so convinced that I was going to leave them, that it would be easier to just act like we were already broken up and get it over with. Well, I don’t know how, but they managed at the time to guilt me enough to get themselves out of trouble and I let it go.\n\n \n\nWe were both back home for that following summer. Both of us are busy with jobs before the next step on our paths. Both of us were more loyal and dedicated to each other than before. I remember being so burnt out and in need of comfort after a hard first year at school and getting home and being reminded that I was dating someone with the emotional maturity of a toddler. First it was the wisdom teeth, the days of both of us struggling to find a place to take them out as they were “all of a sudden” in a lot of pain and their gums were infected. Driving them the two hours there and back during rush hour and taking them to my parents’ house for the night, as their parents were too busy to be there for them (this was a common occurrence). Taking care of them after that was a struggle too as they were a big baby about the whole thing. I drove them around a lot throughout our relationship as they never went to drivers ed or got their license when they were old enough. If you think it can’t get worse from here, it can.\n\n \n\nB is telling me about their new job and how they’re moving out and into a new apartment with three of their online friends. One of them being Y. I was happy about their new job and finally getting out of their parents’ house for some freedom. I was glad they had friends to be around so it would hopefully help their mental health. So, you can imagine the cruel shock it was that not only were they going to be living with Y, but because it was a three-bedroom apartment, they would be sharing a room with them. And because it’s such a small apartment, they would also be sharing a bed. I expressed my concern about their closeness and previous relationship, but they insisted they didn’t think about them like that and that there was nothing going on between them. I asked if there was any way they would be able to find a different sleeping arrangement, but they always had an excuse. In the end I didn’t know how much further to take the argument, so I just let it go. College was starting soon and this time it was going to make or break us. I was losing hope for us after every unsatisfying argument.\n\n \n\nI knew it was going to be a hard but painless break-up when my mom came to visit, and B was with her as a surprise. I hadn’t told anyone we were doing poorly because it was so complicated and private to me. Not even my roommates who I tell everything. The whole visit was miserable for me. They got on every last one of my nerves, broke every boundary I had, made fun of me so much as a “joke” everyone noticed, and told my best friends/roommates many sexual/embarrassing things that were just between us before. Things that they had told me even they didn’t feel comfortable talking about around others. I was humiliated and stressed the whole time. Me and B spoke about the whole thing for so long, trying to salvage things, or maybe it was just me, I don’t even know at this point. Barely a month after that, we officially went on a break. Every conversation was an argument after their visit; I was so frustrated by how they spoke to me and about me. How many boundaries they were still crossing after all this time. It only took one or two other conversations after the break started for us to end things. By the time we even went on the break, I think I was already done with the relationship. At this point, we were both 19.\n\n \n\nI still to this day don’t know how I let it get that bad before I realized how much they were hurting me. There are even a few other things I could bring up about them that I don’t feel comfortable enough to put in this post because they are too private and sensitive. Nearly a year without them now and I’ve done a lot of healing, but I feel like I still wanted to get the whole story out there. I feel like I need an unbiased opinion about everything that happened.

      "title": "My ex from a 3+ year relationship was manipulative and abusive, and I didn't know until after we broke up.",
      "selftext": ". I didn’t see most of what they did clearly at the time, and looking back on it I’m shocked by how naive I was. Some context before we get started: I (20 transman he/him) realized after a lot of reflection that my ex (20 they/them amab) was manipulating me for years, we'll call them B.\n\nTo start off, when me and my ex got together, it was in high school, so from the ages 16, so, already not a great start. What’s worse was it’s during the year we were starting to go back to in-person school rather than online when Covid happened, which was also when my mental health was in the toilet. I had just transferred back to my hometown’s school after dropping out of a STEM program that burned me out. I just got diagnosed with ADD and started anxiety medication so I could function normally, but I was still doing horribly. I was skipping classes, not talking to anyone, being very isolated and depressed. This was when I met B, at my lowest. They would come up to me in the hall on my walks, sit by me in classes we shared, at lunch, and on the bus because we took the same one. We started talking and because I had little connections and just got done with some shitty online relationships, it felt good to be around someone nice in real life.\n\n We got together and started dating the next school year after only two weeks of flirting in multiple shared classes. Things were great. They were basically my first kiss, first make out session, and many other firsts. We snuck around and were lovey with each other whenever we could be at school and at both our homes. I lied to my parents about their parents being home on many occasions so we could be alone, which was very unusual for me as I’m normally very well behaved with my mildly strict parents. We did everything together and spent a lot of time together. As time went on though, the excitement and fun of it all started to wear off. That made room for their more genuine side to come out. Their mood was sometimes unpredictable about things, their boundaries unclear, and communication almost nonexistent at some very crucial points (mainly around my boundaries, sex, or PDA(something I was talked to about by teachers because of how much B clung to me at school)). Boundaries with B were hard to enforce without upsetting them, and hard not to brush off when they were regularly getting broken/ignored by them. It got to a point where I didn’t bother bringing something up because of how they’d react. My “boundaries” became the space I put between us rather than actual respected limits around their behavior. \n\nAs time went on though, even with the usual ups and downs in any relationship, we were doing good and were happy\n\n Even with everything feeling good and loving with them, as time went on, more things started to come to light about how they really acted. They’d joke around and be purposefully immature and stupid around me, but around others, made me out to be the fool. They’d do things that frustrated me, overstimulated me, or upset me more and more, even when I would tell them to stop. B randomly poked fun at me and the things I did, or just straight up making fun of me (ex. “you’re lazy” when I don’t like being very active, “you’re fat” when I would eat a lot (even if it was less than what they ate), or joking to our friends that I would ‘beat/hit’ them in private, which I never did), but most of that was brushed off as jokes by others. These were things I would have asked them to stop multiple times, and they wouldn't. The thing that bothered me in regard to the relationship though was when they’d bring up things I did that hurt/upset them from weeks ago. They brought up things like that all the time; things that they won’t say anything about in the moment or even if I ask about it bothering them. Then all of a sudden, they tell me it hurt their feelings days or weeks later when all I’m able to do is apologize because I didn’t know it had hurt them. I could almost never have an in-depth conversation with them about what happened or how to prevent things in the future like that, or any other issues really. It was like they just shut down, saying “I’ll do better” or “I’ll try harder” and whatever else to end the conversation, and then nothing would change. B would go back to making the same mistakes the next day. I was stuck in a loop. The only reason I never noticed this pattern when I was in it was because these moments would be spaced out around all the good memories of us spending time together.\n\n Time went on and I felt like because of how long we were together; I needed to dedicate myself to them, thinking that this person would ‘be it’ for me. I wanted to put more effort into our communication. I remember a few times when they opened up to me about deeper emotions and how they “Couldn’t imagine life without me”, them telling me about past relationships making them insecure and worried about me leaving them for someone else, someone better. I reassured them otherwise countless times. I wish now that I hadn’t.\n\n As my mental health got better over the years, their mental health got worse. Our dynamics shifted so much, I started feeling less and less comfortable around them because it started to feel like I was babysitting them more than it was a relationship. I noticed many self-destructive habits and even more unpleasant behaviors in them. The incompetence, the messiness, the lack of common sense in some situations, the lack of self-care, the body image and body builder obsession, and still the lack of respect for my boundaries. Every time I brought up something out of concern or affect on our relationship, I got many excuses and even some guilt-tripping and more shutting down. While the pattern was starting to connect for me a bit more, I made excuses for it because of all the reasons they had a bad mental state right now and because of how much I cared for them. It was only with time that I realized that a lot of my care and dedication was part of the manipulation as well.\n\n I remember how close we were and how much information about myself I trusted them with and cringe. I remember admitting with confidence some of my more ‘out-there’ kinks and fantasies, and while they didn’t share most of them, they never minded much. Or so I thought. Time went on and when I would share certain art/fanfiction I really liked that had these more intense topics, they would often look at it in visible disgust and “jokingly” push me away from themselves. They had texted privately a few times too about how some of the things I looked at and reposted on Twitter too, telling me to “never put this on my feed again” but then claimed not to care what I was into or said what they liked was worse. I completely understand not liking certain things in the sense of art and fantasy, and I never pressured them into looking at or reading anything I liked, they were always just so nosy about what I looked at. Multiple times they would forcefully take my phone from me and go into my saved posts to look at them and judge/tease me about them. I always tried to stop them and try to salvage some privacy, but that always made them paranoid about me looking at stuff that would make them feel insecure. The thing is, they never let me see what they had saved in return.\n\n They were so private about their online stuff. Always on discord, always on twitter, never letting me talk to their online friends that they spent so much of their own time and attention on. It all pretty much came to a head after graduation and the summer before I went to college and they went into the military. We had been together for nearly two years at this point. We both had plans for what we wanted to do moving forward, and for it to work, we wouldn’t be able to see each other very much. Here’s where I feel I mess up.\n\n I was so excited for college, I finally got to be my own person with my own people and got out of the house that my parents fought in so much. I got to meet new people! And…oh, what if I meet someone I like? What if someone likes me? I’m polyamorous, I’ve always been able to have feelings for multiple people at once. And since this is such a new situation, I wanted the chance to experience anything at college. Before this realization of mine, because of the distance between B’s and I’s paths, I mentioned taking a break from our relationship. They shot it down immediately. They had a bad experience with someone leaving them for someone else during a break like that and didn’t want to lose me the same way. So, when I brought up the idea of a kind-of break where we are still together and in a committed relationship but leaving room to experiment on the surface level of romance (like kissing or cuddling for physical comfort) they were even more uncomfortable. I explained to them that it wasn’t likely to be anything really intimate, just a chance for me and them to explore while we’re apart, they still didn’t like it. I didn’t know why I was so insistent at the time then, but now I think I was craving that “new relationship” feeling as my time with B had been getting more and more disappointing. It got to a point where we almost broke up because of this conversation. I had mentioned during it that because I’m poly, it was easy for me to get feelings for others even when I still loved them. B had always been very insecure around my loyalty, and I think this was making it worse. I asked them if they would ever have dated me if they knew I was poly, and they said no.\n\nDespite us both being so hurt by the conversation, we came to an agreement that if anything happened (gaining feelings for someone or kissing someone etc.) I would tell them right away and we’d go from there. I still don’t know to this day what that really meant, but I never had to find out. College and friends kept me too busy to think about crushes. During the Fall semester of my first year, B went into basic training. I wasn’t able to contact them outside of writing a letter to them at the base, which I barely had time to think about at school. I had forgotten the app they showed me to use to send them an electronic letter because he showed me months before I even left for college and never mentioned it after that. This mistake would come back to haunt me.\n\n I texted them almost everyday even though they didn’t have access to their phones. They called me when they were allowed to for holidays to say hello and reminded me to send them a letter. By the time I did remember, they were almost at their graduation from Basic. I went on a trip with my mom to be there for it. I didn’t know how much not sending a letter had upset them until they were in tech school. They were hurt that so many of their other friends and family sent them letters but not me. Because I thought I had to hand write and get an envelope and put it in the mail to get it to them, my executive disfunction made it almost impossible to complete. It was one of those things they made me promise to do even when I said I might be too busy; they blamed me for not keeping it. I admit it wasn’t my best moment as a boyfriend, but the amount of time they held it over my head (a whole year afterwards) felt harsh.\n\nAt some point towards the end of my first year, I get a weird message from someone I don’t know from Facebook. The name however is familiar, and when I open it I find out why. It was one of B’s online friends they mentioned. It was a “hey girl” text about B. They told me that if I went to B about this, they were worried B would hurt themselves or worse, and that they just couldn’t let B get away with what they did. Apparently, B was ‘dating’ one of their other friends since our rough patch before college and talking bad about me on their servers and chats. The who, when, and why made sense as I remember B telling me they went to visit this person at that time, and I didn’t doubt B spoke bad about me in other places as they often did it to my face as well (not that it didn’t hurt). But everything else sounded really vague and some of the things they said didn’t add up. It was like they thought B was living with me or something. Either way, even though I knew B had mental problems like anxiety and depression, it wasn’t bad enough for anything like what they were implying, so I went to B and asked about the person who texted me. Immediately I was getting a lot of negative things and stories that spun them as some psycho, but I just listened until B asked why. When they did, I asked him about the person B was cheating on me with (We’ll call them Y). In B’s version of the story, they had reached out to Y when we were in a rough patch because they’re part of their support system atm. They told me about the last time they went to see Y, how things happened between them but they didn't go all the way. That’s what they thought the agreement was from our argument before college. The one where if anything does happen, and you need a comfort of some kind, whatever happens you tell the other person, and we go from there. That one. The one I thought we agreed we were done with because B was too insecure about me meeting other people. The agreement that B broke because I heard about it from someone else MONTHS after it happened, and they went way further than just some kissing and comfort. That they claimed they were going to tell me about when I wasn’t worrying about school. The excuse B gave me was that they were so convinced that I was going to leave them, that it would be easier to just act like we were already broken up and get it over with. Well, I don’t know how, but they managed at the time to guilt me enough to get themselves out of trouble and I let it go.\n\n \n\nWe were both back home for that following summer. Both of us are busy with jobs before the next step on our paths. Both of us were more loyal and dedicated to each other than before. I remember being so burnt out and in need of comfort after a hard first year at school and getting home and being reminded that I was dating someone with the emotional maturity of a toddler. First it was the wisdom teeth, the days of both of us struggling to find a place to take them out as they were “all of a sudden” in a lot of pain and their gums were infected. Driving them the two hours there and back during rush hour and taking them to my parents’ house for the night, as their parents were too busy to be there for them (this was a common occurrence). Taking care of them after that was a struggle too as they were a big baby about the whole thing. I drove them around a lot throughout our relationship as they never went to drivers ed or got their license when they were old enough. If you think it can’t get worse from here, it can.\n\n \n\nB is telling me about their new job and how they’re moving out and into a new apartment with three of their online friends. One of them being Y. I was happy about their new job and finally getting out of their parents’ house for some freedom. I was glad they had friends to be around so it would hopefully help their mental health. So, you can imagine the cruel shock it was that not only were they going to be living with Y, but because it was a three-bedroom apartment, they would be sharing a room with them. And because it’s such a small apartment, they would also be sharing a bed. I expressed my concern about their closeness and previous relationship, but they insisted they didn’t think about them like that and that there was nothing going on between them. I asked if there was any way they would be able to find a different sleeping arrangement, but they always had an excuse. In the end I didn’t know how much further to take the argument, so I just let it go. College was starting soon and this time it was going to make or break us. I was losing hope for us after every unsatisfying argument.\n\n \n\nI knew it was going to be a hard but painless break-up when my mom came to visit, and B was with her as a surprise. I hadn’t told anyone we were doing poorly because it was so complicated and private to me. Not even my roommates who I tell everything. The whole visit was miserable for me. They got on every last one of my nerves, broke every boundary I had, made fun of me so much as a “joke” everyone noticed, and told my best friends/roommates many sexual/embarrassing things that were just between us before. Things that they had told me even they didn’t feel comfortable talking about around others. I was humiliated and stressed the whole time. Me and B spoke about the whole thing for so long, trying to salvage things, or maybe it was just me, I don’t even know at this point. Barely a month after that, we officially went on a break. Every conversation was an argument after their visit; I was so frustrated by how they spoke to me and about me. How many boundaries they were still crossing after all this time. It only took one or two other conversations after the break started for us to end things. By the time we even went on the break, I think I was already done with the relationship. At this point, we were both 19.\n\n \n\nI still to this day don’t know how I let it get that bad before I realized how much they were hurting me. There are even a few other things I could bring up about them that I don’t feel comfortable enough to put in this post because they are too private and sensitive. Nearly a year without them now and I’ve done a lot of healing, but I feel like I still wanted to get the whole story out there. I feel like I need an unbiased opinion about everything that happened. Sorry this is so fucking long, I think the details are important.\n\n",

      "selftext": "First time poster, long time reader. Never thought I’d actually have to post here, but here we are.\n\nSo… I booked an Airbnb back in May for my wedding in July. Everything was perfect until about 30 minutes before we were supposed to leave, when the host called and said there was “drama with the town” and that if anyone asked, we should say we were friends, not renters. At that point, I had zero choice. We were literally getting ready, and the place was for my husband, his family visiting from Italy and his parents. So we agreed to keep things quiet.\n\nAfter my wedding, I was on such a high. It was the best weekend ever. The host had left a beautiful welcome package, everything looked great, and since we didn’t know there would be any negative fallout, I left a positive, honest review. It was also my first Airbnb booking, and I just wanted to be a good guest and get a good review in return.\n\nOn the wedding day, someone from the town actually came by to check, and we went along with the story because we couldn’t risk getting kicked out while everyone was getting ready. Fast forward to the end of August. My father-in-law and brother-in-law both get violation tickets in the mail with fines and court dates for “renting” the property. Except neither of them even booked it. The town fined them because their cars were parked in the driveway. Like, what?!\n\nI called Airbnb immediately. They said, “Don’t worry, we’ll handle it,” and escalated the case to a “special team” on September 4th. Since then? Crickets. I’ve called multiple times and only get automated replies or vague copy-and-paste messages. No updates, no help, nothing.\n\nThe court date was set for tomorrow, so we had no choice but to just pay the fines since it would have been over a two-hour drive each way for everyone involved.\n\nNow I want Airbnb to reimburse us. The host clearly broke the rules, Airbnb told me they’d handle it, and now we’re the ones out hundreds of dollars and dealing with the stress.\n\nHas anyone gone through something similar? Is there any way to actually hold Airbnb responsible or take legal action for this kind of thing?\n\nThanks in advance. I honestly can’t believe this is real life.",

I'm starting to feel better but its still stuff I just cant bring myself to do. I feel sick reading our old messages and I havent said or typed their name since it happened, still dont know when I will be able to.\n\nOne of our mutual friends have always had mental health issues for as long as Ive known her (lil over a year) and while shes a great friend, Ive always been put in the role of having to comfort and balance sinking ships in every close friend group ive ever had. Ive been fielding other peoples suicide threats since I was 13. Im so tired of it. It feels like everything I do is just about sitting in a row boat filling with water and throwing bucket fulls back into the occean as it keeps sinking. I dont know why I keep getting put in this situation time and time again. Is my head broken or something? why cant I make normal friends that I dont have to convince to stay alive?? Im trying my best to help my friend, I know she cant help it, I know what she needs most rn is reassurance that our friendship isnt gonna end just cause L died. Im trying so hard to put her needs over my own. But how can you help a person that wants you to save them yet refuses to do anything that would help?\n\nIm a positive person, kinda have to be to not implode, but I dont have any place to grieve cause im stuck being everyones rock. I cant tell anyone about how I feel. My friend acts like shes the first person to ever struggle, like im stupid for relating or trying to come up with solutions. It feels like she doesnt see me as a full person. Like Im a snowglobe to shake for external validation and trivia. I feel awful having to always be so supportive, I want to be able to joke about things that suck, I want to be able to tease without worrying that it will cause someone to spiral, I want to be able to comfort someone without having to watch my every word for things that could bring on a sucidal episode. I want to be able to end friendships that are bad for me instead of dragging them along forever. it would be so much easier than trying to support someone that refuses to belive anything good you tell them. I dont want to have my trauma dragged out as a comfort tool for other people.\n\nim so angry and im so sad, and Im not allowed to be either infront of other people.",

      "selftext": "I’m 21 and diagnosed with co-morbid anxiety/depression by a licensed psychiatrist. As a kid up until now, I’ve never had any irl friends due to my own insecurities around my personality. I’ve always struggled with my mental health since being a young child with daily suicidal ideation.\n\nA few years ago, my mom developed an affliction in her legs that makes every day tasks extremely challenging. She still works, but relies on me to help her in the bathroom, get showered, dressed, and daily medical treatments. My brother helps with the driving. I am still learning how. She relies on both of us for food, but we end up ordering in most nights since I struggle to cook with my depression and still trying to learn how through YouTube. I quit my part time job as it was draining for me to clock off work and take care of my mom right after; it also made it more difficult on my brother to keep driving me. I don’t have the financial means to move out.\n\nI spend every day at home unless we go out for my mom’s stuff, to pick up food, or to get groceries. Idk how to talk to people without coming across as awkward or accidentally rude. I get annoyed easily, can’t hold a conversation to save my life, and take things too personally. I feel pressured by everyone to take care of my mom when I can hardly take care of myself. She’s done so much for me, but I can’t keep doing it. The same family that say I should be doing more to help my mom only visit when THEY need my mom’s help. I’m the one they look at when they see the house is a mess or nothing has been cooked. I’m the one they think should be taking care of my mom full-time. I’m the one they see as a failure of a daughter.\n\nI’m overwhelmed. My suicidal ideation has been more persistent than ever. I don’t know what happiness feels like. The only thing that’s kept me alive is the hope that I’ll have people to connect with and find community in the future. That’s all that’s kept me going, but I’m losing hope. I rarely cry in front of people. Today, I broke down after helping my mom in the bathroom and said that I can’t do this anymore. I said I am tired. She’s resentful that I don’t want to help her anymore. I’m just tired. I have no one and I am tired",

I (18f) found a good little group of friends in college and more people have joined, like my roommate and her friend, and I am so glad to have met them. I am 5 hours from my hometown, and I struggle to make friends because of my social anxiety and such. As people have gotten closer in our group, I've been feeling more and more isolated. Two people in the group just started dating, two other people are like sibling level close already, then the few others I feel like are closer with other people in the group than me. I don't think they are trying to hurt me, but I feel like an outsider right now. I don't really have any other close friends and my close friends from high school are 6-12 hrs away. I don't want to talk to my friends here because I don't want them to feel bad since they are all so happy. I feel invisible, isolated, or like they'd rather be anywhere else than me around me. I've been feeling like this more and more over the last few weeks, but I don't even know how to stop feeling this way. Sorry for this load dump lol but thanks for reading this confession.",

      "title": "I reported my mom to cps during her divorce and now she might lose custody",
      "selftext": "I (15F) lived with my parents and siblings (12F and 6M) until a week ago when my Dad officially moved into a new house (he moved out about 2 weeks ago). My mom and dad BOTH work full time jobs. My mom privately told me she was divorcing my dad in July the night after she told him. She told me that she was deciding to file for divorce because my dad was “verbally abusive” and if she wasn’t with him anymore, she would be a better mom. She then clarified that she’s been using “unhealthy coping mechanisms” and leaving my dad would help them go away.\nThe thing is, I’m pretty sure she is an alcoholic. Almost every two to three days on vacation she gets drunk (and around 2 days a week not on vacation) takes out her anger on my siblings and me. While she’s never been physically abusive when intoxicated she would yell, make accusations, and refuse to do parental duties like: making us food, putting my brother in bed, cleaning the house, or just being nice. My dad helps with these things when needed, but my mom gets mad when he does because he’s “making her feel bad”. She has had this problem for over 10 years now. \nSince the divorce was announced to the rest of the family, my mom has “let loose” a lot more. She goes out with friends, mainly Ella and Brit, invites them over, and always comes back or ends up drunk. This is now every weekend and some weekdays and she still drinks during the week, just not as heavily.\n\nNow recently, she has been involving my siblings and I. Late July, we went out as a family for dinner and she got so wasted that I had to drive home my mother and grandparents while my dad drove my siblings home separately. My mom climbed out of her seat and grabbed the wheel several times, driving us into oncoming traffic and almost causing an accident. She yelled at me for being a disrespectful bitch and that I’m such a little shit for taking her car, and acting entitled for not letting her drive when she made me pull over. She also damaged the side of my car another time. This is just one example. I have my permit so it is normally fine to drive as long as a sober adult is in the passenger seat.\nSo to the actual recent story which happened about 2 weeks ago:\nMy mom invited Ella and her kids (9F and 6M) and Britt over while my dad and sister were gone. They each drank at least one glass of wine and several wine bottles were on the table. Then my mom said we should go get dinner and I offered to drive. My logic for driving is this: if my mom drives her car there then she will want to drive home even if intoxicated and I won’t be able to stop her. If I drive she will expect me to drive home and won’t push to drive herself. I know it’s not perfect because it doesn’t hold her accountable and lets her have a DD but I’d rather that than get in an accident.\nSo we get there, she drinks a lot more meanwhile I have to sit in a table separate from the adults and watch Ella’s kids and my brother. Ella’s son who is my brothers friend was acting out of control- pulling his pants down and making his sister and my brother look, thrusting into my brother’s back, and yelling at me. His mom did nothing about this. The sister cried and felt scared about how he was being and her mom just waved her off.\nAfter 2 hours of this hell and 30 minutes after the restaurant closed my mom got the check and I was able to grab my brother and get to the car. Mom and Britt staggered to the car and Ella and her kids went home separately. I drove us home as my mom yelled and criticized me. We got home and my mom and Britt immediately went into mom’s room and shut the door. I bathed my brother and he had to sleep in my bed as he had no sheets on his bed.\nI went to my dad’s house the next day because I couldn’t look at my mom. Day after that I went to therapy old my therapist who told me it was illegal to drive without a sober adult and that it was reckless endangerment and can be classified as neglect. She told me as a mandatory reporter she had to tell someone. \nTwo days later someone from cps pulled me out of class and took a statement about what happened. She told me they would likely put in place a weekly alcohol test or put her in therapy/rehab. This is where I’m worried I’m in the wrong… they asked if I thought family therapy would work and I said no way, we did it before and it didn’t change anything. I told them how many times my mom promised she would never put me in that position again but did anyway, and cried about how it’s like she’s not even the same person. I had to make her understand that this is a big problem. I live in USA and I know the system often doesn’t work well.\nThat day my mom picked me up and the way home she confronted me about reporting her as she got a phone call. She was calm but visibly fuming. She told me “I never want you to be in that position and I’m sorry… but I also DONT want to lose my kids! Do you understand me??” She said many other things that made me doubt if she even had a problem at all.\nSo; with the authorities involved, I’m sure something is going to happen. But I’m also worried that with my parents divorce still not finalized and my parents living separately now and my mom’s allegations of verbal abuse about my dad im worried something very bad will happen. What do I do, am I wrong for not lying to the cps person, should I have not told my therapist? My mom promised it won’t happen again but I just don’t believe her.",

He told me that if I wanted to do any side hustle, he could arrange something. Since I was interested, he told me to meet him at a nearby railway station later that day with my CV.\n\nI went there that evening with my CV. We sat near the entrance of the station, which was less crowded and dark. He told me he had a job where I'd have to message some old man, and along with the messages, I'd have to provide additional sexual support. When I asked more, he said something I don't remember clearly, but then he ended up touching my penis and asked if I was liking it. My head went blank. I couldn't believe what was happening. Then he told me to touch his penis. I couldn't scream. I didn't touch him, I ran. He followed me to the station, but since there were people around, he couldn't do anything more. He bought me some eatables from a station shop and waited with\n\nme until I took the next local train home.\n\nEven now, when I look back, I realize I was an obvious target for people like that. On trains too, uncles would touch me inappropriately. If that happened just 2-3 years later, those men would've been beaten to pulp by me. But back then, I was a college student in a new city, and I couldn't do much.\n\nI respect everyone's sexual preference, do what you like, with whom you like. But without consent, it becomes trauma for the other person. You never know how many sleepless nights that person might go through and more.",

      "title": "I tried to find Pokemon cards for my son’s birthday. I learned just how awful that experience can be.",
      "selftext": "My son and daughter have been into Pokemon for the last year. It started with a few cards I had picked up at Goodwill that were bent or torn that they found in my box of random things. They created their own way of playing and had a lot of fun. I’d played Pokemon Go a few years previous, but had never done the card game. I knew a little about collecting but hadn’t known just how bad things had become. \n\nWe started playing Pokemon Go together and had a lot of fun going on walks and talking about our favorite Pokemon. I was able to recover my old account and helped them create their own. Eventually they talked with friends at school and began wanting to get their own cards. I had seen large quantities of cards on eBay. We paid $30 and got a box of 1000 cards for them to share and go through, all cheap cards but they had hours of fun sorting through and creating their own collections. \n\nAfter doing this a few times over the months their binders were overflowing. So we moved into looking less for quantity and wanted to go for quality. This was about two months before my son’s birthday. We had been watching some pack opening videos on Tik-Tok and started watching Coop’s Collection on YouTube. My son was interested in getting some packs of cards to open on his own like in the videos. \n\nI started to do some casual looking over the next several weeks and found out just how difficult that task would be. I didn’t want to buy from a scalper at 3x the price as money is tight like most households these days, so I started to look into what stores sold them. In the month before his birthday I visited Walmart, Target, Best Buy, GameStop, Costco, found out about Pokemon vending machines at Fry’s, Safeway, Winco, and even cards being sold at Cracker Barrel. I visited dozens of stores, watched hours of videos, joined several discord groups, all trying to get my son his birthday present. I had trouble since I’m currently working two jobs, but would stop whenever I was near somewhere that had them. \n\nTwo weeks before his birthday I found out the Pokemon Center online store had just opened for taking preorders for a new set coming out. I hopped over to the site, and was in the queue to enter. After 2 hours of sitting in the virtual line, I finally entered and boxes were available. I added 2 to my cart, went to check out and hit submit on my order. I was met with the message, “Hello, Trainer! We're completing some maintenance right now, so please check back later,” followed by “Access denied Error 17. What happened?\nThis request was blocked by our security service.” My IP had been flagged and blocked as a bot account for using Apple Safari to place my order (at least from what I found online). I attempted to re-enter multiple times from multiple devices and was met with the same until finally I got in on a laptop and found out there was no more stock available. I tried submitting a CS ticket, but was told in the end “tough luck.”\n\nI had finally had enough and decided I needed to take a few days off work before his birthday to try to track something down. I received alerts about stores restocking but showed up to empty shelves. The day before his birthday I hit up 7 locations that were getting restocked and was told there was nothing available. I tried all the tricks, to no avail. I even messaged a few scalpers selling packs, but was met with them being out of stock as well. \n\nFinally morning of his birthday I decided to get up at 5 and hit everywhere I could before he woke up. I hit several locations with vending machines, but there was nothing. Finally I was going to hit Walmart, Target, and GameStop by 10am. On my way to Walmart I drove past Target (not open yet) and there was a line going around the side of the building. I drove past GameStop and again there was an enormous line. I had nearly given up but decided to hit Walmart before I resolved to give up. Alone on the shelf was a single League Battle Deck of Gardevoir EX it came with a few packs to open and one of his favorites, Greninja. I grabbed it and a plush of his favorite Pokemon and ran home to be with him on his birthday. \n\nAll of this to say that finding Pokemon was nearly a full time job. I learned a lot, but part of me is hoping this phase will soon pass and my kids will move onto something else. It’s pretty awful what this children’s game has become. I am currently on the lookout for more cards in preparation for Christmas. I’m hoping 3 months lead will give me enough time to find a bit more for both of them, but I’m not holding out much hope nor putting in the time I did this time. ",

My dad sexually abused me when I was younger. My mom didn’t believe me for years she always painted him as the “perfect husband.” Only when she found out he was cheating on her did she start treating me more like a daughter. Even now she still guilt-trips me about smoking, drinking or going out instead of ever acknowledging the damage that was done to me.\n\nI moved to Bengaluru 4 years back  to try to build a life of my own. I’ve been in therapy, which has helped, but my therapist isn’t available this week and I’m in a really dark place. My parents recently came to visit and during that visit my dad told me his birthday is on the xx’th of this month. Now he’s pressuring me to drop everything, go back to Kerala and celebrate it with him.\n\nI’m already struggling here. I’m looking for a place to live but can’t find anything. I feel completely stuck.\n\nI started smoking and drinking to survive the pain. Without it, honestly, I don’t know if I’d still be here. I’m not proud of it, but right now it’s the only thing keeping me going day to day. Please don’t tell me to “just quit” I know it’s bad, I know the risks, but it’s what’s helping me stay alive until I have another option.\n\nI don’t have a safe home. I don’t have other family to run to. I have a few friends but even those friendships sometimes feel like people are drifting away or using me.\n\nI feel like the world would be better off without me. But a small part of me still wants to live, heal and find real care. I’m holding on to that tiny bit of hope and that’s why I’m writing this.\n\nI don’t know what to do about my dad’s birthday. Should I go? Should I stay away? Should I run? I’m so lost. If you’ve been through anything like this, please tell me how you coped, or just leave a kind word. I’m trying to stay afloat.\n\n(Please, no harsh judgment about my coping methods…I’m just trying to survive right now.)",

      "selftext": "Dear you,\n\nI’m not sure how to start this. These past few weeks have been some of the hardest of my life. I am completely shattered. I’m so deeply hurt that you would do something like this to me after everything I’ve already gone through, and after everything we have been through together. We’ve faced so many misunderstandings that I thought would make us stronger, not break us apart.\n\nAs I told you before, I’ve been feeling like we’re strangers lately, like we don’t know each other anymore. I miss going out on dates. I miss the effort. I miss the early days of our relationship when everything felt easy and full of love. I can’t even put into words how much you mean to me, or how sad I am that we’ve come to this, that we can’t trust each other, that you couldn’t give me the decency of honesty.\n\nIf only you had told me instead of me having to find out on my own, things could’ve been so different. I would have had no issue starting over, I would have done it in a heartbeat. But instead, you lied to me throughout our entire relationship. You hid things from me that, as your partner, I had the right to know. Having to discover it myself was so much harder. I can’t help but wonder, would you have ever told me? Would we have gotten married, had kids, built the life we dreamed of? Would you have kept deceiving me? Would you have stopped? Or would you have ended up physically cheating?\n\nYou were my best friend. You were supposed to be the love of my life. How could you do this to me? I have given up so much and would’ve given my entire life for you, and this is how you repay me? I’m so angry with you. I’m disgusted. I’m heartbroken that you could look me in the eyes and tell me you loved me while doing all of this behind my back. Why did you have to be so selfish? Why didn’t I deserve the same honesty you always asked from me? Am I not good enough? Am I not what you wanted? How long were you planning to drag me along? Was I just a placeholder until you found someone better? Is that why you downloaded so many dating apps?\n\nIf I wasn’t enough for you, why date me at all? Why let me fall in love with your family and your world only to take it all away in such an awful way? From the very beginning, I told you cheating was something I would never tolerate. I come from a broken home, and I wanted to do better, to be better for my future children. You could’ve broken up with me. You could’ve let me go. But instead, you kept me around like a safety net until something better came along.\n\nI’m so mad at you, I can barely find the words. I loved you so much. I know I said I needed space, and I do. There’s nothing I would want more than to pretend this never happened and continue planning our future. But my heart can’t comprehend how you thought it was okay to do this to me. Right now, I can’t. I can’t continue living with lies. I can’t even look at you without flashing back to the moment everything fell apart.\n\nAnd what hurts even more is knowing that now, suddenly, you say you want to change. You say you’ll do whatever it takes to fix things, to be better, to rebuild trust. But why did it take you losing me for you to finally want to make the change I’ve been asking for all along? Why did it take breaking my heart for you to realize everything I’ve been trying to tell you for so long?\n\nI really hope you find what you’re looking for. I hope you can be happy someday and see yourself in the same light I used to. I hope you take the time to truly work on yourself and face what led you here, not for me, but for your own sake. You owe that to yourself.\n\nNow all of that is gone. Everything we built was built on a lie, and it hurts so much. My heart physically hurts for us, for our dreams. I’ve met so many people because of you, people I care about deeply, and losing them is almost as painful as losing you. I don’t only have to grieve you, your family, but I get to grieve our late nights talking about getting a farm, having kids, living the life we dreamed of. Letting go of those dreams is breaking me just as much as letting go of you.\n\nMaybe in another life, we did everything right. Maybe we’ll meet again, maybe we’ll meet later in life and if we are both in the same place we can give it another go, but for now I do have to say goodbye for my own sake. I do have to put myself first. I deserve peace, honestly, and the kind of love that doesn’t wait, the kind of love that treats me right from the start.\n\nI wish I hated you, but part of me will always love you. Goodbye.\n\nForever and always,\nSomeone who loved you deeply",

      "selftext": "I want to start by saying I'm not a native speaker, so please be patient with me.\n\nFor context, I (15m) used to go to drum classes every wednesday. I studied pretty near my house so I went alone most of the time, which I didn't mind considering I'm not allowed to walk alone most of the time thanks to my past mental issues, from which I'm still recovering. This was around March of this year. \n\nMy teacher (I have no idea what his age is, sorry) sort of began 'flirting' with me around two months in, kissing my hand, calling me pretty and such. I was pretty oblivious to it until he kissed my hand and once offered me a ride home. I didn't really know what to do, I did enjoy the attention of being loved and cared for so I tried flirting back, calling him pretty and such. I believe it might be worth mentioning I'm a trans male, I haven't done any noticeable changes so I still look pretty female and still dress pretty femininely since I really like fashion. We continued flirting and he asked me to add his number and to \"not tell anyone\" and for some reason I didn't notice how creepy this was up until way later. We started dating a little later.\n\nSince this point, my memory has become quite blurry, I don't quite remember everything but I'll say what I know. In this point he started getting really touchy, which I mistook for simply being affectionate. However, he got really inappropriate fast and all I remember is him unzipping his pants. Most of the days I spent with him I forgot about quickly, and one class I believe I got some sort of anxiety attack as he was touching me. I asked him to stop and I remember he didn't, asking if I loved him and stuff like that. Once I left I didn't tell anyone until next week, when I told my parents he touched my thigh last class and left it at that, since I'm still embarrassed to tell them anything else I remember. \n\nI don't want to diagnose myself or anything but I believe I got pretty 'traumatised' (I don't know if that would be a correct word here) due to this event. Anytime I even remotely feel a scent similar to his I get anxiety or even panic attacks, which is horrible because there's a kid in my classroom who wears a really similar perfume to his. I'm glad I left, but at the same time, I'm worried about running into him again.\n\nSmall Update: I told my mom a while ago (about the thigh touching only)  and she did tell the owners of the school, but they apparently haven't done anything since we've seen his bike parked at the school's entrance. Also, I managed to remember some stuff, like he told me our dynamics really reminded him of Lolita and Leon the professional, he'd make dedicated WhatsApp statuses for me with songs and certain poems, he once got really upset at me for not telling him why I hadn't gone for two classes straight and also told me he'd not only try to get me gifts in exchange for my silence but also get us to meet somewhere else where he could \"have me all to himself\". It's not much, I'm really sorry, but I've been whacking my brain to try and remember as much as I possibly can. I'm still trying to get the courage to tell my parents and psychologist the full story, so anything that may help is deeply appreciated. Also, please don't lecture me about my gender identity, it's a waste of time on both ends. ",

      "selftext": "My boyfriend and I have been together for 5.5 years now. I love him so much, but i know deep down i hate him.\n\nWhen we first started seeing eachother/dating i thought he was secretly gay, sleeping with other women, or asexual because he RARELY slept with me since Day 1. A couple months into dating, we were travelling and cottaging with friends, and I had a serious talk with him about not wanting to move forward in the relationship if we’re going to end up in a sexless dead bedroom. He told me he will work on it but he just isn’t a sexual person nor did he ever have a high sex drive (barely a sex drive at all).\n\nFast forward through the years, we both weren’t perfect. For example, he ran his first half marathon and I was coming to meet him at the end of it, but despite me leaving an hour early to get to the end point, I still missed the end because the traffic was insane.\n\n4 years into our relationship, I noticed he started acting weird around me. He would flinch and move his phone when I walked by him, turning it away. Things like that. In 4 years I had never checked his phone once. Fully accepted that we have no sex life and thought he was the “family man” he claimed to be. One night, because of his odd behaviour and my gut feeling telling me to do so, I checked his laptop after he fell asleep while we watched movies in bed on it.\n\nI went to type in Instagram, but fetlife came up. I didn’t know what fetlife was so I went to the webpage. Turns out it’s a fet!sh website, and his login was saved. I saw his messages and sexts with women from age 20 to 69. Months long conversations over 3 years during our relationship. I looked on his saved passwords, found passwords saved for seeking arrangements, tinder, everything. I closed his laptop at 3am and went to stay at my friends place. He immediately woke up and spam called me.\n\nTo get me to come back and regain my trust he gave me the passwords to all his devices. The next night he fell asleep and I looked at his phone for the first time. I put my Face ID into his phone and redownloaded Snapchat and tinder and everything I could think of. On his Snapchat I found a relationship with some nurse (he’s a surgeon) that he had during our relationship and she was still emailing him until I saw all of this. They had sexts, swapped nude pics, exchanged gifts. EVERYTHING. His Snapchat had 30+ women, saved with various names like “Hot Blonde Free Smoothie”. Lots of sexual conversations, even him asking a girl if she wants him to sleep with him while we’re travelling and I’m sleeping beside him at 7am. He matched with my sisters friends on tinder and had weeks long conversations with them (that they screenshotted and sent to me). When I asked him if he had ever gone on tinder or bumble, he said no (not knowing that I had physical proof)\n\nHis best friend he went to Columbia with had texts sharing that my bf was about to sleep with some girl there but felt “too bad” to go through with it, asking him to sub in.\n\nIt hurts to know he has withheld a sex life from me and told me that he has a very low sex drive, but has cheated on me for almost our entire relationship with multiple women and having a crippling porn addiction. \n\nI’ve tried breaking up but he has been better and says he wants to be better so now I’m stuck in this limbo of hating our relationship and wanting to leave but also needing to stay because I have nothing without him. I don’t have a place to go, no family to live with, and no money as I just finished schooling and looking to start my career. Anyways, just wanted to say, I’m in a relationship that I feel I’m stuck in and I hate him for what he did.",

We lived together as roommates for 5 years, we worked together for about 3, and to this day we meet up every other week or so for board games.\n\nHe's worked in his family's business for his entire working career, and every year the family does a sort of camping trip. This has extended beyond just the family and their employees - routinely they invite friends, I've been twice myself. The trip was cancelled for a few years in a row, but they picked it back up and did it again a few weeks ago... and I didn't get an invitation.\n\nWe're close enough that I felt comfortable asking him about it, and his rationale made sense. \"It came together quickly\", he told me. \"It was mostly people from work\", yeah that makes sense. I took him at face value and let it go, no big deal.\n\nThen last night, I saw a few of our mutual friends, guys who don't come around as much. They talked about the trip and how fun it had been. Now I don't know what to think. I thought this was one of my best friends and suddenly it doesn't seem like that goes both ways. He would've had to go out of his way to reach out to these guys, it was a thoughtful decision to include them. Which can only mean that it was a thoughtful decision to *exclude* me.",

I had no friends in my university and felt marginalized by my fellow students. For two years, I was all alone all the time and suffered a lot from this situation. It was very hard for me. My mental health had been bad for a long time, but it completely plummeted the last two years. I even thought of ending it a few times.\n\nBut since I arrived to Sweden, I feel so good. Granted, I was doing better the last 3 months before leaving, but I genuinely feel happy now. \nSwedish persons are so nice and considerate. I was alone all the time in my country and now I'm having lunch and dinner with friends. I'm also getting invited in study groups. To most people, it's nothing. But for me, it's unusual.\n It feels so nice to be appreciated. It really brings out the best in me. Thank you Sweden.\n\n\nThat's it, that's the post. Am happy.",

      "selftext": "Non native speaker and not based in the US. \n\nHi, I'm writing here cause I'm doing a training internship in which I'm mostly doing nothing. \nI'll explain myself better.\n\nI need to do this internship, or stage, because it's required for my degree. It's unpaid and just related to college, no opening to be hired after. \n\nWhile I'm extremely grateful for the opportunity, the experience has become increasingly difficult in my daily life. \n\nThe problem is that most days there's very little for me to do. I spend hours sitting in the office doing nothing, while everyone else is busy. Since it's for university, I'm not expected to work or help with the workload, which I appreciate because sometimes people take advantage of interns. However, being left alone without guidance or tasks makes me feel useless. I lack the knowledge or resources to contribute and the staff doesn't really have the time to teach me (knowing I won't work here after). \n\nI had hoped to propose to my supervisors/tutors the chance of doing the remaining hours from home. I can read relevant materials and write reports about it to show I'm doing something, and only come to the office when there are activities I can actually participate in. \n\nWhen I brought up something similar a few months ago, I was told \"it's normal to have nothing to do sometimes. Learning to be patient is important.\" While I understand that, time has passed and little has changed, and I think my time is worth more than just waiting around. However I'm afraid to raise the issue again because I don't want to come across as annoying. \n\nI'm diagnosed as AuDHD, but haven't disclosed because I don't think it's relevant. But maybe that's the reason why it's taking such a big toll on me. I don't know how to talk to \"colleagues\" (I mean, I don't really work here, but I don't know how to call them) without worrying I'll seem awkward or annoying, even though everyone is always nice to me. The combination of office noises, boredom and lack of engagement has had a real impact on my health, to the point I skip meals or cry from frustration once I get home. I've already had to take a few days off due to burnout, and I honestly feel like I'm near my limit agains. It's incredibly embarrassing to feel this way when people have burnout for the opposite reasons.\n\nI'm also afraid of coming as ungrateful. I need this internship to graduate. And the place is nice, the people kind. But it's clear they don't have the time to tutor me because they have tons of work to do. There's no one to blame, of course. I feel useless and uncomfortable because people notice I'm dong nothing, but I can't really do anything if they don't tell me what to do!! It's not like I can take initiative. Even because when I tried, I was told \"not now, I've other things to do\" or my efforts didn't lead to anything. \n\nAt this point all I can do is keep showing up, spend time scrolling Reddit, trying to read books useful for my academic career, and wait for the rare moments when there's something I can actually take part in, which sometimes only amounts to a couple of hours per week. \n\nAgain, I know no one is at fault, and the supervisors have been my saviours because it's hard to find places for these kind of stage. \nAt the same time, I'm really frustrated and wanted to get this off my chest while sitting here at \"work\", once again without anything to do. \n\nThanks for reading my words. \n\nSmall silly update (same day): one of the tutors didn't noticed I was there today, because I was incredible silent and actually didn't ask or show myself in their office. My problem still stays, but things would be better if I didn't feel like a bother to the world and if I didn't do anything for the fear of annoy people. I guess that's therapy material?? (Laughing not to cry)\n\nOther small update (13/10/25): I decided that the best thing would be telling them I'm autistic. So I did it. They were supportive and we should be able to adjust my stage activities taking my condition into account. I'm so relieved! ",

      "selftext": "Had a massive heart attack, and now I feel my life is over\n\nA week ago, I suffered a major Heart attack, and was without a pulse for 5 minutes. The police who responded performed CPR and brought me back. I was in the middle of nowhere and had to get a life flight helicopter ride to a hospital, 130 miles away in Utah. I have been at this hospital for over a week now, and have undergone many tests, drugs, and procedures. \n\nUnfortunately, 3 months ago, I was let go from my work, and haven't been able to find a new job in time, so I am without insurance. My wonderful friends and family started a gofundme, but it's barely a grain of sand to what my bill will be. Those close to me have told me not to worry, as I can be approved for medicaid or financial assistance through charities and fundraising with the hospital, but when applying, they look at assets, and I have money in the stock market. Nothing crazy, but enough to be noticed. That has been the only money I have in hopes for a somewhat bright future, and not only do I feel it will deny me necessary financial assistance, but I feel the hospital could go after it, dousing any hope I had for its growth. \n\nI have been under unemployment for these 3 months, and have a smaller resevoir in checkings, but this goes towards paying the bills and rent. I have since racked up credit card debt trying to keep up with food and life necessities, and have a large loan still on the car I got last year after having my previous car totalled. \n\nI am in a position where it's so daunting, I feel my brain is trying to disconnect me from reality. The hospital now wants me to wear a defibrillator vest for 3 months, attend visits with physical therapists, have appointments with cardiologists, and be on a bunch of medications, and I have no way to pay for it all. I am ready to make sacrifices, such as downgrading my vehicle and selling belongings, but no matter what I lose or change, it won't make a dent in what this debt will be overall, even if I sell all of my stocks. And even then, I will still have to pay taxes on all of that next year.\n\nIt's an ominous shadow creeping up behind me, and I don't know what to do.",

      "selftext": "\nSo since everyone is sharing something about their friends and their families actions, i felt obligated to do the same, so i have been dealing about this situation for a while now, i am almost ready to get over it but i need your advice or thoughts about how i have been acting in this situation and what i should have done differently I am a 21M I am from Erbil, and i speak fluent English, Arabic and Kurdish (of course, my native language and all) so lets begin.\n\nSo i have this friend of mine from Baghdad, he moved here in 2014, at age 9. We have been friends since 7th grade (he was 12 and i was freshly 13, it was September 2017) We were inseparable, our whole group was Our families knew each other We went out every single weekend We travelled abroad together, if the group wasn’t going out, he would call me to just hang out with me, his whole family knew me and trusted me deeply (they still do), although years ago as teens, i would hear things about him like “he is jealous of you, of how popular and athletically talented you are, but above all he is jealous of your personality” he saw me at my worst and at my best, yes, we were that close, it all started last summer, he was getting ready to get into uni, i was already enrolled in a vocational institute, I assumed we would still have a close connection, until he met his “new” friends, i put in new in quotes because one of his friends is a friend i knew of (not a close one but we knew of each other mutually) His other friends are a mix of those i played football (soccer) matches against previously and those whom i have never seen before, i am usually a rational fellow, he needs to expand his horizons, be with people, the situation was that, he simply forgot about me, he doesn’t call me anymore, he doesn’t interact with me, whenever he interacts with me its for a few minutes on the way home from one of his hangouts (i sit alone at a cafe near his complex) It almost feels forced on his part, which makes sense because i did warn him to find a balance between his new group and us, me includedc because i knew that ever since he moved to Kurdistan as a child, he only had us, he only had one group, meanwhile before i met them, i had countless childhood friends whom i could balance my time with, and i knew he simply didn’t have the ability to do the same, he didn’t heed my warning or advice about it, his actions have made it very clear, for those who are thinking “ditch him”, kinda hard when you practically grew up with that person, there is still sentimental value, a few days ago, he did ask me to join his new friends at his house, i simply refused, as i am not forced to meet them, why should i? They don’t know me well and i don’t know them, they simply have no reason to meet me whatsoever, so now, he is distant, he still keeps contact (a pathetic once a month call or a “hang out”) I did get hurt at first, but then i thought “he wants me around because at heart, he is still that introverted kid, meanwhile i am the extroverted version, more outgoing and social, he tries to be social but he simply doesn’t have what i have, and he hates me for it, he wants me to give him something i can’t give, not because i don’t want to, but i can’t, how can i give you something intangible, it’s not an iphone or a car or a house, it’s me….” He is jealous of me but still needs me around, i saw that fella in a hospital bed. The end, any thoughts or advice? …………………….. …………………….. …………………….. Just for additional context, in January of this year (Wednesday, January 15th, 2025, 2:30 PM local time until 8:30 PM) i was at a cafe alone minding my own business, i get a frantic phone call from him telling me that he will get emergency surgery for testicular torsion, and he needed me to get to his house and get his mom asap, i did so promptly, his poor mom was scared shitless, almost crying righy in front of me, but I kept her calm because i knew, if i can keep her calm, i can make his siblings calm (they stayed at home) and by extension, he can stay calm pre surgery and his father (who was in Baghdad that day) calm too In the eventuality he found out, i was hungry, tired but i was in this hyperfocused state where, his safety and his family’s safety was of my upmost priority and concern, he goes into the OR, gets wheeled out, while i observe proceedings, but what broke my soul was his mom pacing around the hallway as he was in the OR, my two other friends arrived and they just chatted it up, but i couldn’t, i stayed completely still, listening to music and watching her closely, rarely speaking to her, anyway, he is drowsy and very much under anesthesia post op, that evening, she gets a call from his dad saying that he is coming back from Baghdad ASAP and he is on the plane and he will land in about an hour, she asked if anyone could bring him to the hospital, i immediately volunteered, i went to the airport, waited for him, said hello and i said his son was fine and well now, and i drove him there to hospital By that time my friend was awake and aware He asked me if i could drop off his father’s luggage at their house, i did so without a second thought, by that point i was mentally and physically exhausted, sure i looked very, unsettlingly calm, because at that moment my emotions were not important, this family had more priority than me and i did my utmost to protect them and help them in any way possible, i drove to their house His younger brother (who is a tall fellow for a teen) comes up to me And bear hugs me, thanking me profusely His parents always held a favorable view of me, even (to my detriment) comparing him to me, and saying how good i was right to his face, that day he and my friends and his family saw me at my absolute peak, firsthand, with their own eyes, they couldn’t thank me enough, but i kept saying “No guys, i did what i had to do, my friend was in a dire situation and it was imperative for me to step up no matter what, no need to thank me” After i left, i collapsed, i get a VM (voice message) from him He thanked me again for me devoting my whole day to his safety, he was thrilled but i could tell, even in my fatigue, that would not end well in the long term, at least, that inner jealousy was going to come back with a vengeance, and i would be the “trophy” and the victim simultaneously, and i couldn’t do much about that, anyway, i get a surprise call for a soccer match where i HAD to be there, keep in mind i hadn’t eaten nor slept well that whole day and the day prior, add this on top and i was in no shape, mentally or physically to play any match I played but my team could tell i was sad, i wasn’t me, i would score and not celebrate etc… A day later, he is at home, keep in mind i still didn’t and couldn’t eat anything, i could not relax, i was paying the price of being a whole family’s anchor of calmness I go to a cafeto try to relax, but i couldn’t He texts me, yes, the fucking patient texts me asking if i was alright, it was absurd and hilarious And I couldn’t lie, I said I wasn’t, i cannot eat anything, my stomach hurts and i don’t feel well at all He immediately got worried, saying he wouldn’t leave me alone until i ate, I bluntly said that he should be with his family, focus on his health and his family, and in my own words “forget about me bro, don’t worry, i simply don’t matter for now, go rest and recover” The next few days, i was obviously going to visit him again at his house, but he started practically begging me to come, he and his wanted to see me so bad, but i didn’t “feel” ready just yet I eventually did visit him and we had fun And now, we barely even speak to each other, he is off busy with his new friends, but i was simply forgotten about, his hospital stay was the last full time where he saw me, all locked in and guarded, i am not and will not use this story for you guys to “thank” or praise me i refuse praise for something any loyal friend would do, this story was just an important and detailed context for what i wrote above. Again, i am hoping to get your thoughts I am open to answering any questions about timelines or more contexts or details, please feel free to ask. Thank you for reading this long post.\n\nAnd apologies for any grammatical errors, as i wrote this out as fast as i could without checking for grammar.",

      "title": "I’m starting to grow a hatred towards my sister",
      "selftext": "I have a 27-year-old sister who has schizophrenia. I’m 21. Our parents are divorced, and when we were kids, we both lived with my mom. Even back then, I witnessed her illness up close, her behavior was unpredictable and sometimes frightening. As we got older, her illness got worse, and as my mom’s health declined, she couldn’t handle my sister anymore. Eventually, my sister went to live with my dad while I stayed with my mom.\n\nWhen my mom passed away in 2021, I moved in with my dad, who’s in his 70s, and since then, I’ve been forced to deal with the full weight of my sister’s illness again. She has repeated psychotic episodes, refuses to stay consistent with her medication, and constantly convinces herself she doesn’t need help. She’s been Baker Acted multiple times, in and out of mental facilities, arrested, and brings endless chaos into the house.\n\nShe’s hypersexual, often around shady men, having unprotected sex. She has a son she barely gives attention to and he lives with his paternal grandmother because his father struggles with drugs and neglect. My dad, despite being in his 70s, tries to step in and spend time with the child because he’s heartbroken watching the situation unfold.\n\nShe got pregnant again recently and refused to take her medication, saying she didn’t want it to affect the baby. Toward the end of the pregnancy, she had a psychotic break, attacked an EMT, got arrested, and was sent to a state hospital. Her baby is now in the system because she’s unfit to care for it and the father of it went MIA. During that time my sister was gone for about 2 months, when she’s away, the house feels peaceful. My dad isn’t tormented, and I can finally breathe. I love when she’s sent away. I know that might sound harsh to some, but it’s the only time the constant tension lifts. Even then, my dad was stressing himself out trying to get her released, saying jail isn’t the place for her and that I should care more because I “wouldn’t want to be there either.” But the truth is, any time she’s gone, I can actually relax. There’s no yelling, no walking on eggshells, no chaos. Just quiet.\n\n\nWhen she’s home, though, it’s like living on a landmine. She constantly mistreats my dad talking to him in awful ways and lashing out. But she’s also dependent on him and goes to him for everything. What makes it even harder is that she did the same thing to my mom before she passed. Watching history repeat itself with my dad breaks my heart. I love him so much and he’s all I have left after losing my mom. Seeing how much she’s stressing him out genuinely terrifies me. He’s in his 70s, and I fear that the constant chaos will drag him to the grave and if that ever happens, I don’t know if I could ever forgive her.\n\nThis has been going on since childhood. She’s choked me before, fought with my sick mom, and I’ve seen her hold a knife while fighting the urge not to use it. And that isn’t even a taste of everything she’s put my family through. I don’t feel safe around her, and I don’t want my dad or anyone else to be in danger either.\n\nI know schizophrenia isn’t her fault, but she refuses to help herself. I don’t believe she’s fit to live on her own, and honestly, I want to know if there are any facilities or programs that can take her in long-term or permanently. She needs structured care, and we can’t keep living like this. Either that or i need to get the hell out this house. But then again it’s my dad im worried about.\n\n\nLast night I even had a nightmare about her stabbing my dad, trying to hide his body, and then threatening me with a knife, cornering me and holding over me as i pleaded with her. It shook me to my core because, deep down, I’m afraid something like that could actually happen one day. That’s why i woke up with such a resentment and why i’m writing this now. \n\nI do love my sister when she’s stable, but this constant cycle has left me drained and resentful. I don’t know how to navigate this anymore. \n\nHas anyone dealt with something similar or found long term care options for a family member who can’t live independently? \n\nWhenever she’s admitted to the hospital, they never keep her. It’s like they just trap and release her like a stray cat. Medicate her, stabilize her for a moment, then send her on her merry way… only for the same cycle to repeat all over again. Something permanent needs to happen because my dad can’t handle this stress forever, and I refuse to let her drag him to the grave.\n ",

I wish I'd figured this out years ago.\n\nWhen we think of control freaks, we think of someone who tells you what to do all the time. That's actually not so bad if you hate having to make decisions.\n\nBut there's another aspect: control freaks have an image inside their heads of how things should be. Anything that doesn't fit that image makes them angry.\n\nControl freaks have 10,000 rules about how things should be, and if you can remember half of them you're a genius. And the only way to learn what they are is to get yelled at for breaking them.\n\nFail to put something away that should have been put away; get yelled at. Put something away that she was still using, or planning to use later; get yelled at. Put something away that should have been put away, but you put it away wrong; get yelled at.\n\nI've been yelled at for drying my hands on the wrong side of a towel. Most recently, I was yelled at because there was too much vinegar in the cabinet (even though I'm not the one that bought the vinegar). I've watched my stepmom yell at my father for eating his food in the wrong order.\n\nIf I ask \"how was I supposed to know that window should have been left open?\" the answer is always \"you could have just asked\". But if I *do* ask, she gets angry anyway because it's something I should have just known without asking.\n\nIf she says \"you need to do X\" and you say \"I did X this morning\", she's still angry because she knows in her heart of hearts that you didn't do it right. And usually you didn't because you don't know exactly how she wanted it done.\n\nNo advice wanted, I just needed to vent.",

I really cared about what I did and the impact that I had while working. But when I reached out for help with accommodations for my mental health, everything went to shit. I wasn’t mad or trying to be disruptive. I was just tired, stressed and having to explain myself. Somehow, that got turned into me being aggressive. That definitely stung hard.\n\nAs i've gotten older, I learned that there are a lot of people who call themselves leaders, but they don’t actually act like it. Real leaders listen. They show compassion and empathy. Leaders help people feel seen and respected. I want to be that person someday. The leader that i've always needed to be for me.\n\nEven after everything that’s happened, I still wake up every day wanting to make an impact.

      "selftext": "Tw.Mentions of rape\n\nI 18F have recently started a new college. In the uk. I haven’t made many friends yet but have been trying to make some. That’s why when this guy started talking me I was glad to possibly make a friend. He was nice but literally the second conversation he started very obviously flirting with me. I felt a bit uncomfortable but didn’t really respond to the flirting.\n\nHe’s not in my class but always waits for me when he can despite me not telling him but he’s either memorised some of my lessons or asked one of his friends my schedule. \n\nBecause literally if he’s got a free lesson or ends a bit earlier than me he’ll be sitting outside of my class. Waiting for me to come out then act like it’s a coincidence. At lunch I usually hung out at the smoke shelter so I could vape. He doesn’t smoke or vape but walks over to the vape shelter to see if I’m there. I ended up finding a new spot and now he’s found it he checked there for me to.\n\nToday I got really creeped out. I got out of a class that he didn’t finish the same time at. I went outside and him and his friends had just exited the building cause I guess their class was over but we’re going the opposite direction so I went the other way. About 10 seconds later I’m hearing footsteps behind me and it’s like the back of the school and I was scared to look back because I have PTSD from when I was younger so I get scared because of it of getting raped or kidnapped. I kept a walking for like 2 minutes and the speed increased so I started walking a bit further until I saw people then started walking normally again because people were there he then ran infront of me and was like “Hello I can’t believe I just walked into you”. As if he didn’t just ditch his friends and chase me round for several minutes.\n\nI don’t want to be rude to him or anything but I also don’t want him to keep being weird like this. I don’t know if this is just normal or whatever but I’m feeling really anxious  but I feel like I might be being a dick he’s clearly socially awkward and I don’t want to hurt his feelings.",

Disclaimer: we live in Italy and English is not my first language They started divorce proceedings in 2022 the first time but then decided to patch things up (they should have divorced in 2022). In all those years they made me miserable and their personal therapist and punching bag. They talk shit about each other to me and don’t cake at all when I say that I don’t want to hear it. This is a shitty period for me because I’m not passing exams in university, plus I just broke up with my boyfriend (who was a fantastic boyfriend and we were in a happy relationship but we noticed we have different future plans and we decided to split for both of our sake). Plus my parents use me as their listening device even if I told them more than one time that I don’t want to hear about their relationship problems (they both behave like little spiteful kids). In all that I started university 2 years late for personal reasons and my parents were aware that it took 5 years to finish it (I’m at the beginning of the fifth year right now) and my dad promised me that he would support me trough university. Now he is complaining that I’m not living by myself and still living with them at 24… he knew when I signed up for university that it was 5 years! And I can’t work a full time job to cover my expenses while I study (but in the meantime I work with my mum on our business together but it’s new and we can’t have a full salary right now). Plus when I can I do extra shifts at a restaurant as a waitress and I NEVER ask my parents for money (if it’s not for university expanses). I pay all my shopping, my travel, my outings with my money. In all of this my dad has a full time and good paying job (truck driver) but he can’t manage well his finances so he has a lot of debt and he can’t find a place to live separately but I (a full time student with part time income) have to find a living solution so I won’t live with them!!!\n\nAlso they spoil my brother a lot; he is 100% addicted to his phone and Xbox and lately he talk back in a very rude way to me. My parents don’t have rules for him and don’t discipline him. He can do everything he want and he even does not have chores around the house I’m the only one that does anything in there (aside from my mum… my dad also does not do chores). Yesterday he yelled at me and I hid his phone. He started screaming at me and at the end told me “I hope you die, we will be all better without you”. My dad was already sleeping after he drunk too much durning the day (I forgot to say, he is an alcoholic but he blames my mum for his drinking problem and said that he is not an alcoholic) and he told nothing to my brother. I called my mum (she was at work) and she just told me to give my brother his phone back. After my mum came home she acted like nothing happened and my brother didn’t even ask for forgiveness. NOTHING! I told him that I will act like I’m dead to him if it’s all he wants…\n\nMy mum tell me I’m overreacting and I have to calm down but how can I when they (my parents) put all of their emotional baggage on me and they know what I’m going through and don’t even ask “how are you?”\n\nThe only person that truly cares and listens to my rants is my ex boyfriend but I don’t think it’s fair for him to listen to my problems because we’re not together anymore.",

      "selftext": "I was with this girl who I loved dearly. She is so kind and loving and beautiful. And a pusher. The good kind of pusher, the one who tries to make you put yourself out there and be a go getter for those things you struggle with. \n\nI have a hard time making friends. It was actually a miracle I had became her best friend, and then her girlfriend. It was the level up of my dreams, but with it my friend count went to zero. She encouraged me to get out of my comfort zone and hang out with some people she knew to possibly resolve this issue. Come halloween, and she had managed to convince me to go to a party with people I loosely knew. I knew some through her and some through work. \n\nThe party was fun, and I partied hard. A bit too hard. I remember being very drunk to the point where I was almost clinging to the wall in order to keep myself upright. One of the guys from my work that I had came with noticed my struggle and offered to help me find somewhere to rest for a while. I took his help gladly. We went to an empty room and I sat on the edge of the bed. I remember him leaving and I blinked and he was back with water, but he was acting weird. He stood so close to me, almost pushing against me. He was trying to get me to take the water, but also his face leaned so close to mine. I realized he was trying to kiss me, and I turned my head. He turned it back and wrapped his arms around me so that he was holding me close. I stared at him. He told me my eyes looked like he was begging for him. I told him the didn’t, but he insisted and eventually I believed him. \n\nI don’t remember it happening well but I know it did. I was asleep on the bed and woke up at around 4 am. I was definitely groggy but i managed to make it home. I had work the next day. I didn’t think about what happened, just that I would never tell anyone. It would just be a thing that happened that you never talk about. A mistake that I had chosen that I would just have to learn from. \n\nOf course, you can’t choose how everything plays out. \n\nI came to work the next day with the coworker from the night before and my girlfriend already there. I acted like normal, she didn’t and neither did he. I looked at him and asked if he told her. She said yes for him and my chest sunk. She tried to ask me why the whole shift, but I couldn’t answer. I just shrugged, said I was a little drunk. I wasn’t thinking. \n\nWe broke up shortly after, then started talking again a few months later. We tried to make it work, but she always brought it back to what I had done and the pain it had caused her. All i could do is swallow it. Accept my wrong doing. Blame myself and swear to be better. \n\nShe permanently broke up with me after several months. She said that the pain of the past was too great and she couldn’t handle it. I understood. Before me, her ex had viciously cheated, and I was essentially the same to her. But this time when she broke up with me it killed me. I was hurting so bad. I was in love with her. \n\nI thought about telling her the truth, but after the months of apologizing and blame and amendment attempts, I knew it’d only look like a last resort to keep her. I already was a cheater to her, I wouldn’t be a manipulator too. \n\nNow I live wondering what could have been had I been courageous enough to share my story. She now is engaged to someone else. \n\nI love her. I just hope that her new love doesn’t break her heart like I did\n\n",

We stayed together for a few months after I went back home, but eventually it wasn't working and we ended it. \n\nBreak ups are fucking terrible and I took it really hard at the time. I didn't have any communication with him at all after we broke up.\n\nFast forward 8 years and I'm on a 2.5 week trip in Europe travelling by myself. I don't usually use messenger, but I don't have access to texting while I'm travelling so I opened it to message my mom.\n\nAnd then I saw that he had messaged me 3 months ago. So I responded. Long story short, I ended up booking a last minute flight to go see him for the weekend in the city where we were together.\n\nWe had a really great time. Honestly mostly just had sex the whole weekend. I had to leave at 4:30am to catch my flight back to continue my trip, and we didn't sleep at all before.\n\nHe really evolved since the last time we were together. New kinks, more sure of himself, we're both just older and more experienced now. I know he had a few serious girlfriends in the last 8 years, and I had a few relationships too but not super serious.\n\nI've kind of been single by choice for the last few years honestly, no motivation to date. I don't really have any close friends anymore either because I'm just terrible at managing work, relationships, and adult life in general\n\nAnyway I just arrived back to this city in Europe where I know no one at all. I'm overtired, my ears are still blocked from the flight 2 hours ago, I can't check into my next hostel for another 4 hours, and I'm not sure if I'll ever see this person again.\n\nIf we lived in the same city, or even the same continent I might try pursuing him again. But we don't. We live on opposite sides of the world.\n\nI knew seeing him again would make me emotional but I decided to do it anyway. Now I have another week left in my trip and I just wish I was home in my own bed with my cats.\n",

I honestly can't figure out what I want to do in life and it feels like time is running out, and every day I just feel so hopeless about where my life is going. I honestly wish I could just lose consciousness and not have to think about my future anymore, and I feel like I've been reduced to a shell of my former self.\n\nFor some context: I am by most definitions conventionally doing well--I attend a good university and have a job that is most of my cohort's dream/end goal lined up for next year. On the other hand, my greatest fear in life, the thought that keeps me up at night (ergo, now), is rotting in mediocrity. Living an unremarkable life and dying without anyone noticing the sheer presence of life that should be me fills me with an unspeakable amount of existential dread.\n\nI feel like every day, people ask me why I should settle for working an average job that the average person wants. Instead, I should be throwing my gloves into the arena and aiming for a coveted research role to push the frontiers of knowledge--my path is but the road that cowards and fools take.\n\nBut overall, I just feel so inadequate. I can apply to these roles, but without nepotism or a referral it's impossible to even get a response. Even when I apply for more standard, average roles, I've been rejected after the final round for more than 10 companies after doing at least 5 interviews each. I'm trying to become known in the field for research, but it's a process that will take at least a year from now and likely more. I don't even know what brings me joy anymore, I'm just perpetually in a state of self-beration or anxiety.\n\nFor the past few months this is all I've been able to think about, and it has ruined me. I've lost the interests I had two years ago, and the only conversation I can hold is about work or my thoughts on the despair that is my future career. I've lost the joy from spending time with many, many people in my life, and now I would often rather read a book or talk to strangers than force myself to interact with the people I was friends with--but that I now feel like judge me for my career choices, for the better or for the worse. I spend all of my time now either working or existing in a state of stress, dreading either my next task or my future.\n\nWhat should I do? Can I even do anything? Is this just a sign that I'm not working hard enough & am wasting my potential?",

      "selftext": "Before u tell me to go to therapy, im gonna need some time. Had a really bad experience with a shitty guy that made me more depressed (ik its weird, i paid for that btw) and ik not all therapists are like that but i still need time.\nIf the reason of living is living, then i dont want it. Suffering, fragility, joy and the removal of joy, i dont get it. Why should i work all of my life to have enough money to stop working?!? Its nonsense. And im tired of people saying: “well, find something you love!” Cant i just love doing stuff out of passion without obligation or rules or anything. Just pure passion and freedom of just doing anything (no hateful act) but no u gotta work ur ass off to make the society work while the 1% that owns 90% of earth just scratch their balls and do nothing. But even if i was free to do what i like, the non conscience of death seems calming, soothing, relaxing: no more toughts, no more regrets, no more of anything. Yeah sure, I’ve met wonderful people but im scared to talk to them further, because i dont wanna fuck up. For fuck sake, im not advancing in life and i wanna kill myself even tho i was born in a good loving family. I always feel lonely? Like even when im with people i dont feel like they like me as much as i like them, maybe because i lost a lot of friends or because my generosity dont get repaid… not saying that im expecting something back, just id be sooo happy to just receive something meant for me, anything. If i die ill miss them but nothing more the rest i dont care. I have nothing, i am no one and im going nowhere. And yeah i sound like someone that dont do any effort, sure. But its to a point where id prefer someone to choose my life choice: it would be easier to just do what im told like a good dog. Without the fear and anxiety of fucking up. Without  the responsibilty and toughts of the action. Without the emotions and consequence of myself. Im just lost. 20yo and i still do the same thing as i was 14yo. Im wasting my 20s. Maybe the fact that i interacted less with my parents made me less mature. Sometimes i hear my friends talking about how our system (society, law, etc.) works like it is basic knowledge and i dont even know about it. Im still a virgin. Its to the point where my type has become “gotta love me” as the only criteria. I know its my fault: i dont know how to flirt, i dont text girls on ig (i heard a lot of relationship starts there) and im a porn addict (i just feel like someone who watches porn doesnt deserve love). And while im talking about not liking life, a lot of people who dies at war (more like massacre) would take my place. While those people are dying im wasting my life, a life that a children of gaza couldve taken and lived fully. They deserve it more than an empty man. I have nothing wrong with my life but i dont get the point of living, being happy is not enough, i need a purpose. I may be atheist but i envy religious people. What im trying to say is im tired… i wanna stop having toughts: seeing the pain of the world, i wanna stop loving for it to be easier to die, stop living in inequality, seeing people jumping at each others neck just for having a different point of view or liking something else. Just 5 min of death, of nothingness, just to test the water and then plunge in. And its not the first time that im sad. When i was 15, I was hit by a car and it made me realise that i like life, not because i almost died, but because people cared… now i just dont know…. Maybe i need another near death experience. I just wanna feel appreciated, but i cant. I even studied psychology just to help myself (it helped a bit).",

      "selftext": "\nI’m going to try and keep it as short as possible. Apologies in advance for any grammar mistakes that i’ll definitely make along the way, English is not my first language.\n\nMy (24F) mom (61) has unexpectedly suffered a heart attack, which led to a massive stroke. She had prior history of cardiovascular disease, but not to this extent. At first the doctors weren’t sure as to what the prognosis would be for her, but a few days ago one of them finally broke the news that she’s going to either pass away soon or stay on a ventilator in a coma for a while and then pass away due to the brain swelling regardless. It all comes as a massive shock to me and my brother (19M), as we lost our father to the same type of stroke in 2017, and, as you may imagine, we haven’t been ourselves ever since. \n\nWhen she was first admitted to the hospital, my brother was in the army and had no sell phone reception whatsoever, so it took a couple of days and a massive effort from our military-affiliated friends to actually get to him and break the news. He is most likely going to be discharged from his service, as our mother’s condition is considered terminal and he’s virtually an orphan in terms of our country’s law.\n\nThe thing is, it’s difficult not to get angry at our remaining relatives for the way they’re dealing with the situation at hand. She has an older brother (66), who either doesn’t know what to do or doesn’t care and expects us to deal with it regardless. Her nephews (36 and 40M) are uncooperative at best and actively sabotaging the flow of medical information at worst. They treat me and my brother as children, yet expect us to deal with everything that comes with a terminally ill, bed-bound and severely brain damaged parent, let alone our last living close relative. They bombard me with calls and messages, saying that “it’s in god’s hands now” and “what comes, goes”, and it’s not exactly helping. Some of them even discuss the possibility of intensive care, speech therapy and hospice services, despite us telling them multiple times that life is not a soap opera and people with up to 70% of their brain dead don’t just come back to live a normal life, especially if they have a tube permanently attached to their throat, as they’re unable to breath and swallow on their own.\n\nThis whole ordeal is pure nightmare fuel, since my mother used to be a nurse specializing in dealing with these kinds of patients at ERs and intensive care units and specifically told me and my brother that if anything like this happens to her in the future, she doesn’t want this kind of existence to go on for long. We know this damn well, but our country’s laws regarding terminally ill patients and medically assisted passings are lacking in comparison to USA and Europe. We don’t have a say at what happens to her from now on and legally have to take care of her body if she’s ever discharged from the hospital. I’m not opposed to it, and it’s already been decided that i’m going to give up my job and do so if the need arises, but it sucks for all of us nonetheless. \n\nThanks for giving me space to vent and speak freely about my feelings. I haven’t been able to express my grief and frustration, and come on, how do you even grieve a person who’s still living? ",

She did not take it well, she accepts wrong doing and says it was a laps in judgement but sadly this isn't something we are going to be able to reconcile. \n\nThanks again to everyone who took the time to comment and/or reach out. It helped more than you might think. Additionally, a couple of people reached out offering money to help me replace the cards. As much as that is a kind gesture, I won't be accepting any donations but if you are feeling generous please consider donating to your local homeless shelter.\n\n  \nThis will be the last update from me on this.

      "selftext": "I (23F) met a guy (28M) three weeks ago. Over the past three weeks, we went on eight dates. He is good looking. He had a really sweet demeanor and charm. He was sensible, cared about my feelings, and gave me great advice about family and career. He was calm and confident in a way I admired. He told me he was looking for a serious relationship, and his values seemed to align with mine. He didn't have social media, and he opened up to me about his past, his family, and even his puppy. We had great chemistry. \n\nAfter eight dates, and during a playful moment I decided to invite him to a motel room, and he agreed. We were \"intimate\" for about four hours, but then he completely changed. He became cold, his expression and eyes changed... like he wasn't there anymore, and he didn’t say a single word. He calmly dressed, left, and blocked me everywhere. \n\nWhat do I do now? What happened?",

Before I realized it I had began to veer off the road and the realization gave me a rush of adrenaline which got me through the rest of the trip.

I spent ages in this dream looking for her and then finally we met again, we were both so excited. Then we went to cuddle again and just as we sat down on the couch I woke up.\n\nThere was nothing out toward, nothing sexual, nothing strange, just pure love. \n\nOne thing that stuck out to me is that in real life I have no idea who this person is but as I said above for some reason their face was familiar.\n\nIt’s such a horrible feeling waking up and then realising it was a dream.

      "selftext": "Throughout the second semester of 7th grade and the entirety of eighth grade, I was a weird kid. I was an awkward guy at the time so I decided to play a character of a pervert because it made my friends laugh and I was able to socialize. Towards the second semester of 8th grade, I started to realize the dependence that I had developed for this character that I would play at school for the sake of socialization. I also noticed the fake laughs, became aware of the many times people would laugh at me when I thought they were laughing with me. I became aware of the self imposed reputational damage I was inflicting onto myself. I became trapped in this clownish character that I still had to play as my awkwardness did not improve yet. It was not until the summer break between 8th and 9th grade when I learned how to socialize without the use of this iron maiden of a character. I’m in 9th grade now and my reputation is still in the ground due to 7th and 8th grade but it is slowly improving due to more people realizing that I’ve changed and me learning how to socialize with other people as myself and not as a manufactured, perverted, clownish character.\n\nSome more information about the kind of weird kid I was: One of the things I would say is, “get down, get sneaky, I’m about to get freaky.” I thought that it was funny and that other people did too. They were most likely laughing at me whenever I said that because I would stick my tongue out of my mouth most of the time after saying that. I would also have “quote of the days.” Some examples include, “the older the berry, the sweeter the juice,” “if she 3, them she’s ready for me,” “if she’s four, she’s ready for more.” I would also openly stare at the girls’ butts at school along with talking about how big they are at lunch make perverted jokes and comments about them. Another thing I did was yell so most of the girls around me would hear while on the field for an in school club meeting/event, “too many bad b!tches, I can’t take it!” I was lucky I was not reported to our principal then. Yet another thing that happened as a result from playing this perverted clown of a character is this one girl making fun of me by simply saying, “what’s up (my name).” Whenever she would say that, I would just stick my tongue out like this (😛) because I did not know how to reply to someone asking me, “what’s up?” And my reaction was made even more awkward due to the fact that this girl was usually with her friends and was attractive, making me feel even more awkward and would cause me to lean into this character that I would play even more.",

My \"friend\" knows of my ex from his high school (we didn't go to the same) and he reached out to her. Things happened and they ended up dating.\n\nFrom my perspective, I felt like it was a slap in the face. He was one of my kids godfather and for him to date my ex shouldn't have happened. Yes, I know it's not my business who my ex date but it had to be him? I lost my cool and b\\*tched him out and dropped him like a bad habit. We ended up not talking and honestly didn't give it anymore thought.\n\nPRESENT:\n\nIt's been more than 20+ years and I went on with my life. I'm good in life and happy where I'm at. Eventually, I found out (from my kids) that my ex and my \"friend\" didn't work out (again, I gave them no thoughts and was a happenstance when I found out) and from what my kids know, he's been single all these time. I've heard from my other friends that still talk to him that he was going through the motion and even admitted that he's been wondering all the what if's. I guess one of my friend gave him my number and he called.\n\n\"Hello?\"\n\n\"Hey bro, it's \\[friend\\].\"\n\n\"Oh, sup.\"\n\n\"Hey, \\[Mirror\\], it's been years and just wanted to catch up.\"\n\n\\*\\*\\* PAUSE\\*\\*\\*\n\n\"What do you want?\" I asked...\n\n\"Oh, just wanted to chit chat.\"\n\n\"There's really nothing to talk about and I'm good. Have a good life.\"\n\nAnd I hung up.\n\nAs stated earlier, it's been years and minus that time when all the crap happened, I never gave him any thought and today, I still felt the same but weirded out.

No one with a small account there follows a former high school classmate so many years later, but I tried to overlook it because he has a larger number of followers so thats maybe the reason.\n\nGetting back to the subject, she always posts photos with me on her stories and such, but she never posted on her feed. Until Saturday, when she posted a photo dump and our photo was the fifth of seven photos. It turns out that today she posted another photo dump of an outing she had with her sister and got a lot more likes than the previous, At first I didn't cared much because this one has her face as first pic where the previous one was a landscape.\n\nBut the devil whispered in my ear and I went to check the likes and see the differences who liked just this dump and realized that this guy didn't liked the dump I was in but liked the new, so I went to see her older the posts and he liked every. fucking. one. except the one with me.\n\nI ended up being low contact the rest of the day because I wasn't in the mood to argue, but I'm wondering if I should bring it up tomorrow or if I'm being paranoid...

I went to college for an arts degree assuming that I’d get somewhere in the field yet i dont feel like I have the skill that could ever measure up. Being from a place that isn’t first world, it’s scary to want to move to any place other than here.\n\nMy mom never owned a house or land even when she had countless opportunities to, my dad is selfish and doesn’t really want to leave anything for me, nor let me rent from his house which he’s perfectly capable of doing. My mom is a narcissist who has drove me over the edge so many many times that I don’t know if I can last any longer with her. \n\nI’m scared that if either of them die I’ll be left with nothing and have to work hard in this already shirty economy just to struggle, all of my dreams all or passions will have to be thrown down the drain because of two people’s selfishness and poor planning. I try to bring this up to them but my mom has mentally checked out of her relationship with me at this point because “she’s a Christian” and I do “non-christan” things like, have a girlfriend who I have sex with. It still baffles me that she puts God over her own son who is really trying to have a relationship with her but she just can’t wrap her head around that.\n\nI have so many little plans in my head, loans I could take to maybe build my credit but every time I think to hard it’s like nothing is going to work out. Why am I trying so hard when I could have just ended things so long ago. How can I even make it in this economy at this point?\n\nEvery accomplishment i make is just glossed over by everyone and it just makes me want to disappear. I’ve been working since 17 because my mom couldn’t really afford sending me to college yet she has never acknowledged that. I could have stayed without a job and bled her dry but I got one just to help her out yet she still thinks of it as just a little gig. I spend so many hours and worked hard even with my assignments yet all my effort surmounts to nothing.\n\nEven telling my family my dreams of owning a house is just seen by blank stares. Nobody even my great grandparents have ever owned one, and nobody takes me seriously for wanting to actually better myself. They just all want me to struggle like they did, just to end up renting until they die. ",

      "selftext": "Just what the title says. I realized I was asexual when I was about 20 and I realized I was aromantic at about 26. I've never been in any kind of relationship. I'm still a virgin at 29. These are all things I am totally comfortable with. What I'm bothers me is that even though I don't have any desire for a romantic relationship, I still want a person, you know? A partner. But who would be interested in a purely platonic commitment? I'm sure there are some people out there, but none I've met in real life.\n\nIt's tough because I know who I am, and I'm genuinely happy to be aroace. It's who I am. But its also very hard to watch all my friends find their person, settle down into relationships and starting families, and they inevitably drift apart from me. And I'm happy for them I really am! I understand why they have less time for me when they're entering another phase of life I can't follow them into. But that's also just really lonely.\n\nAnd beyond the companionship of a commited partner, there's also the financial aspect. I can't afford to live on my own. I need to have a roommate. It would be nice if I had a level if security with a roommate who wouldn't leave, you know? Lol. In all seriousness, if I have to have a roommate, it would be nice if it was someone who would stick with me. It would be nice to have someone to lean on, who I would know, even if we got evicted tomorrow, would be there with me, figuring out a plan together.  I feel like so much of adult life is made for people in relationships, and it's very hard to go at this life alone, even if you want to.\n\nHonestly maybe all of this anxiety comes from me being afraid of a financial future where I'm still renting with roommates at 50, unable to afford to live on my own. In that case I guess the answer is not \"Find a partner\" but \"Find a job that pays you more\" lol. But I don't know, if I had a partner and we could only afford to rent with roommates too, I think I would feel a lot better about that than if I was by myself. But I also think if I could afford to live on my own I wouldn't worry as much about being alone. If I could live on my own I would want to take care of foster kids, though, so even in this plan I still want to have people in my life, even just temporarily. I don't know. I'm talking about this hypothetical person almost like they're a piggy bank or a security blanket and not a human being and if I did have a partner I would sincerely hope that's not how I would feel about them or treat them.\n\nMaybe what I really want is a home. Be that in a physical place, or in a person. I just want some stability.\nI guess as an aroace person, I feel like I need to be completely self sufficient because I can't rely on another person the way people in romatic relationships can and it's just scary to live your life like that. I'm extremely lucky in that I have a close family. My parents are extremely supportive and my siblings are people I can talk to about anything. So I'm not alone in the world by any means. But I don't want to always have to go to my parents when I have a problem I can't solve by myself. Maybe that's me being too proud, but I also never want to be a mooch.\nI don't like to complain about this, usually. I'm sure this whole rant is coming off as completely incoherent because this is truely the first time I've ever articulated these feelings.\n\nUltimately I know that in many ways I'm a very lucky person, and I do have a lot of love and support in my life. And I also know that having a partner doesn't solve all your problems, and it isn't all sunshine and rainbows all the time. But I also think that if you find the right partner, maybe all the harder stuff in life is a little easier to endure. Maybe having someone in your life who you see everyday, who understands you, and wants to build a life with you, maybe having someone like that makes everyday a little bit better. And maybe knowing that you're that person for /your/ person gives life a little more meaning than it used to. \n\nI think romantic relationships are beautiful. I love love. Despite that, I'm not sad I probably won't experience a romantic relationship. I love romantic love for /other/ people lol. But I do still kind of hold out hope that maybe, there's a platonic relationship out there I could experience that would be just as beautiful, in a different way. One day. In the meantime I guess I work on myself. I try to stand on my own two feet, and I put myself out there (horrifying but I'm told that's how you make friends).\n\nSo I don't know, if you've made it this far, and you have any words of encouragement or something let me know 😅. Thank you for reading my spiral. I feel a lot better now, actually.",

My mom served herself a leg ate it with her hands and LICKED her fingers clean then immediately got up pet the cat and TOUCHED my pie with her hand, I guess to see if it was cool enough to eat. I was immediately so disgusted, I faked being sick and said I couldn’t stomach the pie. I’m sitting in my room now wiping my cats head with a wet paper towel (he stinks like chicken grease so badly) while my parents eat the pie I was so excited for. For some extra context, I’m autistic and an absolute neat freak. I’ve been having trouble with my mom a lot lightly, she has a gross habit of picking her teeth and her feet (sometimes at the same time, with the same unwashed hands) usually she does this while watching tv or videos on her phone (aka rubbing her dirty foot fungus saliva covered hands on the remote or her phone) and it makes me actually physically ill. I can’t tell her how much what she does bothers me or else she’ll flip out, she’s threatens to divorce my dad over it and screams at me for hours sometimes. I guess her mom was mean about her being gross when she was young, but she is gross and I can’t stand it anymore. She ruins everything for me being so disgusting and now I can’t even eat my apple pie :(\n\nEdit: thank you to everyone who said I was valid for being grossed out by her, she lowkey had me thinking I was crazy for being weirded out lol. I’m buying a new pie first thing tomorrow and I’ll eat the whole thing all by myself (the breakfast of champions) cheers yall. ",

      "title": "I seriously need time away from my family",
      "selftext": "I love my family but as we all know being around them constantly starts to grate. There are 5 of us here in the house (me, mom, sister, grandma and niece). It’s more of a necessity than anything being that we all help gmom out since she pretty much can’t do anything on her own much these days and it helps out financially since we all contribute in different ways.\n\nSaying all of that though, this all comes with the annoyances of living with other humans. I just never feel like I can truly have a moment of peace because there is ALWAYS someone home so that kind of keeps me on edge. It’s hard to keep things clean because I feel like as soon as I do, someone comes right behind me and makes even more of a mess than before so I just feel defeated. \n\nI’m not much of a caretaker by admission. I was never really the type to be super sentimental and kinda just wanna get things done and over with in a quick and efficient fashion but my seriously dépendant gmom is extremely and annoyingly particular so a 30 second task can easily turn into a 5-10 minute one left unchecked. I do what I can trying my best to not be irritated but something always happens or is said that has to make me stop and count to 10. A\n\nMy niece is on the spectrum so I help my sister where I can with that. All last school year I got her ready and took her to school in the morning. I did for a bit this year but couldn’t continue and I do feel bad about it and that I let my sister down but I feel it was what was best. Reason being is that I truly don’t understand the ins and outs of her meltdowns and don’t know how to calm since she’s nearly non verbal. I truly think I am on the spectrum myself (that’s another story) and it all just overwhelms me. Sometimes she would just refuse to brush her teeth in the morning but won’t let me do it for her either. She would always ask for cereal and I’d make her a bowl but she always wasted it because she was too busy playing with the iPad. I personally think my sister does a complete disservice by allowing her to be on that thing as much as she but I understand the reasoning and she’s not my child so I keep that opinion to myself.\n\nI’m always looking for different opportunities to make and save money to get my own place and get out of here but it’s easier said than done most times. Just recently picked up a hosting/serving job at a local distillery I love a few towns over. Pay is decent but I can only work Friday nights and Saturdays since I also have a full time m-f 9-5. I try to spend as much time outside of the house as I can just to free myself of some of the annoyances at home whether it be at the gym or hanging out with a friend. \n\nIf you’re wondering about my dad, he’s a few states away. We talk sporadically and are working on building a better relationship with each other step by step. He offered me to come stay but that wouldn’t work logistically since I only live 20 minutes away from both jobs. \n\nI just need an escape from it all for long while.\n",

It hasn’t caused problems yet, but doctors told me it raises my risk later in life of developing dilated cardiomyopathy – a condition that weakens the heart muscle and can cause dangerous arrhythmias or even heart failure.\n\nTraining has always been my life. It keeps me grounded, focused, and gives me purpose. I still push myself hard in strength training, but since getting this news I’ve been scared to go all out with running or high-intensity cardio. It feels like I’m constantly holding back, and that messes with my head.\n\nI’m terrified that one day everything I love about training could be taken away – or that I’ll be put on medications that lower testosterone, energy and physical ability. It feels like I could lose my manhood, the thing that makes me me.\n\nI’ve always seen myself as a family man. But I learned that if I want biological children safely, it might have to be through IVF with embryo testing to remove the RBM20 mutation before pregnancy. The reason that’s considered safest is because there’s about a 50% chance of passing the mutation on naturally. IVF lets you avoid that risk while still having your own biological child. It’s still my own child, completely biological, but the thought of “creating life in a lab” feels heavy. I worry no girl would want to go through that with me, and it makes my dream of a future family feel like it’s slipping away.\n\nOn top of that, I always felt like I had so much potential – good health, drive, discipline – and then this one mutation showed up and changed how I see myself and my future completely.\n\nLately I’ve been feeling extremely low and hopeless, like I’m trapped in a dark place with no way out. It scares me how heavy these thoughts are and I don’t know how to handle it.\n\nI’m still trying to stay positive, train smart and move forward, but mentally it’s been really hard.\n\nWould you ever be with someone who has a genetic mutation like this, knowing that having kids might require IVF and embryo testing instead of the “normal” way?\nAnd if anyone has gone through something similar – how did you come to peace with it and keep hope for the future?\n\nThanks for reading. I just needed to let it out.\n",

      "selftext": "There's so many things I could talk about, but I'll try to keep this short. I'm the youngest sibling of about six, at least that I know of. All of them are half siblings, five from my dad (60s) and one from my mom (40s). I grew up only living with my older half sister on my moms side and only really knowing my moms side of the family since her and my dad split pretty young. All my siblings on my dads side were adults by the time I was born, and I never really saw much of that side of the family anyways, except one older brother who regularly came to visit me and spend time with me once they figured out my dad had another kid.\n\nI never really felt like my moms family liked me all that much growing up, I don't know if it was because my dad was a horrible person and they just hated me by extension or if I just wasn't an easy to like kid, but I always felt like they preffered my older sister. A lot of stuff happened in life, I was taken out of my moms custody at around 16 and placed with my older brother. I'm almost 19 now, and it feels like I don't have any real family left. I haven't talked to anyone on my moms side of the family, including my mom and sister, in years. They don't reach out, and when I try, I'm either ignored or given short answers and ghosted.\n\nI spend more time with my dads side of the family now (not dad, haven't seen him in years, plan to keep it that way. Most of the family agrees on that.) but it never actually feels like spending time with family. at holiday gatherings I feel like a ghost in the corner, just sitting on my phone because no one wants to talk to me. I don't know if I come off as stand-offish, I try to be engaged when people talk to me, but it never seems to last for more than a couple minutes.\n\nThey all have memories together that I know nothing about and talk about dead relatives I never met. I try to engage with my nieces and nephews, but they don't really know me or respond to me much. It feels worst at Christmas, when we gather and everyone else seems to get presents specific to them and their interests and I get some cash and random things. I don't want to be ungrateful, I appreciate that they at least try to think of me and get me something, but it still hurts.\n\nLiving with my brother doesn't really help much either, we spent a lot of time together when I was younger, but now that I live with him, it feels like we never talk or spend time together. His wife is nice, at least. I think she can tell it upsets me and tries to make up for it by spending time with me when she can, but I think we both know it's not the same.\n\nIt just feels horrible, constantly feeling like some tacked on reminder, constantly being told I look like my dad when family members do talk to me, constantly changing my appearance hoping in some childish way that maybe if I look less like him, they'll like me more and see me as an actual family member instead of just my dads youngest kid who's just there now because I don't have anywhere else to go because my mom and her family stopped caring about me, or constantly wondering if this is the year my moms family will finally remember I exist and try to talk to me. It feels horrible. I feel so alone.",

I wonder why they even bother posting these videos if they are just gonna waste the viewer’s time by not uploading the stories entirely. \n\nEven if there is a part two to the video why don’t they have them together along with the updates if the videos are not gonna be long either way?

I became Soo horny. I went in and out of toilet to masturbate but I didn't know how to ejaculate. it frustrated me because I kept thinking about it. but yeah not long after that I just figured out how. I haven't stopped since. \n\nupon seeing many pornographic contents. I became desensitized, I looked for more. I explored into fetishes. regular ones didnt stimulate my brain as much as it had before. and alot of those fetishes, I became desensitized with those as well.  \n\nReached to my adulthood. I've met few women, cool! we hit things off and decided to get freaky. I couldn't believe I finally was able to get laid, when we finally went to bed? couldn't maintain erection, I was contemplating with myself during sex. \"why am I not feeling so motivated?\". the thought of having sex was far more exciting than having sex itself. I had to think about my favourite sex scene from my favourite videos in order to somehow keep erection and orgasm. \n\nI rationalized the underwhelming experience as a first timer, should be reasonable right?. well then I had 2nd, 3rd 4th 5th 6th and eventually into the double digit territory. it felt the exact same.  I had to use external material in order for me to enjoy actual sex. \n\nit has been soo bad, that even my WET DREAMS, is of me masturbating watching porn because my brain just isn't stimulated by actual sex that it chooses Me watching porn and jerking off when it decides to give me wet dreams. \n\nI want that feeling of being excited for actual sex. I want to enjoy actual sex. I want to feel as horny as I was as a teen.  Im beginning to explore into pills to possibly help me with getting it up and bringing the excitement again. \n\nI can get laid just fine, but whenever I go a week without ejaculation,  due to work. my instinct seeks women attention, but in my mind I know I'd be wasting my 1 week retention to an underwhelming experience if I do real sex. so I find myself rejecting actual sex , and decide to do it on my own.

I hype him up before drop off and always go through the things he can do when he’s starting to get upset but, nothing I am doing is working. I feel like a failure, I shouldn’t have became a mother.

He told me there are days he loves me but sometimes idk…but he believes love takes time where it grows naturally. If I'm being honest I am not sure how to feel because usually the men I used to date were sure about me. Also, I’m just talking about this because it made me sad but he tells me he’s willing to stay and work things out I just don't want him to force himself to stay with me if he knows he doesn't love me but wants to wait and see you know. He loves spending time with me to the point he introduced me to his friends but not his parents which I don't have a problem I don't mind waiting till he's ready. I'm not sure if it's because he never had a serious relationship. After all, most of his talking stage lasted a month or a couple of weeks so they never took him seriously. Till he met me that is when I took him seriously because I do like him a lot yk. Never went through this kind of relationship but I'm willing to stay but from now on I will protect my peace and see any red signs. \nBy the way when I say committed I mean he's not sure if he's committed as in if he wants to spend the rest of his life with me.",

Sure, friends and family throw you the usual encouragements, “you’ll find someone,” “don’t give up,” but reality had other plans. Every single date felt like proof that finding someone genuine where I am is nearly impossible. And for an average guy? It’s twice as hard (whatever that means lol).\n\nAbout a year ago, I had planned a short European trip with a friend. Nothing fancy, total budget trip. While looking for hotels, we noticed some spots in Asia were literally four times cheaper than what we were seeing in Europe. After a few hours of scrolling and talking, we said screw it, let’s switch it up and hit Asia instead, see as many places as we can.\n\nWe actually did it.  \nAnd holy hell, it changed everything.\n\nOut of curiosity, we downloaded an Asian? Or more of a local dating app among the usual set of apps (just to see what it’s like). With the help of this awesome guy we met in Thailand (shoutout to that legend), we got on the local apps as well for the fun of it lol… and man, it completely flipped how I look at dating.\n\nThe difference in energy was unreal. Matches were warm(er?), open, and curious. Conversations weren’t ...dead?. For the first time in years, dating for me actually felt fun again.\n\nNow I get it. After seeing it myself… yeah. I’m finally happy. And I honestly don’t care anymore what anyone back home thinks.\n\nEdit: typo  \nEdit #2: People are assuming so many things just because I said i met someone in Asia? What? When did it become bad to say you went somewhere and met someone you like?  \nEdit #3: I've used Tinder, OkCupid, and Matchcatch.",

I'm sorry I couldn't figure out who I was quickly enough when I had no lesbians around to look up to and learn from. I'm sorry I found out I was pregnant leaving an abusive relationship, and the only reason I didn't end up killing myself was because I had to get my shit together to raise this baby.

I'm not saying I'm gonna find some poor guy to lead on or cheat on, either. I am certain I can find someone who can be like a best friend to me, and we can have a fulfilling emotional relationship. I can care about anyone, regardless of gender. I'll just put up with the intimacy.

      "selftext": "So I was in my senior year of my bachelors degree and tbh, I was really struggling. My mental health has never been great and when it gets worse, even though I’m very smart, my grades struggle. I had a class that was based on only a few assignments (6 papers that made up the whole class- 4 papers, a midterm, and a final) and I was struggling to get them done. About halfway through the semester, my professor sent out an email that he would be late turning in grades, as his sister has passed away and he would be out of town for her funeral. Out of about 20 students, I was the only one that emailed back, just saying ‘I’m sorry for your loss’. It wasn’t anything special, but I’d lost my grandpa earlier that year and knew how meaningful a simple ‘I’m sorry’ could be. Out of 6 papers, I turned in 4, I think, and was at a serious risk of not passing/ not being able to graduate on time. The thing is, he graded backwards, so instead of starting at 0 and working your way up as you got grades back, you started at 100 and worked your way down. So, even though I had missed 2 papers, I still had an 85% average. I was stressed the whole time as I waited for grades to come back, but as the deadline passed, my grade never dropped. It stayed at 85, which meant that I passed the class and was able to graduate. He never graded the papers I didn’t turn in. I have my degree now, did the ceremony, got the paper in the mail, so it’s definitely too late to say anything. Some part of me is worried someone will find out and I’ll have to go retake the class, but tbh, I’m just grateful I was able to pass when I didn’t think I would. I don’t know for sure that it’s because of what I said, but it’s the only thing that stands out with my behavior in the class. I guess I just feel a bit guilty and needed to be out with it. If I really did pass because of what I said, though, I guess it just proves that being kind (even super minimally) can sometimes pay off",

      "title": "I’m currently pregnant, and I swear our late son is guiding me through it.",
      "selftext": "I know this sounds crazy. I’m fully aware, but I swear he’s holding my hand. \n\nWe lost our son late into the pregnancy about two years ago. It was a monumental loss in our lives, compounded by trauma, and it took some time before my husband and I decided to try again. It took us several months, but now here I am, currently about 27 weeks pregnant with our daughter. \n\nI’m not going to lie, it’s been hard. I purposefully take moments every day to appreciate the feeling of her actively kicking inside of me, and making space for the joy that is her. But carrying her after the experience of him, still brings with it a lot of reliving. A lot of nerves. A lot of uncertainty. And I do my best to combat it with hope and strength and grace, but it’s all still there under the surface. \n\nOctober is pregnancy loss awareness month, and the 15th is the official day of remembrance. It’s also the day we held his memorial service, two years ago. We semi-recently moved, and I have had all his things packed in a box, but today I decided it was time to get it out and set up his memorial shelf. I’ve had this shelf up since we moved in with the purpose of making it his, but today I decided I wanted it set up so it’s ready for the 15th and I felt well enough to do it. I got his urn out, the print of his feet, and needless to say, it made for an emotional morning. \n\nAfter it was done, I was starting to feel emotionally drained so I went and worked on my crochet project. Once I felt okay again, I hopped on social media and got on marketplace for no real particular reason. I just did. I started scrolling through the “suggested” sells (or whatever they’re called) and there was a listing for an ultrasound photo frame. Thinking it would look cute for our daughter’s nursery, I clicked on it. The image opened larger, and that’s when I noticed. The wooden frame was engraved with names - both first names, and they were mine and my son’s. \n\nI just sat and stared at the photo for a few minutes before I messaged the seller, and I’m still waiting on her to respond. My son and I, we don’t have outlandish names by any means, but they are unique in the sense they aren’t ones you normally see or hear on a regular basis. So to see them both together, literally engraved into a sonogram frame as just *my name & his name*, blew my mind. I felt his presence so strongly; I still do. \n\nI’m not a big believer in signs, but they’ve been kind of crazy lately. This might be the oddest most specific one. \n\nBut since I’ve been pregnant, somehow I have managed to look at a digital clock at 12:34 PM almost every single day. Being in the third trimester now, I’m constantly finding myself getting up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night and I have to walk through our kitchen to get there, and oddly enough, again almost every time the stove light reads 12:34 AM. \n\nI saw a psychic a few months ago. Solely because I’ve always had a fascination with them and not believing in them. I’ve always wanted to do a session because how could these random people actually know anything about you? So when I saw a local one was hosting a “sale”, I booked a session, and went in as a complete non-believer and tried to be as “grey” with my answers to her questions as possible. I was around one month pregnant at the time - I didn’t mention it, the loss, anything related at all. She told me congratulations on the pregnancy of our little girl, and she said she heavily sensed it was being guided by a very young male presence - and then named our son by name, first and middle. \n\nI’ve seen more rainbows in the past few months, than I have in my entire life.\n\nI have heard his unique name more in the past few months, than I have in my entire life.\n\nThe frame today, on the day I gave his urn a home, has me convinced he’s here somehow. That he’s *been* here, somehow. I’ve been emotional about it all day. \n\nI took a screenshot of the frame and sent it to my mom in a text, after telling her I finally put his shelf together. She called me right after in disbelief. She said, *”How amazing is that?”* \n\nI don’t even have the words.\n\n",

      "selftext": "So I live in an apartment complex. Everyone is pretty close together. It started off with these people constantly being loud. Blasting music, screaming, their dog never shutting up etc. I've personally called the police on them twice for noise complaints. Once they were out partying at 4:30 am. They had beer cans all over the place and all that. They also have a habit of getting drunk and shouting their entire business to the neighborhood. \n\nThat was when I learned one of them is on probation. I didn't learn what for until somewhat recently. I ran into a friend who is the cousin of them. My lovely neighbor is on probation for armed robbery. On top of that, they let their kids do whatever they want. They leave their shit in our yard, sit on our back porch, and are just as loud as their parents. They broke either a pot or a vase in our other neighbor's yard maybe like a month ago. \n\nWe also take care of the neighborhood stray cats. We feed them, pet them, and even built them a little house in the back yard. One of the cats gave birth in there. The neighbor's kids stole her kittens. We never found out what they did with them until today. \n\nThe humane society was in our neighborhood today. I guess the neighbor's kids were tossing kittens in the air and hitting them with a baseball bat. Someone called the police and told them that. But since they don't have any photographic evidence, the neighbors were given a warning. ",

      "selftext": "This will be the last time I post about this because I want to move on. I am divorced and I have a new life and that part of my life is over.\n\nTo give a short recap of my last post: I found out my ex-spouse was into cross-dressing. I was told it was a personal thing behind closed doors, and I honestly didn't mind having it in our bedroom, however it turned out my ex-spouse cheated on me with more men and woman than could be counted. When I filed for divorce because of the cheating, my ex-spouse came out as transgender. People turned on my after my ex-spouse came out as transgender, even if they were initially supportive after finding out I left because of the cheating. You really find out who your friends and loved ones are when something like this happened. It ripped me apart inside to first lose my ex-spouse and then have everyone else abandon me. My divorce took a long time because my ex-spouse was transitioning and also because the divorce was only wanted on my part and not the part of my ex-spouse.\n\nMy update is that we are now divorced. But more than 5 months after the divorce my ex-spouse has asked me for another chance to rekindle the relationship. My ex-spouse wants to give things another go even after admitting to cheating on me with more men and women to count. I had to threaten to get a restraining order to make my ex-spouse leave me alone. After I found out about the cheating I moved to a new city, found a new job and started rebuilding my life after being abandoned by pretty much everyone. I left Vancouver and moved to another part of the province to start over. I didn't want to get pulled back into my own life after my ex-spouse destroyed me and shattered my heart.\n\nI want to thank everyone who supported me in the comments and were kind. It helped more than I can tell you especially since everyone I was close to in real life seemed to abandon me. One other thing I wanted to note is that I have absolutely no problem with transgender people or gay people. None at all. I wasn't trying to deadname my ex-spouse in my other posts. I just used the same name throughout so it wasn't confusing. The name I picked when I made my first post was a fake name anyways and not my ex-spouse's real name. I didn't mean to offend anyone, I know some comments and messages I got sent were angry at me for that but it wasn't my intention. I also used the name instead of pronouns to make it less confusing. It was never my intention to hurt or upset anyone. Thank you.",

Our house has two bedrooms, mine on the ground floor and mom's which is kind of an attic room. I have a bunk bed so we're not sleeping right next to each other.\n\nMom moved into my room around the beginning of summer because her room would get very warm making it hard to sleep there. I understood, but suggested we switch rooms, thinking I would be able to handle the heat, but she insisted that I shouldn't sleep there either. So we began to share my room.\n\nCurrently, the room hasn't been that warm for a while now, but she didn't seem to consider moving back. I didn't know how to bring it up because I love her and I know it would hurt her feelings no matter how I phrased it. To my relief, this week she said she'd move back on the weekend. Well Sunday has passed and she still sleeps in my room. This time the reason is because her room is too cold...\n\nThe weather turned cold really fast and we're in the middle of some repairs. Unfortunately the plumbers left a pipe open which is connected to the radiators so we can't turn on the heating right now. They are supposed to come on Monday and fix it so hopefully she'll move back after that.\n\nI'm just frustrated because I think sleeping in the cold should be more tolerable than the summer heat. She seems to be sorry about the situation and I said that it's fine and that she doesn't bother me because again I don't want to break her heart. I would gladly sleep in her room, but then she'll know that she is indeed bothering me. Vent over.",

I know I’m a collage of things put together from everyone around me and I absolutely love and adore that bc I love or have loved all these people at some point. I think that’s beautiful. But where do I come from? Me specifically? Everything has changed so much with every person I love and every heartbreak it feels so odd and awful to suddenly not know who I am without them. It hurts the most because everyone around me prides me on having such a strong sense of self and being so unapologetically me.  But I don’t know who I am anymore. I don’t know if I’m searching for some deeper meaning that doesn’t exist or if I’m just spiraling for no reason. I am not quite sure of my place in the world or if I have one. I used to be so sure I was the artist. Someone who is okay to be alone and not have friends because I could create beautiful things. But the comparison and lack of creativity has ruined that for me. My art in all forms feels forced. I’ve been in fight or flight mode for so long I just need something to dedicate myself to. And I can’t find that. I don’t know if it’s that I have no purpose or just that I need to get out of this phase to enjoy the little things again.

But lately I can barely go through my daily life without breaking down or getting incredibly angry. I don’t know how to fix it. I don’t know how to get back into my groove. I don’t know how to be me again. It’s so painful bc I want to so so very badly. But waiting out my emotions feels like wasting time. I just want to be out in the world. Doing things. Enjoying my life. But I’m stuck here on the couch crying about to take a nap at 4 pm because I did a few household chores and now I’m dizzy and need to sleep it off. But I work long hours. Today is my last day off until my party. I want to have fun but so much needs to be done and it’s so hard to let myself breathe and relax. I don’t understand. I just want to be walking through my neighborhood with my best friend again laying down in the grass at the park letting the sun hit my face as the breeze cools me off. I just want to be content again. I just want to be able to enjoy things again. ",

      "selftext": "Hello. In order for you to understand, i kinda have no choice but give you part of my life story... so I'm sorry if it's too long.\n\n\n\nSo... i'm a french lad, 23 Years old, and I basically feel like i've wasted my whole life. And I'm so tired of having to confront society and a work environment (that's basically required to live at all) that I just want to end it. Every night i cry to sleep, I feel like a fucking failure but I don't have the energy to fight long enough to make something meaningful with my life.\n\nI've been sensitive and extremely empathetic for as long as I remember, and people who are assertive will always get the better of me because i can't speak up. Been bullied all of my school years because I wasn't like everyone else. I was escaping reality in books and adult conversations, as I was more mature for my age; others it was easy for the others to use me as a scapegoat. I grew used to solitude because over the course of my life i made too little friends to actually be able to rely on them like most would. Many times i suffered from that loneliness. But, even as an adult, my introverted nature and need for understanding and caring friends meant it was extremely hard to make new ones. On more than one occasion I felt genuinely betrayed because a new \"friend\" proved to me that I would always give more to people than they would give me. I'm always here when people need me. But the opposite is NEVER true. And... that hurts. Add to that, most people already have their circles of friends by the time they leave high school. I got two real friends but neither are available when I need them (they can be but when i need them, i would need them to stand by my side every night and they live far from me now and have a life of their own and i just can't ask them that.)\n\nAfter high school i went for economic  bachelor in a public uni, dropped out on the second year because it was too hard for me. Then I took a gap year to write a book (that's how i managed to get my parents to let me do that), but the pressure i put on myself just made me procrastinate for the rest of the year so I ended up not writing anything. (I love writing and I'm VERY good at it, but can only do it in short bursts and when I have no pressure whatsoever on me... which doesn't happen, ever.). After that I went for an illustration school, (because i love illustration but kinda SUCK at it), then BURNED OUT AGAIN the second year without having made any really meaningful progress on my drawing skills because i was stressing and procrastinating too much on the homework, yet i added a student debt to my name which i'm supposed to start paying back somewhere in the next two years. After that I was really KO and decided to go in the wild, in scandinavia, with no knowledge or money whatsoever, just a backpack, a tarp, hot clothes and 500euros to the name. I travelled for six months but was so tired i ended up staying at people's houses for weeks before taking off to get back on the road (i was hitchhiking at the time). When I came back I felt like travelling was the only way I wanted to live, the only way I felt the closest I ever felt to freedom, so I decided to buy a van to be able to travel where I wanted to go and basically work half the year/be on the road being able to write or paint and such the other half. I found work in a restaurant as a waiter at the time, for 8months, and it was bearable because at the time i was living with my best friend for this year. Then I took off to Ireland with the hopes to land a job as a waiter there; Ireland being the only place in Europe I could work as a french in an english speaking setting (i like english a lot, but UK is off-limits for working visas and Canada is too far from my little brothers). I spent ALL my savings settling in (it was really hard finding work that didn't treat me like shit and the rent is crazy (as in, literally crazy)), but ended up burning out after the fifth hunt for a job because in the ONLY nice place i could find that wanted my services, two dicks on the job used me as a scapegoat for something i didn't do because they didn't like me and wanted me gone... The problem is they were on good terms with the head manager, and I was not. I ended up coming back to france after 6months, tail between the legs, ruined and broken inside yet once more. My mom is broke so I can't ask anything of her. I let my dad help me, and he is currently paying for a two-months rent in my hometown. The problem is that 1) my hometown is a place i hated all my life, trying to find ways to get away from there as it is a depressing place; 2) my dad also cares for my two 17year old brothers who are about to enter studies and are going to need financial aid; 3) everything i take from my dad he will make me pay later, one way or another knowing him and 4) as of right now i would need MUCH more than two months to get better...\n\nSo, here we are: I feel like I failed everything the whole way through (oh yeah did I mention I burned out the last year of high school too?), and everytime I have a big project or something i want to prove to myself or to the world I just fail miserably. Right now, i am drained of all life force, I don't know how i can keep putting on a mask to work two days a week but I am, and it leaves me empty and inhumanely tired the remainder of the week. The only way to live in this world being having money which i can only earn with minimum wage job, I feel hopelessness. I don't have the energy to fight anymore, and the mask the society asks me to put on every day is more than I can bear. My body is breaking down, and the mere thought of going to work the next day makes my eyes fill up with tears. I'm a creative person who had a lot, I want to make music, to draw, to write, but i see no way of finding the time and the freedom, let alone to heal and recover from all this shit, but actually practice enough that I would get good enough at these that they might actually allow me to live from them. I feel like every choice I make is wrong. I feel like I never belonged in this world where most people lack the most basic empathy. I'm tired of suffering all the time, and I'm getting really close to seriously considering options like carbon monoxide poisoning...\n\nSo this is it.\n\nThanks for reading the whole way through if you have. It means a lot to me.\n\nIf you have any advice, experience to share... I'm taking.",

      "selftext": "Before I start this, I want to emphazise that I am not looking for relationship advice, I just need somone to vent to, but don\\`t know who irl for now, so the internet it is.\n\nSo last week I was at my partners house and he owns some firearms. Including one blank gun that he always carries. Now if you are like me, you may assume that this type of gun cannot harm you, but I have seen the corpse of an animal he mercy killed with it, so yes, it is absolutly dangerous to point it at a person.\n\nNow my partner also has some mental issuses and is very insceure, so I often have to confort him. One night he has a huge fit talking about how I am probably just pretending to love him and am bad and will leave him like \"just like everyone else\". Mind you, we didn\\`t even have a fight to bring this on, he will sometimes just get like that suddenly. So I try doing the usual stuff to comfort him, but nothing works. Then he says he needs his gun to comfort him and goes to retrive it, then lays back down onto the bed. I try again comforting him, but then things start making a turn for the worst. I can\\`t remember the whole thing my thoughts are all jumbled, but he started doing things like choking me (hard). Telling me that if I truly loved him I would take off my panties, putting knives to my body, but not cutting me (except for one tiiiiny cut) and as I said in the title, pointing his gun at my forehead point blank. But before he does that he tells me to close my eyes so I wouldnt know whether or not he had put any bullets into the gun ( he admitted that that was his attempt later on)\n\nI just sort of fawned the whole time, and with a gun at my head told him, that I know that he would never shoot me (true but only because he wouldn\\`t want to lose his acess to weapons) and that he was only trying to push me away, because he is convinced that I will leave him and is feeling helpless, which is why he is trying to \"get some control back\" by trying to make me leave instead of just \"letting\" it happen. up to now he had been sort of putting on a \"look at me I am so evil\" type persona while harming me, but hearing this his face contorted as if in pain, and he told me \" I hate that you are a psychologist\" ( I am not, just a student of psychology) and put the gun away, which tells me I was right.\n\nThe next day was horrible. my body clearly did not take the evening very well, my throat was hurting incredibly so and I had trouble staying awake despite sleeping for more than ten hours. I decided that if I was going to break up with him, it wasn\\`t save for me to do so at his house. Today is my first evening back at my place. Still not sure how I want to proceed and if I break up with him, if I would be save at campus ( we both live on campus)\n\nAgain I am not asking for advice, I know most people will tell me to leave etc. I am just writing this down to get it out of my head/ get my thoughts straight before doing anything\n\n(Also sorry if my post reads really badly, this is not my first language and it is my first time writing a long post on reddit)",

      "title": "I got a sign from God and ignored it",
      "selftext": "I (25 F) got a sign from god when I was 17 and ignored it. I grew up in a household who claimed that we were religious but we never practiced it. I was baptized and went to a kindergarten in a Lutheran church but never regularly went to church services and god was not mentioned too much in our home. In high school I went through a phase of being extremely curious to learn about religion and see if it was something that I truly believed in. I would attend church services with my friends who were in religious families and did tons of research on various religions in general. After about a year of being in this phase I grew out of it and concluded that I did not believe in god or any specific religion.\n\nAbout a year later I was in the summer of going into my senior year of high school. I was signed up for an art class where we had to sketch in a journal as summer work. I would drive to various places in my town to get inspired by nature and sketch. One day I was sitting on a dock at a lake sketching in my journal by myself. The lake has many walking paths that frequently have people on them. As I was sitting there a person (looked about 30 M) and a young child (looked about 5 M) walked up to me. I forget the exact details of how the conversation started but it turned quickly into conversation about religion. This person was preaching the word of god, going off on tangents about god being present with us and why he is so important. I just smiled and nodded and tried to keep my eyes on my sketch book. Then the person stopped and asked if I believed in god. I said \"no, not really\" which sent this person into another speech about how important it is to believe. He tried convincing me to believe and asked again, \"do you believe now?\". I should have said yes and allowed him to move on. But I'm stubborn and told him \"nope, I still do not believe\". Then this person changed his tone and became very serious. He promised that we would ask god to send me a sign. Once I receive the sign it is important that I believe.\n\nFinally the person and his child walked away and I took a big sigh of relief. I turned back towards the lake and stuck my bare feet into the cool water. I was about 5 minutes into continuing to sketch when at my feet a dead fish rose to the surface of the water. This fish surfaced about an inch directly in front of my toes. I quickly pulled my feet out and scrambled to stand up on the dock. My heart was racing and in my bones I could feel that this was the sign. The person and child were gone and no one was around me. I grabbed by stuff and got the heck out of there. For the following days I played around with the idea that it truly was god and if I should re-consider my beliefs. However in the end I chocked it up to a freaky experience and did not change who or what I believe in. Today, I still am not a believer but every now and then I wonder if I missed out on that sign and why it came to me.",

      "selftext": "This happened literally like 10 minutes ago, I'm sobbing non-stop in my room. We just came back home from a hike, and I got in the shower as I do everytime after coming back home. I have the habit of showering looking at the glass door, and when I looked at the window's reflection I though I saw something moving, but it has happened before and they were just birds, so I didn't really think much of it for a second. For some reason I had the gut feeling to keep looking, and soon enough a full ass phone appears in the reflection. My mother was in the kitchen, my brother was the only one outside. I immediately called him out, he said something but I couldn't listen because I had music on. I turned it off as I could and my mom came knocking at the door, I immediately told her and she went to yell at him and look into his phone (she just told me she found nothing, but I know for a fact what I saw was that). I feel nauseous and like I can't stop shaking. I always saw him as my baby brother, and he seemed to always look up to me. I'm disappointed, disgusted, and absolutely heartbroken, but I also know that from now on I have no brother. I don't know what to do, though. I don't know if I should just ignore him for the rest of my life, or if I should do something else, but I don't have the means to move out at all, I'm a full time student. Some advice would definitely be appreciated.\n\nEdit 1: We have talked to him, repeatedly, as a family, of sexual harassment, puberty, etc. We've been pretty open and clear, and he receives sex ed in high school. My mom talked to him, and he admitted he was aware of what he was doing and that he's ashamed.  My father is going over every device at the time of this update. I already had a panic attack but I'm calmer now. Thank you for the comments.\n\nEdit 2: I talked to my best friend and she told me I could stay with her in her apartment for as long as I needed to. I honestly don't really know. On the one hand, I feel like I'm spiraling being in the house. On the other hand, I don't want to leave my room, if that makes sense. I'm pretty confused and I'm honestly just trying to distract myself with some stuff pending from uni so I can decide tomorrow with a \"clear\" mind. Also, I guess a part of me is worried of what my father will say about it, because he's the one that's always payed for everything and told me I should only study in the meantime (which, honestly, hugeee privilege thankfully) so I'm kind of scared that he'll say I'm over reacting and stop sending money (I rely on him financially, so does my mom) if I stay at my best friend's for a while :/ Anyway, thank you all for the pieces of advice and for your words <3 and to that one person saying it's normal for a 13yo to react that way, fuck off and get yourself checked in the head.",

Her Dad is with my Mom we hang out with eachother i really like her just so u know she is the complete opposite of me she doesn’t look like me at all. She is taller, blond , her body is more thinner than my body also she is has different proportions than my. I had a boyfriend and we have been together for 1 month but known eachother for 3 Years.\n\nHim we call James Her we call Maddy\n\nJames and I started to hang out again after along time after a few months he got to know Maddy. At first eveything was normal but the more he got to kno Maddy the more i felt like he liked her more than me. It started small even tho she didn’t talk to him or about he, he look over to her eventho i was talking to him he always look out for her more than for me i feel like. Maybe this is crazy but we hug eachother and he hugs her everyone they see eachother and i get so mad because of this. One time we talked about this and he told me i will never hug one of his friends eventho they are his brothers and he loves them. I told him then he shouldn’t be doing that either but he said it’s different for her!???? One time we were outside together so maddy james and me he only talk to her until i just stop talking completely then he told me i was acting weird. Maddy drove us home then and i cried in his bed but he didn’t notice. I just don’t know today happen something that made me question everything. We talk about adults movies he told me he didn’t watch them anymore which is good but then i asked what girls he watched beforehand he did not want to tell me and didn’t give me a reason why. After i just said they just didn’t look like me that’s why he won’t tell me after that he said nothing. He told me good night and went to sleep i cried he is still on the phone but asleep while i write this. The thing is he was watching girls on tiktok whom look like her, just not like me in any way. I’m so insecure because of this i always try not to cry but it’s so hard because i see the way he looked at her when she talks how he always talks about her asks about her when she text him over my phone i tell him to stop but he just said he will do it just because he wants to i was so pissed he always tells me i’m overreacting but i’m so sure i’m not i try to keep them as far away from eachother as possible but its hard without neither of them noticing. When we fight he doesn’t tell me why he is mad nooo he goes to her and tells her what i did wrong and she tells me then because he won’t talk to me. He talks to her when we fight and ignores me completely idk what’s happening i don’t want this and i’m scared. Why is he doing this why i just don’t understand why??? Just as a note he doesn’t do this with my of my other friends only with her.\n\n\n(this is my third language so pls don’t judge my grammatik or anything else) ty",

      "selftext": "I was looking for a new dress for an event coming up because I don't have anything suitable at the moment. As I was walking around the shops I felt quite repulsed at the sheer amount of clothing that was in for the new season and the poor quality of it all. \n\nI buy maybe a couple new items a year to replace old ones or if I need something for a particular purpose. I check second hand places first. I grew up a little poor and so we never bought more than we needed and would repair things where possible. I buy mostly for practicality and try to avoid certain places known for really bad quality, because I know it won't last. I do this even though I have the money now to buy more if I wanted to.\n\nWalking around shops looking for a new piece of clothing gives me such an icky feeling. Knowing what the clothing industry is built on, especially fast fashion brands, and the waste that it generates and the people it exploits. \n\nI understand that a lot of people love fashion. It's how they express themselves and buying new things makes them feel good, but does it not feel bad to some extent? Do most people not feel any guilt at all buying new clothes from these places? A part of me does wish I could be a little more careless so that I could dress a little nicer, but it's so disheartening to see people so readily fuel these industries. To see people excessively buy new clothes and throw things away instead of trying to repair that little tiny hole.",

      "selftext": "Get your popcorn ready.\n\nYears ago i met a woman. She was perfect, she was the kindest, nicest, most special, most beautiful person i ever met. She was beyond perfect. We got to talking and became friends. A few weeks later i asked her out. Rejected. \n\nThen i got dragged into a friendzone for 2 years. She became my best friend, shared secrets that ive never shared with anyone, talked near daily. Probably the best friend i ever had and was the happiest time of my life. \n\nThen i realised that i wasnt trying to be her friend. I was still holding on to hope that i could be with her. Although i hadnt realised it, she was destroying my mental health. Then AFTER i realised what i was doing, it started destroying it more. \n\nThen i tried to break it off about a year ago but i missed her. Not only romantically but as a friend too. She was the only person i could truly vent to. So i kept flip flopping back and forth, coming back, breaking it off. \n\nThen about a month ago i asked her if we could hang out. This wasnt the usual hangout where we bake or shittalk or play games. This was the final break off. \n\nI came over, started telling her about my new \"crush\" who we are mutual friends with, although shes better friends with my new crush. Since she knew her better i asked what i could do to make it work. I was talking about how i wanted my new crush to join me on my dream of moving to the USA. \n\nThen she told me that my new crush had a basically complete opposite dream in life. So in an indirect and very kind way she told me \"it aint gonna work\" so i quit that. That was only our first topic.\n\n The next topic was about why we cant be friends anymore. She understood and this was a very calm and healthy conversation that we had. Then i said i thought i was over it and that we might be able to be friends again and how we should hang out again next week. \n\nThat plan for next week kept getting delayed from both of us being busy and then one night, about 2 weeks later i was laying in bed and i realised i do miss her and im not over her. So i texted her \"lets hang out one more time and this is ACTUALLY the last time. Promise me that no matter what, you wont let me be friends with you again\" and then she said ok. \n\nI still couldnt fall asleep. I was thinking about her. Then i changed my mind. I said \"yknow what nevermind. Not even one more time. Goodbye, were out of eachothers lives like a fart in the wind\" and thats the last time i spoke to her.\n\nBut i still think about her and how we should have been together and how perfect our lives would have been. We fit together like peas and carrots. And im not sure ill ever find anyone like her again. Sure, ive had other cruahes but they were all different. They all had their own downsides and doubts on if i really liked them. But not her. \n\nI wish i never met her so i wouldnt have fallen so deeply in love and now that its over i feel like theres a part of me missing. And i dont know if that part will always be missing.\n\nAnd thats what brought us here. I was thinking about her a few minutes ago and i couldnt vent to anyone other than reddit.\n\nExcuse my horrendous grammar, its past midnight. \n\n\n\nTL;DR\n\n1. Like girl\n2. Friendzone for 2 years (became best friend i ever had)\n3. Think not in love, but in love \n4. Break off \n5. Still think about her. Sad. She was more than perfect.\n6. Not sure if i will find another like her.\n",

I really loved driving, working on cars, talking to people, being active. Now everything is just okay. I basically have no friends anymore, my last relationship pretty much exactly a year ago. I can't really get myself up to clean my flat. My live is only, eat, sleep, work. I cannot even really drive somewhere, because my two cars aren't registered. Didn't have the time to do so. \nStrangers on the Internet always tell one to get out there, but when? When I come off of work I'm so tired that I can only sleep. And the days when I could do something I'm working on a car on the side. Weekends too. It feels like I'm too drained to even really engage with people anymore. All my mind thinks about is: I need to clean my home, I have this client that I need to get back to, I need to do this to be able to register one of the cars, there's this problem I need to find a solution, I should really call a doctor for my wrist and toe. All while hating being lonely. \n\nI feel like I'm trapped in my current life. I wish id be able to just have the money now to fly to Australia, travel around that country and get new experiences as a mechanic and person. But at the same time I'd loose an amazing job that I have here. And who would look after my car that I have an attachment to. \nBut still feels like it's the only real way out of my situation. ",

The great thing about her is that she is as enthusiastic to plan and make time for our dates. She is not playing games. She is not trying to be hard to get. She is spontaneous. The dates I have had with others have left me feeling that I needed to do everything and be met with mild interest. She is funny and intelligent and we could talk for hours. Then I invited her to my place and she seemed very happy to come over. I asked her to meet for dinner first then we walked to my apartment. She took one look and said wow I never think about how poor people can be. Then she chuckled and said something about herself being out of touch sometimes called herself a moron and then she strutted off to the couch and made herself comfortable. I stood there frozen. I am middle class and my apartment is in a good part of town. It is very small yes but I own it. I felt very emasculated. The thing is that she seemed to not have meant it in a bad way. She was very happy to be there. We watched a movie and I was nervous the whole time because I wasn’t sure I would be able to preform but she was too damn beautiful so it went well I guess. Now she invited me over next weekend. I am not sure I am going. I guess we are from very different worlds and I am not sure we mix.",

      "selftext": "Alright, here's some context to preface this post: My mother and I(28M) live together in a shared apartment as equals, or as roommates if you will, we both do our share and pay the bills together. I work a comfy job and i like the people i work with. \n\nHere's what I need to get off my chest since this is the only place I'd feel comfortable sharing this: my mother has issues: ever since i was born, she went deaf in one ear and thinks she's being spied on and tracked after she's had an operation. Basically,  she thinks there's a spying device in her ear. \n\nShe is also a very religious person in her own way, believing in the likes of God and Satan. To her, most good things come from God and everything bad comes from satan. This, mixed her paranoiac belief that she's being spied on, is slowly rotting both of our lives. \n\nIt's gotten to the point where she gets suspicious of anyone who remotely looks at her funny or anyone that happens to be outside when she is. she also takes many \"precautions\" to either avoid being seen by \"them\", such as: blasting music or static in her ear or checking around our apartment block for any of \"them\".\n\nThat's just scratching the surface, but I'll stop there, you probably get the picture. You can imagine how this affects my life in many negative ways. i love my mom and i want the best for her, but this lifestyle is slowly draining me. The thing is, she's mentally aware enough to know  that if she were to talk about these things to others, she'd be seen as crazy. that's where I come in, i am the only one she confides to about these things.\n\nI just want a normal life, but i don't want to just ditch her and leave her alone in this. I've already considered professional help, but in the end, she'll see it more as a betrayal than a helping hand. I know that i could just think about myself and move away, but i just can't bring myself to do it...\n\nDespite living a very comfortable life, i feel like I've stagnated, I've given up on even trying to find romance because i don't want to burden whoever would like me with this, not to mention the lack of privacy since we live in an apartment.\n\nI don't know what to do anymore and i don't want to snap at her, but the more this keeps up, the more i struggle. i just end up finding quiet times at work or home to cry alone...\n",

Now however i feel unhappy that i’m not in the relationship. I miss her hugging me, i miss being with her until 4am, i even miss her annoying me all the time. I feel lonely and feel the need to fill that hole with something or someone. I’ve been writing stuff to her on my notes app just talking about my day and stuff, usual conversations with her type. She’s reached out saying she wants to see me since when we broke up we didn’t end on bad terms. She understood everything i was feeling and wanted no hard feelings. I don’t want to see her in fear that I will undo all the “healing” i’ve done up to this point.\n\nYesterday however i was missing her especially so and ended up texting her, basically saying i wanted to see her. It was 2am and honestly i thought she was asleep. Before i could delete my messages she responded saying she was ok with seeing me and we texted for a good 15 minutes after that. The conversation hurt because she texted me like a friend calling me “my dude” and stuff. It gave me the wake up call that I’m never getting what we had back either way we both left the door open when we broke up. I miss her but i know it’s not the greatest idea to go back since i’m just going to have the same feelings i had when i was in the relationship. I do really miss her now that i’m out of the relationship however.",

      "selftext": "We’ve been together almost 9 years, engaged for a bit over 2, living together for 4. We met back in high school through a mutual friend, grew up side by side, and have shared basically our whole adult lives.\n\nLast year my fiancée fell into a financial spiral after losing her job. She hid it from me out of fear, and by the time I found out, we were already in pretty big debt. Things are stable now and we’re paying everything off, but it’ll take another year of tight budgeting.\n\nThere’s also this layer of imbalance between us now. I earn almost three times more than she does. She did find a new job after everything, but it’s basically a dead end - no growth, no clear career path. She says she just needs more time to recover mentally before she starts looking for something better, but deep down I can tell she’s stuck.\n\nIt feels like she’s paralyzed by the fear of failing again. I’ve tried to encourage her, to push her a bit, to tell her she’s capable and should take control of her life, but it never works. I’m starting to think she might just stay in that \"comfort zone\" for years, and I don’t know how to deal with that without sounding like I’m judging her.\n\nSince then, something in me shifted. I don’t feel the same affection anymore. I’m not physically drawn to her (most of the times), our conversations feel shallow, and I often catch myself imagining leaving and starting over. When I see happy couples, I get this sinking feeling that I’ve lost that connection.\n\nShe clearly still loves me. I can see it, and when she asks what’s wrong, I tell her nothing’s changed because I want to believe that myself. We’ve always had a great bond and shared interests, but after that whole situation, I can’t seem to rebuild my trust or emotional attachment.\n\nI don’t know if this is something that can be fixed, or if it’s just the end of a chapter I’m too scared to close.\n\nI really want to be happy with her. I know we could have an amazing future together - we’ve built so much already. But I’m scared that the way I feel about her now will never change, that this emotional distance is permanent, and I’ll keep pretending until one day it all falls apart.",

      "selftext": "I (24m) am having to acknowledge and come to terms with the fact that I actually am sexually frustrated and am having to find ways to deal with it. I have never gotten laid before and I've never dated a girl not once in my life either. And before you try to judge me by calling me an incel or a loser who needs to go touch grass, Im actually a pretty busy person. I'm working two jobs now, I run and sometimes run with running groups around my neighborhood, I do taekwondo and I'm also very spiritual, which means I'm into meditating and tarot cards and stuff like that.  So I have a life. Every other week or so I like to go to bars and clubs to try to approach women to spark up conversations, gain some self confidence and improve my social skills. Because I don't want to be almost 30 years old and still a virgin who's never dated a girl. I don't want to be seen by others as that weirdo in his late 20s/early 30s who's still a virgin and never been with a girl before who's probably gay or something, so I'm trying to take action, out myself out there, gain some self confidence and keep a positive attitude while I'm at it, which takes a lot of conscious effort because approaching a girl or a woman in public, even at a bar or a club can be very intimidating and it takes guts to push through that. I already feel like a loser because I'm already 24 years old never dated a girl before and am still a virgin. I live in a college town and literally everyone in my age range and even younger all have boyfriends and girlfriends. I can't help but feel like a loser. I live by myself in my own one bedroom apartment, I have no family or friends around because both of my parents disowned me so I'm pretty much on my own out here having to fend for myself. \n\nI've also been hypersexual pretty much my whole life and my hypersexuality and sexual frustration has caused me to make stupid decisions such as blowing up my money at strip clubs. I spent a lot of money impulsively on lap dances at a strip club last night which, now reflecting on it, made me realize how sexually frustrated I actually am. \n\nI could use some genuine advice on how to overcome this obstacle. I'm in need of deeper connections with others, especially women. \n",

Very few actually know that actually they need to get better.\n\nThe real reason behind most of our problems lies within us. Harsh but the truth. Once this fact becomes hard to accept, frustration builds up and then anger builds up. You slowing start to rage, you dart destruction. And that’s when we start creating even more problems for ourselves.\n\nIt’s a cycle Rage to problems, problems to rage. How to get out of this cycle?\n\nOnce you realize your in this cycle, its wayy easier to get out of the cycle.\n\nSo always reconsider your decision before you act.\n\nWhy am i writing this?

      "selftext": "Adding a content warning for violence just in case.   \n  \nI'm a mother of two children, both adults now and I deeply regret having my son.\n\nWhen he was younger we knew he was different and he was diagnosed with level 3 autism when he was 4 years old. He's always been nonverbal and had several special needs we accommodated; however, he was a very sweet little boy until puberty. At 14 he began to be destructive, punching holes in walls, screaming, throwing objects at me and his father, and worst of all in my opinion, he began attacking his sister.\n\nMy daughter is honestly the only reason I don't consider myself a failure as a mom. She's 18 now and going to university on a full tuition academic scholarship studying animal science. The university she attends is only a 30 minute bus ride away from our home so she lives with us to save on rent. She was born when our son was five and met her physical milestones behind schedule. However she knew all of her colours by 7 months and all of her letters and their sounds by 15 months. She even knew her numbers up to 50 by the time she was 2. She was reading at a 3rd-grade level in kindergarten. She is smart, and we considered enrolling her in the gifted programme several times but chose not to because we thought it might make her social struggles worse. My daughter has level 2 autism and still has some significant struggles socially and requires some substantial support. She goes to occupational therapy once a month to help her with her social behaviours and to help her deal with her discomfort with change and sensory issues. She has come a long way and is able to communicate what accommodations she needs. She has friends online, and she plays games at the local game store and though she had a hard time dating, she has a girlfriend that I know she adores and that loves her back.\n\nMy daughter and son couldn't be more different. My daughter needs a hug and high heels (toe walking) to feel safe and comfortable. My son breaks plates if the dehumidifier is on.\n\nI've reached a boiling point today. Here in Canada, Thanksgiving is next week, and we've been getting everything ready to get together with my family. My husband is an only child, and his parents come to our get-togethers and holidays. My daughter had come up from our basement, which we had converted into a studio apartment for her, to talk about what she could contribute for the table and what she could help with. Her phone started vibrating on the table and that was enough to set my son off. He hit my daughter so hard she almost fell over. She now has a black eye and has gone downstairs to be away from my son.\n\nMy husband is furious and I know he feels the same way I do. We sent our son to his room and my husband is downstairs with our daughter. I can hear her crying as I'm typing this and it's killing me. I hate my son. I hate being his mother. I wish he was never born. I wish I was only my daughter's mom. Then maybe I wouldn't regret being a parent.\n\nMy daughter deserves a safe place to live. She deserves parents who love her and don't have to worry about a toddler in a grown man's body. I regret being her mom too. I regret it so much because she deserves to live a life without walking on eggshells. If I could have a do-over I would still want to be her mom. Just not his. I would be a better mom and a better person if he didn't exist.",

      "selftext": "\nI met Anna ( name changed )  in Indonesia in May 2025. We clicked so fast, so deep, it was like the universe shoved us into each other’s lives. She was my girlfriend, not just some crush. I found home in her darkness. I carried her pain like it was my own. She was the first person who ever made me feel seen, like I wasn’t just surviving.\n\nOn 25th August she said, “we break up.” No warning. Then on 13th September she blocked me everywhere. That night I just sat there scrolling, rereading our chats, thinking of every “maybe” – maybe it was because I asked for a few minutes in the car to listen to music, maybe because I forgot to call back, maybe because I was too tired – all the maybes tearing holes in me. She even told me “I have a new boyfriend” to shut me up. And then later she said it was a lie.\n\nAnd then on 2nd October she came back. And then that line. “Hufff it turns out I love you.” Like it was casual, like it wasn’t everything. And suddenly I was back in that whirlpool. I tried keeping it light. I tried being just friends. But my heart… my stupid, stubborn heart… fell for her again. Harder this time. Faster this time. And now… I’m not just in love. I’m consumed. I see my future with her. I can’t imagine life without her. Today she literally said it again “as friend.” And here I am, back where I started, trying to be okay with scraps of conversation when all I ever wanted was her.\n\nI wrote her once, when she had me blocked. I poured everything out: that I loved her selflessly, more than I’ve loved anyone, maybe even more than myself. That maybe my karma was just to show her what love feels like, to be the light at the end of her tunnel. I told her how much it broke me seeing her disgust when I commented on her live. I told her she is my kryptonite, that no matter how much she hurt me I would still care. That my job was to love her and I did. I told her how unfair it felt that instead of talking to me, instead of working through the hard times like a team, she just broke things off.\n\nI meant every word. When she said “I’ll accompany you till you find the woman you can marry,” my answer was “I don’t want anyone else. I want you. I don’t want to marry anyone if it means I get to live with you till we die.” And I still mean it. Even with the long distance. Even with the religious differences. Even after everything.\n\nAnd yet I’m also human. I also deserve love and happiness. I grew up in a house where love was conditional, where if I wasn’t doing things their way I was degraded and berated. I’ve been so close to giving up. All I wanted was someone who would understand, who wouldn’t add to the stress, who would help me be strong. And for a moment I thought I found that in her.\n\nI gave her things I’ve never given anyone else. I hope she still wears the jewelry I gave her. I hope she keeps Chocho and Blu by her side. I can’t bring myself to delete a single picture.\n\nAnd now I’m here. Back in love with her. She feels like home. I don’t just love her, I see my future with her. And I hate that I’m this vulnerable, but I also know it’s because I haven’t felt this way with anyone else.\n\nI’ve been trying to learn. That love should be selfless, without expectations or attachments. That everything is temporary and only the present exists. That we’re all dust in the end. But god, it’s hard. Because right now the present is me loving a woman who broke me, lied to me, blocked me, and still somehow feels like the only person I want to build my life with.\n\nI don’t hate her. I love her. I care about her. I wish her nothing but the best. If she wants to be in my life, I’m open. If she doesn’t, I’m open. I’m not a fool. I just believe in things beyond this world, things more powerful than me.\n\nSo here I am. Just a guy who loved a girl in Indonesia, who held her darkness, who still can’t stop loving her no matter how much it hurts. Getting this off my chest because it’s the only way I know to breathe tonight.\n\n\nEvery girls says they want a guy who's honest genuine, fun, loyal etc. But do they? People like me who love genuinely, as a person is. Why are we......fuck why am I always left hurtin'. Why can't I get a gf who I have been dating for a long time and then marry. \n\nFuck I'm almost 22. Yeah ik it sounds like I'm young but if you put life into perspective and say i live till the age of 70. I only have 48 summers, 48 winters, 48 birthdays to celebrate. \nAnd let's be honest. We don't know when we will die. Fuckkk  I am done with this world. I am done with love. I am done with everything. I just want to not exist anymore. Fuck off. \n\n\nPs. This is my 3rd relationship. And only my second long lasting one. 1st relationship lasted 2 weeks - no hard feelings, didn't even love her that much tbh cuz I didn't know her. \n\n2nd relationship was 8 months. Girl was way older (she's 28 rn) asked me to marry her so I can be with her in the same country. I was young and didn't want to marry because what will I say to my parents huh?\nI broke it off with her so yk I was pretty okay. I had my lows but never this bad...\n\n\n",

      "selftext": "I don't have an interest in living, and no one seems to get it.\n\nI have been depressed since I was a child, and I do not remember life without this disease. It got way worse with a trauma i went through at 10 y/o. \nStill, I've had periods of life when I was pretty content and enjoyed my days, but I've basically never felt like life was really worth its troubles. Until high school I wasn't even actively suicidal, just didn't really understand the concept of enojying life itself. In HS, though, I became very suicidal and, now, I've been described as passively suicidal and chronically suicidal. I don’t attempt, I dont have the urge to kill myself, but I think about it at every moment and I know I will commit someday. Im only here because i could never put my parents through the experience of losing a child like this. \n\nThe thing is, I have a few friends and a family that loves me, and even though most of them have also struggled with depression and suicidal ideation, they dont get it. To them, when not in a suicidal state, life IS worth living. They think that the good (not sure what good, but sure) outweight the bad and \"there is so much to do and to see\". \n\nThey think I should try to achieve my dreams (i dont really have any) despite the hardships and the possibility of failure. And, to me, its just not worth it. I dont have a desire to inflict more pain and disappointment to myself, even if at the end I get to do something I really want to. \n\nSo, whenever this kind of topic comes up, I try to explain that I simply have no interest in living life and existing and all that, and they just cant seem to even to begin to understand that. So i just give up. I dont blame them. I know that they make sense and that I am the one who cant function like a human and almost lack the animal instinct to thrive.\n\nI went to college because thats just what you do and i enjoy learning, not because i dream of having a career. I have a job because I am an adult and I have to be able to pay for my necessities, not because i want to get somewhere. I enjoy a few hobbies and i do them to pass time. I have a pet that i love more than anything. But none of that makes life worth living, to me. If a genie appeared and told me i had one wish, i would ask it to erase my existence, because i just do not wish to exist. It isnt just that i want to die, its that i do not want to be alive.\n\nI've done therapy and all that, so I'm not really looking for advice. Just wanted to put this all into words. If anyone else knows this feeling, please feel free to share. Thanks for reading.\n\nEdit: english is my 2nd language, i apologize in advance.",

I'm not really an attractive girl and I have some mental problems but he accepts me as who I am. I also accept him as who he is. He was there for me when I was in my worst state, I was there for him when he was in his worst state. We supported each other always and tried to help each other. I finally found my soulmate. I realized that he's the one that I was dreaming since I was a child.\n\nYesterday I went to see him. I went to see him before many times but this time he asked to kiss me. He asks for permission before touching my arm or hair, and it's a really big thing for me. I knew that if I told him I doesn't want it he wouldn't do it. He respects me. And again yesterday he asked me. I told him yes and he kissed me. It wasn't really a kiss but a peck but still it's really a big thing for me. I didn't think that this time will ever come.\n\nI really love him. I learnt so many things from him. I hope we can last for years and years.

No one wants to hire someone without a degree, trade, or special skill. I have no degree, can’t get an apprenticeship (I’ll make less than I do now and not be able to sustain myself), and have no special skills.\n\nThats not to say I don’t have a job. I have a decent one. I don’t mind doing it, but it’s management that makes it miserable. I make enough to sustain myself if I work overtime and that’s it. The only reason I got the job was because my roommate recommended me. I’ve applied to every single competitor for positions where I do the exact same thing and have been declined for each automatically. Most people in my position need a degree. Not having a degree is the same reason that I’ve been declined from other positions in the same company previously. I’m glad for it now, since many of the positions have been cut. The company has been making “structural changes” or whatever to lower the budget.\n\nEven if I have the time or money to get a degree, I know I’ll just be wasting money struggling through essentially two more years of high school before even touching whatever I’d go into. I know that it’s my fault at that point for not being able to just tough through it. And I’m not 100% sure what I’d get into anyway. I have no inspiration, I have no “calling.” I just do work to get paid and survive.\n\nI have ambitions. Getting a degree is one, if I had the money. I’ve seen the open university courses. I like their natural sciences one. But I know that most jobs I’d get would be in oil or mining, and that doesn’t interest me. I’d like something in renewable or green energy. Or in research. I’d also like to leave the country some day, even if I’m renting for the rest of my life, but I know is also expensive. And I need to be a “skilled worker” to do so, which I am not. I’m unqualified for anything other countries have. I’d also want to be in a safe place, as a trans person. And I’d want to be able to actually have the money and medical access to start transitioning. I also want community, which is not something I have around here. I don’t drink or smoke, so bars aren’t interesting hang outs for me. All the communities around me are geared towards women and I don’t want to impose on that. There’s so many hobbies I’d want to get into, but have no money to start. I’m not sure what else to say. These are kind of just my thoughts so far. Maybe I’ll edit at some point.",

      "selftext": "For context, I (17M) have always been above average in intelligence - after showing high promise with my early milestones I was tested, put into \"gifted\" programs and all of the like. At the same time, I have always gotten in trouble for not sitting still, interrupting, being clumsy and breaking things, not focusing, fidgeting, etc. I also get called lazy a lot. These were only ever comments at parents' evening and in reports, and since I was getting high results at the end of every year it wasn't escalated. Both my parents have been unemployed and living off benefits since I was young, and a lot of pressure was put onto me as their only child to bring the family into a more fortunate position when I become an adult.\n\nFast forward to 2025, I have to take my GCSEs (UK exams everyone takes at \\~16, 10 subjects total). It wasn't that I found the content hard to understand, it's just that every time during the school year I sat down to try and study I just ended up doing nothing no matter how hard I tried. My dad especially put a ton of pressure on me for these exams, he basically told me our entire lives were riding on my success and he didn't know what we would do if I failed. Because of this I basically lived in the library the whole year, which probably gave people the impression I was studying but really I just was staring into thin air and getting distracted by any and everything. Fast forward to August (results day) and I fail most of my GCSEs. My parents didn't really say anything to me but I could tell they were very disappointed.\n\nIn the days and weeks following this my parents started to argue a lot more and shout at each other, fast forward to last week and my father is found dead (suicide). He left a note which explicitly referenced my results and said that he was a failure as a parent. At first my mum tried to reassure me that it wasn't my fault. Fast forward a few days and I get into an argument with my mum and she bursts out with \"well if you hadn't failed your GCSEs we wouldn't be in this mess\". We haven't spoken since then and she can't even look at me.\n\nThe reason I feel so bad is because I know that if I had actually applied myself I would've been able to get very good results and I should have respected how much my parents value education and tried harder. I honestly feel that if I hadn't failed, this would not have happened, and that I should have spoken up about my problems earlier in the year.",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone. I don’t even know where to begin, but all my life I’ve felt extremely unlucky in some way. I’m a 28F from a South Asian family, and this post might be long, but I really need to get it off my chest.\n\nWhen I was a kid, I was relentlessly bullied from ages 7–14. I would hide in the bathroom stalls during recess so no one would see how alone I was. Kids would touch me and then pass my “germs” around as if I was some kind of disease. It didn’t stop there, whenever I visited Bangladesh (where my parents are from), my cousins also bullied me. They treated me like a foriegn alien, while other Bengali Americans I know have nothing but warm, loving memories of their cousins. I’ve never had that. My cousins are all close with each other, but I’ve always been the weak link, the outsider.\n\nMy home life was also toxic. My mom and brother (39M) have infantilized me my whole life. I’ve never really been allowed to have autonomy or a sense of self. My brother was (and is) controlling and emotionally abusive, humiliating me in front of family, yelling at me, belittling me, treating me like a dumb kid even at 28. My sister (42F) was also emotionally abusive. In 2017, she read my diary, found something I wrote out of frustration, and things escalated so badly that she physically attacked me, called me degrading names, and even called the cops on me. I got arrested, had a restraining order, and was forced to stay away from my family for six months, yet everyone told me I had to forgive *her*because she’s older. Even now just a few months ago, she verbally abused me simply because I told her to turn off her 5am alarm.\n\nMy mom has always enabled this. She babied me, gave me no privacy (I shared a room with her until age 27), and never defends me when I’m mistreated. She takes my brother’s side, imposes an 8 pm curfew on me even now, and makes me feel guilty if I’m even a little late. My dad just goes along with whatever my brother says. I can’t even tell my family about my dream of teaching abroad before grad school because they still treat me like a 5-year-old who can’t do anything alone.\n\nAll of this has affected my friendships and relationships. I seem to attract toxic people, get taken advantage of, or end up being mistreated. I get overly attached to people who show me even basic kindness and fall into limerence, so now I don’t have any close friends or dating experiences. I feel like I’ve never had a time where I felt truly loved or deeply happy.\n\nI’ve tried therapy, but both therapists I connected with ended our sessions (not because of me), and I haven’t found someone compatible since. Sometimes the emotional pain is so much that I s\\*\\*\\* h\\*\\*\\*. I feel unlovable and like I was meant to be forever alone.\n\nI’m not sure why I’m even making this post, maybe to see if anyone has had similar experiences or just to finally let some of this out. If you’ve read all this, thank you so much. I genuinely wish you days filled with warmth and happiness.\n\n**TL;DR:** I’m a 28F who was bullied as a kid, mistreated by cousins abroad, and raised in a toxic family that still controls and belittles me. This has left me feeling unloved, unlucky, isolated, and like I always attract toxic people. I’ve tried therapy but haven’t found someone stable. I’m sharing this to see if anyone relates or has similar experiences.",

      "selftext": "Hi Redditors!\n\nI’m in my early 30s, a single woman and a digital nomad. My work revolves around behavioral insights, policy-related research, and exploring less conventional corners of the internet.\n\nIn this dating scene where everything often ends up as a hookup or NSFW conversation, there really comes a point when you start missing having that one constant person and a genuine connection. This era of dating can be exhausting, but let’s not give up.\n\nOver time, I’ve met a few men through dating apps and even some subs here on Reddit:\n\t•\tThe Freeloader. Stayed at my condo for a week, all free, even food. I still cooked for him despite being tired from work. No big deal at first, but he was messy and never cleaned up. I really hate clutter.\n\t•\tThe “First Date = Sex” Guy. He asked for it out of the blue when we met up, even though our chats had been purely SFW before. Total surprise.\n\t•\tThe Married One. We met when I was on vacation in his province. He’d regularly video call me, and I thought it was genuine. Later, I found out his wife was just sleeping in the next room or at work while he called. I unknowingly became a side chick, something I’ve never wanted.\n\nAnd now there’s the current one, who I met organically. He co-owns a restaurant on a popular island where I often work. He’s definitely single; he even requested a CENOMAR to prove it, knowing how traumatized I was from the married guy. He has emotional intelligence. We’ve introduced each other to our families. His sweet mom even checks in on me about my day.\n\nIt’s been a couple of months since they invited me to stay in a unit in the same building as the restaurant so I wouldn’t have to worry about rent and food. In return, I make sure the space feels homey physically, mentally, and emotionally. He’s a “yearner” who misses me when we’re apart, and he’s been consistent with his words and actions.\n\nTo my fellow women who feel frustrated trying to meet a good man, don’t get tired of praying and believing. I still have my doubts sometimes, maybe from past trauma, which is why I stayed lurking here on Reddit.\n\nI’m posting this because I’m about to deactivate my account. I told him everything last night, and the only thing he asked was how he could be transparent too. He’s given me full access to his phone, social media, emails, even bank accounts, not because I demanded it, but because he wants me to have peace of mind.\n\nThank you, Reddit.\n\nNow signing off,\nYour 2026 Redditor Bride ❤️",

Get to know who they are before sleeping with them. If you sleep with them right away, it's mostly physical, lust, and desire. That's not a solid start to a lasting relationship. If it's a good person, they'll want to spend time to get to know you. That quality time is how you learn about each other. Just going straight to hooking up just addresses a temporary fix, that's not a foundation for a loving relationship. In the future, when you meet a good person, the topic of how many people you have been with will come up. Are you going to say I've slept with 40 people. That's gross. People need to stop this weird hookup thing. I thought it was phasing out but still reading about it. Hopefully most are just bots.",

      "selftext": "I’ve been living on my own since February after a horrible 13 year Marriage that I was in. Now I’m trying to take care of my 4 kids by myself. I was abled to save over $10,000 before moving in but it’s basically all gone now due to bills, taking care of the kids and my car going out. I had over $4,000 of repairs. Had to get a lien on it just to afford it, it costed me a month of no car, ruined the chances of me being able to get a promotion at work from being late because of it. Then my ex is really inconsistent with giving me money for the kids. He makes 100,000k a year and sometimes only gives me $120 a week. He knew I had intill the 26th of September to pay my rent or they would double it and waited till that Monday to give me CS because my birthday was the 27th, and he thought I would spend it on myself. Mind you, I’m seeing someone and I didn’t spend ANY money on myself, he paid for everything. And why would I spend any money if I know I have to pay my rent that last day? So now I have to pay September’s rent on top of October’s rent  and since he only gave me $120 and refuses to give me money this week, I’m gonna be 1,000$ short on my rent. I get evicted the 9th this week. And he already told me that he doesn’t want the kids at his place and me either. That I’ll have to “figure it out because it’s my problem.” He doesn’t understand that I put all my money into my car, trying to fix it, for nothing, because it has an engine problem. I couldn’t even get my tags done since my car didn’t pass inspection. Hell my fucking light is late and racked up to over $600 because the water heater in my apartment is bad, and I’m pretty sure that’s what’s running up the bill. I’m just completely fucked. I hate that I have to figure out everything, I hate how I’m the only one supporting my kids and I can barely do it. He doesn’t understand that I have to pay for everything they want or need. And have to juggle things when that happens. I’m just done with everything. Now I have to try to figure out where I’m gonna take my four kids and I. I just hate that I’m repeating a cycle and it makes me feel like I’m my mom. Stuck as a single parent who can hardly take care of her child. I hate that I’m in such a war with him and he wants me to fail so badly on my own. I took him to court but child support doesn’t kick in until January. By then I’d be too late though. I’ve done so many side jobs and sold my damn plasma, called the 211 hotline and reached out to churches and door dashed (which is risky with expired tags and a bad engine) and now I just don’t know what to do anymore. Im still to short and only have so many days left. I’m about to give up. Sorry for the long vent, the only other person who knows is my mom and she can’t help me either. It’s just the most stressful thing when all I want is to make sure my babies have food, power and shelter.",

I used to dislike my legal name, hearing it felt like alarm bells in my ears. Yet now hearing doesn’t make me react negatively anymore, unfortunately that brings me here. I don’t hate it and kinda miss it in a way but im not sure if its a genuine feeling or not. \n My job refers to my chosen name but my manager told the staff my legal name at a work function, it made me feel weird, especially when questions came on why i changed it that they thought it was beautiful sounding and had a sense of music to it.  Now heading over to my parents who never call me my chosen name for their own reasons.  Hearing from them doesn’t hurt anymore either, i don’t know if ive gone numb to hearing it over and over or if i miss it.\n\nIm just curious, if anyone else has gone through this and what they did. Did they go back to their legal name or stay with their chosen name. Did you have difficulty with telling friends and or work?",

It was a full dive experience where you can walk around in a specific area in the sea and interact with the fish that they “tamed” up close. During the dive, the captain used bait to show us an eel and interacted with it. Later the eel bit my mom’s (62f) right thumb and while she was struggling to get it off, the captain pulled the eel off her with its teeth still in her thumb. We had to make an emergency stop on shore and went to the hospital to get her treated.\n\nDue to the incident, she sustained severe injuries because her tendon was severed and had to get two nerve graft repairs but she never regained control of her thumb. She still has severe pain that won’t go away and anxiety about the whole situation. When she tried to reach an agreement with the diving company providing medical documents and financial records, they refused to take any responsibility for the incident and stopped responding.\n\nWatching my mom who is old enough to retire go through such a traumatic experience has been extremely painful and heartbreaking. I wish I could do more for her and I feel guilty that maybe I could have done something to prevent it from happening.\n\nMy mom was planning to continue working for a few more years but now simple house tasks are difficult and painful for her. This incident has caused physical, emotional, and financial distress for my mom and fills my whole body with rage thinking about how insensitive the captain can be about all this. This was difficult to write about and my hands are still shaking but it’s been weighing on my mind for over a year.\n\nPlease be careful out there. At the end of the day, the fish are still wildlife and there are always risks with these activities.",

      "selftext": "It’s my birthday today which is why I’m feeling this so hard right now as it really highlights the lack of effort.\n\nFor context, I (35F) have always struggled with not feeling liked enough or popular enough or that I don’t have enough friends. I think this perhaps stems from being painfully shy when I was younger and so always found it difficult to make friends at school and college and university, despite being an extravert and very sociable.\n\nThroughout my adulthood I’ve strived to constantly make new friends but that is really really difficult especially the older you get.\n\nI have a decent number of friends now, but it sometimes feels like most of them just don’t care about me that much. I realise that some of how I feel is on me and my insecurities and not other peoples’ fault and I’ve explored this at therapy and have been able to challenge these feelings, but on days like today it’s very hard not to feel undervalued.\n\nSo, yesterday I went out for some birthday drinks and few people made it despite inviting a lot. It felt like many of the excuses were a bit flimsy, like really they just couldn’t be bothered. I go out of my way to show up for my friends, and would always turn up for a special occasion like a birthday unless there was a very good reason why I couldn’t.\n\nAnd what’s worse, is that so many of these so called friends haven’t even reached out to wish me a happy birthday. I shared an Instagram story that references it’s my birthday and lots of people have seen it, so it’s not like they might’ve just forgotten.\n\nI get that I’m not the centre of other peoples’ worlds and they have other stuff going on. But surely a simple Happy Birthday message isn’t too much to ask?\n\nI realise this all might sound a bit pathetic and like I’m overreacting in this situation, but this is just one example of instances that have left me feeling like this. \n\nI’d be interested to hear other stories about friends. I need to know if it’s just me, I’m the common denominator after all, so perhaps I’m just unlikeable and repel friends? Or is this just a universal experience because people in general are just a bit shit?",

Over the years, I managed to secure some support so that part of the TNR program is subsidized. That’s about it, beyond that, no one else stepped in. Local shelters are overwhelmed and can’t help.

      "selftext": "My sister and her husband are both incredibly smart people, and they're trying to raise their daughter Amanda to also be really smart, but really they've set their child up to be 'the weird kid'. \n\nThey never baby talked for her entire life. No mama or dada, no lovey's, doggy's, not even a 'yummy' it was always the full words and they had her use full words when talking about anything too. So now they have a 5 year old running around talking like a tiny professor. Which is cute if you're an adult watching them correctly use 'excessive' in a sentence, but makes her stick out among a bunch of other kids who have no idea what it means. It also took her way longer to start speaking at all than our younger cousins or their children. \n\nThe kid is 5 years old, and has never seen any kind of TV that isn't Steve Irwin reruns or used a touch screen for anything. Which isn't necessarily bad, but it does mean that she doesn't know any Disney movie's, she's never seen any bluey, played any games, or anything else that the rest of the class is into and therefore can't join in when they're talking about that kind of thing. It's making her stick out even more. At pick up yesterday just about everyone was singing songs from Trolls and she was just standing off to the side watching. \n\nSome of their test taking is also done on tablets, and she has no idea what to do when she's handed one, and the teacher doesn't seem to know what to do with a kid that needs instructions on how to navigate them. \n\nThis is her first year in a group environment, previously she's always been watched either by family or by a baby sitter, so no day care or pre school of any kind. As a result, this kid is absolutely miserable at school, where not only does she have to fight to get the only adult to pay attention to her, but all the other kids want little to nothing to do with her. \n\nShe sticks out, has pretty much no friends and she really hates it. I watch her for a couple of hours after school let's out until their parents get off work and it's so awful asking how the day went and hearing them describe being left out or made fun of. Now the first kids are having birthday parties and my niece isn't invited to either of the ones happening over the weekend, even though basically the entire class is going. \n\nI really hate seeing her so miserable. I feel like if she'd been in group care previously, or even seen some of the most popular shows or movies a little she would have such an easier time with making friends. \n\nBut I can't say any of this out loud to my sister, or even my parents who like how 'traditional' her up bringing is and constantly go on long winded rants about how technology is killing society and we're all becoming Wall-E. \n\nThere's nothing I can really do but watch her be miserable coming home and it fucking sucks. I can comfort her all I want, but the next day it's all the same. ",

These group video calls aren’t advertised as ‘recorded’ but it just takes one person.\nI’m relatively certain it’s only a matter of time til I’m exposed/outed to everyone I know. I also know how much of a bomb shell this will be because it seems so out of character for me.\nI’ve recently seen my own content on twitter - which happens to be the one platform I DONT post to (because of the above concern). I also know there’s vids of me out there dotted around on random porn sites. \nFurther to the above, I don’t charge money or have a paywall behind any content of me because I feel like I can use that as a defence in case my workplace ever finds out.\nNot sure what to do… but I guess I’ll see how long I can keep up the ruse.\n\nTLDR; seemingly respectable, can’t stop posting my own porn / ? ruining my life \n",

I keep on telling her to stop doing it but she just *keeps on doing it* and it drives me insane.\n\nAnd then she’s always hitting me physically as a joke. I’ve also already told her multiple times to stop hitting me especially in the shoulders/arms since it HURTS but she told me she was just joking and not to take it seriously. And when we walk through campus together she’s always roughly pulling my backpack and it’s almost caused me to fall off the stairs once.\n\nNot to mention how… negative she is all the time and how defensive she gets on everything. I’m not much better as a person than her (infact maybe I’m even worse…) but god she’s so draining to be around. Everytime she speaks it’s almost always her throwing shade on somebody or someone or gossiping.\n\nShe’s always talking about how the other guys I’m friends with suck so much (not for anything actually serious just that they’re ‘cringe’ and like anime like me) And she has something bad to say about all the girls I’m friends with (mainly beef from YEARS AGO that she just can’t let go, and it’s insanely petty things.\n\n• And then she won’t let me talk to most of my friends since she has beef with them too, especially her most recent ex but he’s one of my closest friends too (they broke up due to him being a little too tired and monotone one day. I kid you not that was her reason, she ended up beefing with 2 other girls she was friends with because they realized that she broke up with him purely because he was just tired for a single day)\n\n• On thursday last week she told me ‘if you can’t respect me I won’t respect you’ because I was talking to her ex and I was kinda just silent the entire time she crashed out on me. I know that if I tried to talk to her she’ll just be like a fucking brick wall.\n\nAnd she makes so many suicide and wrist slitting jokes she towards us. She’s always telling me to ‘kill myself’ or kms, or to ‘slit’ (my wrists) and I’ve told her AGAIN AND FUCKING AGAIN TO STOP MAKING THOSE JOKES TO ME AND MY OTHER FRIEND BECAUSE SHE KNOWS WE BOTH SELF HARMED BEFORE AND WE WEREN’T COMFORTABLE WITH IT.\n\nI also told her I’m a diagnosed autistic and that I was uncomfortable with her calling me retarded and slow and whatnot (especially when I stop masking) and she was like ‘okay but you don’t ever care about my dyslexia??? so why should i care about your autism???’\n\n• I knew that she had dyslexia so I always tried to help her especially when it was harder for her to read things in class but she never listens-a great example is from 2 weeks ago when I had to tell her clearly 5 FUCKING TIMES that she was reading the teachers version of a textbook when she was supposed to be reading the student textbook which looks completely different.\n\nAnd she’s genuinely so fucking racist, like I know that these days ‘friendly fire’ or ‘friendly racism’ is more accepted compared to before but SHE’S ACTUALLY FUCKING RACIST. She’s laos & native american and she’s told me that she ‘never says the N-word!!’ and that all the accounts with her saying the N-word are fake but it’s not fake at all.\n\n• Whenever I’m in the car with her she starts saying the fucking N-word constantly and none of her black-friends know and she keeps on telling me to not tell anyone she does it because she knew I kept secrets but I’m so done keeping secrets about it.\n\nAnd the worst part? She doesn’t listen at all. She doesn’t listen to me, she doesn’t listen to my other best friend (who I don’t put in quotation marks since she is in fact one of my real best friends), she doesn’t listen or try to believe that she may be in the wrong in something for once. It’s like talking to a brick wall that only wants to talk about how much her life sucks.\n\n• A very funny but disturbingly ‘insightful’ one is from 5 days ago when I told her cookie run kingdom is a game made in korea and she denied it so damn much until i had to search it up on google for her to see.\n\n• Another is how much she complains about her dating life, and I gave her advice on not jumping into one relationship after the other especially since she barely knows the people she dates and she breaks up for the dumbest reasons (think middle school relationships but with a hs sophomore who thinks she can’t do wrong); and then she complained that I was talking too much and to just listen, but listen is all I do with her.\n\nIk this is a sub for letting things out but this also sounds so stupid to post, especially because I know I’m being an asshole about it. I hope she doesn’t find this post… not like she will since she doesn’t use reddit.\n\ncoming back to this now is insane HOLY SHIT i had SO MUCH to say about her…",

      "selftext": "Just a dream right? No foul no harm done. Yea right...\n\nLast night I kept having too many dreams - colleagues, friends etc. Most of it was nice or neutral. Until THAT dream. I didn't know any of the people in that dream. It was like I was put in a situation among strangers. The person killed wasn't a good person, in fact he was awful. He had been abusing a teenage girl. I found myself head to head with him in a small room. I think I confronted him (details are hazy). \n\nNow, I am by no means a fighter - I'm a 5'4 female but I do watch a lot of action movies lol. I think this is where some of that helped. Somehow, knives got involved and I managed to avoid his lunge and stabbed him in the stomach. I could FEEL the knife going into his flesh - it was revolting. He was dead\n\nThe next part was when it truly hit me. I found myself in a room with the girl, in a room resembling mine, to add to the weirdness. I confessed that I had killed him. She didn't flinch but continued doing what she was doing. Of course she didnt care - I had killed her abuser, right? I broke down thought. I slumped to the ground and started crying. I was inconsolable. I had just taken a life. I was crushed. \n\nI guess my takeaway from this is that I will never understand how people can kill others for nothing and live with it and that I hope I'm never in a situation where I have to take a life. Truly devastating...",

I just genuinely thought I wouldn't come back. Either by drowning myself or jumping off of something. I was going to write a note, but I wanted to just dissapear instead of making anyone worry so I didn't. \nI walked for hours, sat on the farthest end and watched some birds. And then hours later after that I just got up, walked all the way back, and drove myself home. Ive been acting like nothing happened ever since, even if I've been feeling a very similar feeling since yesterday. I feel numb and I dont know what to do with myself. It might have just been the fact that I was so unprepared, because I don't feel any sort of difference of how I see life or anything.

but it’s all important and it all needs to be said. but i don’t know how to get anyone to listen to me.\n\nim autistic and adhd. i just recently found out. and im frustrated because i know its more severe than what people may think. a lot of it is due to how much ive been able to handle myself so well externally. to the point that i dont even fuckin process or feel or whatever physical things well. like my teeth are fucked because i know how poorly ive kept up with them has led to cavities of some sort. all of my wisdom teeth have grown in! and multiple are compacted but i literally just don’t even feel it. i never felt them growing in, i don’t feel them now sitting them crushing all of my teeth together. \n\nextreme TMI: prolapse.\n\ni might be prolapsing or maybe something like that. idk! but i shat blood a month ago. i haven’t since but i am not sure if i feel anything else off down there. i also used to be a chronic pusher when going to the bathroom and have always had monstrous, rock hard poops (sorry). but i’m a 5’2 female who weighs roughly 105 lbs. the fact that i can outshit a burly man on a carnivorous diet is concerning and i think it’s ruined my butthole.\n\noh also i have had shitting issues since like forever. my regular potty time involved enigmas from my mother for years. i can’t fully process my bathroom usage btw ^. i proccess any need or sensation whatsoever to go until im literally ABOUT to go, which ofc has led to accidents even in adulthood :) this leads to extreme backup and constant infant sized shits  to come from my rectum.\n\nit sounds goofy but it’s genuinely apart of the reason why i see no future for me. i can’t detect issues with my kidneys or issues with my heart. i also didn’t realize how fucked up i probably did get from my mom’s pregnancy and birth with me. that’s a different novel but off the bat i was born jaundice and with a hernia, which ofc ik can be normal. but for the conditions i went thru they were a beginning sign to where im at now.\n\ni’ve had multiple head injuries that may or may not have needed to be looked at. someone accidentally tried to close a car trunk door when i was grabbing something, resulting them slamming it on my head. a skating rink bench fell onto my head when i fell off from someone pulling my skate too hard, and it fell with me. i’ve fallen back in my chair sitting right by me rn multiple times, each time slamming my head on my metal bed-frame. but i just get up. i just walk it off. \n\nso many instances of serious falls or injuries but unserious reactions. i’m scared for all the genetic and environmental issues my body may have. and there’s many genetic ones as well trust me. \n\ni can’t do this. because of my conditions i also can’t be in public properly anymore either. i used to mask so well. it was easy growing up, in college dorms, my first year in an apartment on my own truly started my downfall. i got through it to my BA, like i said, but im so burnt out. i cant mask well anymore. i fall completely silent when someone tries to talk to me without meaning to at all. i try to speak and when i do i can’t even form proper sentences anymore. i have a physical block keeping me from speaking.\n\ni haven’t been able to keep up with myself properly. the past two weeks i think i washed my hair three times. i can’t brush my teeth i can’t do anything. the physical block is like all over now. i literally get up, get ready to go and just freeze. i can never make it anywhere in time bc my place of residence is so far from campus and i can’t drive (like i cant. i tried i promise lmao, many times, but i also didn’t realize my depth perception and spacial awareness were so off until i couldn’t tell distance from ppl and cars. and almost hit them every time im out. it’s safer for everyone). so i have to walk or bus, both take extra time i always don’t calculate well. \n\nand like i said i just freeze. time lapses. i get sick of myself and i lie on the floor and miss out on class or whatever else was going on. or i do end up leaving my apartment, im walking there, i literally get shocks and run away and hide somewhere else. it took me like 5 days to be able to go out and pick up my medication. getting dinner from pickup literally made me feel like i was dying and i couldn’t figure out where or what i should do in my environment i couldn’t get out of there quick enough. \n\ni can’t even get myself to go into my kitchen much. thankfully my apartment room has a bathroom. but then that’s also gotten gross lowkey. but yeah i’m petrified to leave, and i genuinely don’t mean that in a cowardly way. i’ve been pushing myself outside for so long and did so well, but so many situations where ive gotten so frightened or had meltdowns i just am stuck.\n\nit’s like ive lost every ability to be a normal, functioning human. i feel so gross and off and tired. but i also can’t feel exactly what it is or why. i can’t verbalize it well enough that i am NOT DOING OKAY. even when i TRY i just can’t SPEAK well enough. \n\nand i can’t type it like this because it’s long and exhausting. what i’m going thru is long and exhausting but i look so NORMAL on the outside that every physical and mental thing going on inside of me is not seen properly.\n\ni 1000% think my needs were much higher than what i have made myself seem like after 22 years of physical and emotional torture and pain and neglect. of never being acknowledged properly or treated properly by my parents. \n\nmy future is bleak and i’ve already seen it. this past summer i was working almost every day as a server. no breaks. had to save up for my bills so i let my manager definitely break many labor laws with me LMAO.\n\nbut i also resorted to sleeping with a man who ended up giving me some money too. that was also a whole situation that was awful in its own right. i won’t get into that. but i don’t have parents money to fall back onto like many ppl around here do. it literally felt like life or death in that moment. it kinda feels like that way now too.\n\ni want to drop out of grad school. i know my limit now. i’m tired of pushing myself. i can’t keep up with the type of environment i would need to make myself kinda perform in for another two years. i’m just tired and i wanna do something just where no one has to think of anyone or anything just focus on their work and then exist and do things i love on the outside.\n\ni also need to figure out my health issues, and what to do with school in the first place. i’ve ignored everyone. im not proud of it. but idk im also tired so idk what else to say. i just dk anymore",

We’ve gotten along very well and have talked just about every day for the past few weeks getting to know each other and even been able to play a few matches if Marvel Rivals and watching Kpop Demon Hunters over VC on Discord.\n\nIn that time, I think I might have developed a crush on them, and I feel so guilty for it and some of the emotions that it’s making me feel as a result. The main thing on my mind all the time is that I feel like I’d be taking advantage of them if I told them that I liked them because of their recent breakup a few months ago. Furthermore, they also had been talking some to their ex recently and have worked out some of their issues and are on much better terms, but I hate that I felt so jealous even though I’d be the first to say that it’s a good thing.\n\nI just feel so lost about it at the moment. With how recent my own breakup was I don’t feel ready for another relationship, but I really care and like my friend and I think they feel the same way but I don’t know. I’ve spoken to my other friends about it and they tell me I should tell my friend that I like them but I’m scared again because I feel like I’d be taking advantage of them, and with my own experience of being taken advantage of by people I thought I could trust I don’t ever want to subject anyone to that.\n\nI’ll probably delete within a day or two, but I don’t know.",

      "selftext": "DISCLAIMER: I don't know if this is the right flair because my ex never interacted with me in person. This story may be triggering due to me being sexualized as a young teen, which is why I put it. If this flair is incorrect, kindly let me know, and I'll try to change it.\n\nThis happened to me 4 years ago right after I graduated middle school. For a bit of context, all of my friends at the time were online friends. I was 14FTM at the time and my ex was an upcoming 17 year old. I asked him out after I admitted to our mutual friends that I had a crush on him. After we got together, we spent nearly every day calling each other.\n\nAbout a month into our relationship, some red flags appeared. Unfortunately I had rose tinted glasses on and also being inexperienced with relationships in general, I failed to notice them. When we were on video call, out of nowhere, he asked me to lift my shirt. I hesitated, but after he pressured me, I reluctantly gave in. Worst part was, I had a bra on that was the same color as my skin. This only continued to progress as he pressured me to strip on call. He'd even strip on camera as well to \"encourage me.\" We would also do sexual RPs with him through text.\n\nEventually we \"broke up\" under the pressure of my dad finding out about this relationship. Nothing changed after we broke up though. He still used me for his own pleasure for 4 months.\n\nIn January 2022, I realized what was going on between me and my ex wasn't okay. I told him to not speak to me and to leave me alone. He didn't. I didn't handled this the best way I could've, but I don't regret it one bit. I told all of our close mutual friends. I'm gonna call them Ryder (15M) Dana (17MTF) and John (16M). (Yes, these were their ages in 2022.) I told Ryder first, and he took it seriously. He encouraged me to tell the others what my ex had done. I told Dana next, they believed me without needing me to show them proof. (I'll put my theory as to why they didn't need proof to believe me in a later paragraph.) I told them I was gonna tell John about it. They offered to tell him for me, but I declined because it was my story to tell.\n\nFor some context, me and John were not on the best of terms. 2-3 months before I told him what my ex did to me, he and I fought over something and didn't speak for a month. I don't exactly remember why we fought, but I remember being very angry with him at first, but when he refused to talk things out, I felt emotionally devastated. Eventually Dana stepped in and tried to get John to give me a second chance. (He hardly did despite us now being in the same Discord server again.) He was also second best friends with my ex. (Dana being his first.)\n\nAnyway, I told him what my ex did, showed him screenshots and all I recall him saying to me was \"Don't get me involved in this.\" The next day, he tells his Twitter followers to support my ex. I saw that tweet and immediately knew it was over for our friendship.\n\nThe next move I remember taking was calling him out in our Discord server. He was playing a game. Once I mentioned the game he was playing after being a little vague, he immediately stopped playing it. (Probably panicking.) To this day, I regret this move the least. I hope it scared him enough to never pull this ever again.\n\nMy memory is admittedly fuzzy when it comes to this part, probably because I knew that the things I did was not the best things to do and I suppressed those memories to make myself feel better after it was all over. What I do remember is what follows.\n\nI celebrated in our Discord server after my ex blocked me on all social media. John dm'd Dana about me going too far, (and after Dana telling me in our DMs,) I called out John for not being man enough to say it to my face.\n\nEventually, John blocked me too. Ryder ended up ghosting me without any explanation (that I could remember.) It was just me and Dana. Dana told me the John now considers my ex as his best friend and not them. (They were best friends since middle school. So it hit hard for them.)\n\nMy personal theory as to why Dana didn't need proof to believe me when I told them what my ex did is that they were already suspicious of him. Apparently on calls with John, my ex would \"talk about some red flag stuff.\" (Dana's words, not mine.) John told Dana, which is why they became suspicious of him. Dana did tell me that John once cared about me and was also concerned, but I think because of what happened before, he stopped caring.\n\nEventually Dana left me behind too. At the time, I thought it was because I was 15 and they were 18. In March of this year, I talked to them again. In reality it was because they didn't think they were doing enough for me (oversimplification, but I'm here to spill my guts out. Not someone else's.)\n\nAnyhow, after I finally got a new girlfriend this year in May (yay!), the memories kept crawling back. I used to get angry, until I heard on a YouTube video that anger lasts for 90 seconds and only keeps going if you refuel it. Now, I don't get angry, I just relive the hurt. I'm seeing a therapist partially about this, but I need to get this off my chest now. 4 years after my ex used me, and 3 years after it all crashed and burned, I still feel hurt and betrayed by both John and my ex.\n\nI appreciate any kind words. Thank you for reading.",

      "selftext": "When I was 17 or 18, I started dating a guy the same age as me. We had been really close friends before, and at the time, I didn’t realize it, but now I think he agreed to date me mainly because I told him I wasn’t going to keep doing things with him (nothing sexual), and he wanted more from me.\nI was always hesitant about having sex because I was a virgin, and so was he. I didn’t want to seem “too easy,” so I decided to wait. He was persistent, constantly asking if I wanted to do something, and I kept saying no.\nOne day, though, I gave in hesitant and nervous. I went down on him, and that was it. At the moment, I thought it wasn’t so bad. But after that, everything started to go wrong. That same week, we went to a party and I got very drunk. I asked him to stay with me that night because I just wanted to cuddle and sleep.\nI was about to fall asleep when he started groping me, touching me under my underwear, even though I had made it clear that I wanted to wait and only wanted to do things to him. I was drunk, and it took me a while to get his hand off me.\nOn another trip together, he pressured me into doing something I wasn’t comfortable with. I told him no, and he got mad, saying that if I didn’t do it, we wouldn’t do anything at all. The next day, he tried to make me feel good, putting a LOT of effort into it. but when it was his turn, he asked me to do the same thing he had pressured me into before. Feeling like I “owed” him, I went along.\nMost of the time, he treated me nicely and affectionately before any sexual activity, but afterward, he’d become cold. He would play on his phone, leave, or just avoid any kind of intimacy. He wouldn’t even kiss me because he thought \"it was gross\".\nWhen he went down on me, he made it obvious he didn’t enjoy it. He exaggerated sighs, rushed me, and made negative comments about my body. I told him he didn’t have to do it if he didn’t want to, and he would just say, “But you like it, right?” My body might have felt pleasure, but I often wanted to cry. I felt trapped, like saying “no” would offend him. Sometimes, when I tried to stop him physically, he would grab my legs harder to keep me from moving and continue.\nBy the end of our relationship, I forced myself to pleasure him, and he knew it. He saw me crying while doing it and didn’t stop, he just asked, “Are you okay?” and that was it. he continued, finished and left.\nI don’t know if I’m exaggerating or not, but this has been eating at me ever since it happened.\n(I'm sorry if my english is bad, its not my first language (ó﹏ò｡) )",

None of those things are true. I loved you, as my friend. I'm proud of my family and love my significant other very much. I get so frustrated when I think of you. When I wonder how you've been. I miss you. You were my best friend.\n\nWe didn't mean to hurt each other, yet we did. We tore a rift between us so far; I know I will never see you again. I think of you as a way to keep the memories; Alive. Vivid. \n\nYour face is beginning to fade, and your voice us but a mere whisper in the back of my mind. I never want to lose the memories we once had. I never want to lose you. You were my best friend. You still are. Even when your silent anger and hatred towards me scream so loudly. My heart breaks every single time I think of you. I just can't let them go.. I can't let you go. I don't want to forget.",

      "selftext": "I’m a 21 year former student, having graduated 3 months ago, and I was studying in Liverpool, UK. I had a great life there, I had friends, hobbies, a good job, independence. I was just so happy, it was a relatively cheap city, even for students and I never had a problem supporting myself at all.\n\nI recently moved back home with my family. My family live in a tiny village in the arsehole of nowhere in the North of Ireland, if you’ve ever been to the northern counties, you’ll know what I mean when I say there is nothing here. Because there is absolutely nothing whatsoever. In my village, there’s one shop and one restaurant that I currently work in. There are two buses out of the village (One at 09:00 and one at 18:00) that go to Lisburn, which is pretty miserable and hollow town as it is. I moved back to the North after I graduated because I couldn’t keep living in Liverpool, my contract for my house had expired and I was unlucky in finding somewhere else to live.\n\nMoving back has broken me. I can’t stay here much longer. My family are making this very hard on me by trying to keep me here, when I really don’t want to. My parents, as good as they are, can be very rigid and once they decide on something being good or bad for me, they do not budge from that position. They’ve decided that I should live with them for the next few years to start my career and get settled into working life, and I couldn’t think of anything worse.\n\nThere are no opportunities for me here, for me to have any chance at a job in the lines of work that would be good for me I would need to work in Belfast, which is a pretty difficult commute. This is to say that in Liverpool, those jobs are much more abundant and easy to access. It’s part of the reason i’m so desperate to leave.\n\nThere’s no reason for me to stay here any longer than I have to. All i’m doing right now is working and saving the necessary funds to pack up and leave Northern Ireland for good. I have no life here, I haven’t lived in Northern Ireland since I was a highly unsocial and lonely 18 year old fresh out of school. Since then i’ve left home and created a great life for myself somewhere else, just over the other side of the sea. It’s right there waiting for me but I can’t be there right now. And it’s just killing me being here because all I do is go to a job I hate and come home. I want to go back to living in the city where I can walk to anywhere in 20 minutes, or take a train and go to another city in an hour or two. Where i’m with my friends, where I have a job I love, where I have my own space and the freedom to be the person i’ve work so hard to be.\n\nI know this is all written horribly, but I just wanted to say this all somewhere, I am very isolated at the minute and have nobody to talk to about this. If you read the whole thing then I appreciate you hearing me out.",

      "selftext": "My (ex) bf and I broke up yesterday… it still hurts so much and yes it’s recent, not even 24 hours have passed but I genuinely feel like dog shit. We were together for almost two years and yesterday would’ve been our 1 year and 9 month anniversary. I didn’t want to break up with him… but I had to..\n\nNow I wasn’t no saint in this relationship, we all have flaws and this year has been, 100% the worst year of my life and I wouldn’t wish what’s been happening to me to anyone, not even my worst enemy. Technically he was my first real relationship and definitely the longest one, I did emotionally “cheat” at the beginning of the year that lasted a month? and I’m not going to justify it because genuinely I still feel like a POS but I did it regardless, no excuse and I’ll accept the backlash for it. However that wasn’t the reason for the break up. \n\nI miss him so fucking much and it hurts so fucking bad, I’m starting to regret it so badly, I can’t stop thinking of him, constantly checking my phone to see if I get a message hoping every buzz I get is him but it’s not. Emotionally and physically, I don’t know how I’ll ever recover from the damage he has done to me, it hurts so much and I’m traumatized. I’m tired of crying and I don’t know what to do, I love him so much and I just wished I knew how to show/express it better while we were together, it was genuinely one of my biggest struggles and I was going to therapy to figure out the “why”.\n\nI’m really just rambling because I literally have no one to talk to, I don’t know what to do anymore, it’s just so hard… I can’t talk to anyone about what he did.. but I still love him regardless.. I’m so alone.. I can’t imagine how he feels… ",
