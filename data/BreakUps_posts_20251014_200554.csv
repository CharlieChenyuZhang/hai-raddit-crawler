1o6w41l,He left me for someone more ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù,"My boyfriend (27M) of 8 years broke up with me (25 F) last year in may for some other chick, because she was more ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù, had an interesting personality and he could ‚Äútalk about anything‚Äù with her. Tbh I should‚Äôve seen the signs. Weeks before the breakup I noticed he was using his phone more than usual but I didn‚Äôt think much of it, but one day I saw his phone getting multiple messages from a name and he was laughing so I asked him if I should worry about it. He said ‚Äúit‚Äôs just a friend from college, I said ok and forgot about it.

In May, he admitted that he kissed her, and after that he started to feel different. He developed feelings for her and wanted to see where that goes. After that I went through one of the hardest periods of my life. Anxiety, depression, sleepless nights, days where I couldn't even get out of bed, I lost weight. I kept trying to talk to him, to convince him, to get him back - but nothing worked.

I would say I‚Äôm not a feminine woman like didn‚Äôt use much makeup didn‚Äôt wear like girly clothes I always love to wear oversized clothes and sometimes more mature outfits which really pisses me off when he said all of those things that he felt attracted to her.

Two of the things that helped me go through all this was watching Game of Thrones and a kitten. My ex had just gave me the kitten days before the break up. having to take care of that kitten helped me to distract myself. I also started to run with my dog and even learned how to drive and got my license. All of that was from me to June and on July I stopped contacting him because it definitely wasn‚Äôt helping.

In August, he reached out to me to see how was I doing if I was OK and it was weird cause he was supposed to be happier with his new girlfriend and stuff. I actually didn‚Äôt wanna talk to him because I was starting to feel a little bit myself back And he kept insisting texting me checking out on me and I would just send him a cold and distant replies. He kept insisting in having a date, but not as a couple, but just as friends which I accepted, and he confessed to me that breaking up with me, what‚Äôs one of the deepest regrets he has ever had because after that everything went downhill with his life, he crashed his car. He got demoted on his job, and of course, the girl he was interested in was for the streets so to speak because she was not what he thought she was. She was a difficult person and was only interested in his money.

And I told him I was happy all that happened to him, he deserved it all for of all the things he made me go through and simply got up and walked away. I was so pissed off, since 
It didn‚Äôt work with her now he wants me back so no. hell no. I finally blocked him that same day.

I am well now, single but not alone. I don‚Äôt think I want to be in a relationship for now, I am just enjoying myself in this new chapter of my life, learning to love me again and not depending on anyone to be accepted.

Later I found out a friend of his told him he (my ex) was stuck with me, because I left college to start my own business and he was supposed to find someone on his level, someone better than me.",JackfruitConfident19,1760486724.0,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o6w41l/he_left_me_for_someone_more_feminine/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o6w41l/he_left_me_for_someone_more_feminine/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False

1o6w1g9,Dreaming about my ex,"My ex and I broke up two months ago now and I‚Äôm starting to feel myself getting over her. I still miss her and feel sad when I think of her but she doesn‚Äôt occupy my mind as much and I‚Äôm starting to look into the future. 
However the strangest thing has started happening and that is she is appearing in my dreams when I sleep. For the past two evenings I‚Äôve dreamt that we were still together and for both of them I seemingly force myself to remember we are no longer together. When I remember we aren‚Äôt together anymore in the dream it‚Äôs almost peaceful, I‚Äôm sad but it‚Äôs not painful if that makes any sense.
Has anyone had a similar experience?

1o6vzl7,How to get over my ex if he still lives with me ?,"My ex fiance broke things off with me about 2 weeks ago im (26F) he's (25M) but he still lives with me . He asked me to give him no more then a month to find his own place which i stupidly agreed to . I told him he will need to sleep on the couch which he wasn't a fan of but agreed. This is really hard for me since i am battling a few health problems and i feel alone, i feel like everyone leaves me in my time of need but im always there pouring out my good energy to everyone. Oh well not here to cry or vent about that but i do want to know how can i get over someone i thought i would spend the rest of my life with , if i have to see him everyday . I don't work anymore due to my health and i don't have a car. We have a car that we share but he purchased it so i don't really like to drive it. We moved an hour away from my friends and family but he's 20 mins or less from his so i do feel very isolated. Any ideas? Im very emotional and i tend to say to much so now im barely speaking but still in my room i cry just due to everything crashing down at once ",Born-Psychology-3436,1760486393.0,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o6vzl7/how_to_get_over_my_ex_if_he_still_lives_with_me/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o6vzl7/how_to_get_over_my_ex_if_he_still_lives_with_me/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o6vv1l,Im always left in the cold,"(F21)(M21) we been together for a year and a bit, we have been broken up w for a good few months/half a year but im still hung up on overthinking everything that happened and what really went wrong. I broke up with him bc i noticed lack of effort, lack of interest and little things over the few months that made me question his love for me. I told him id give him a few months to get things together nd then id consider us being together again ofc id work on some of my things too. 

Lets just say a few months passed and there was no difference, he said he wanted me but he doesnt want to ‚Äúhurt me again‚Äù for me to break up with him. A few more months later w back and forth contact and physical contact and it seemed like to me that he didnt really actually want ti be back with me anymore. I offered and he was still unsure which confused me because i thoughts thats what we wanted. I thought the end goal was us and i was willing for us to work on ourselves and come back to each other. But the effort wasnt reciprocated. 

At the end of the day i always end up someones practice partner or relationship before they really want what they want. It upsets me because im honest and clear about my intentions of marriage in the future and thats why i decided to have a relationship with him because i saw myself marrying that man and he said the same. But one year in and things suddenly start changing and i start questioning everything like if you werent sure why didnt you tell me so i wouldnt waste my time. Its just disheartening.",Jolly_Hunt_4965,1760486052.0,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o6vv1l/im_always_left_in_the_cold/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o6vv1l/im_always_left_in_the_cold/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o6vuuv,He doesn‚Äôt leave my mind,"It‚Äôs been 5 days. And I‚Äôm struggling to adjust, I keep replying the two hour conversation in my head, trying to make sense of it all but I can‚Äôt. The past few months have been a lie, each time you‚Äôve said you loved me it was a lie, each time you hugged me, kissed me, it was a lie. Why didn‚Äôt you say you were unhappy? Instead you waited and just let it all out on me so suddenly. I would‚Äôve listened to you, I would‚Äôve understood you and worked to make things better. I just want to know how I weren‚Äôt meeting the standards and expectations, when I tried so hard. I always put you first with absolutely everything. Trying to show you that I do truly care and only want the best for you. And instead you broke me and now I have to fix myself again, and I‚Äôm fighting the urges to call you and beg that we try rebuild that foundation again, but the other side of me is saying it‚Äôs useless, he‚Äôs already made his decision and left. I had so many visions of our future together. You said you‚Äôd stay, you said you‚Äôd stay through whatever obstacles but you were lying because you left so easily. The unconditional‚Äô love you had was in fact conditional. 

I just want him out of my mind now, I‚Äôm doing everything to replace whatever reminds me of him without something better but it‚Äôs so difficult. And I know it has been such a short period of time, but usually I‚Äôd be okay by now. But I‚Äôm breaking down every chance I get, as soon as I‚Äôm left alone, as soon as my environment goes quiet. The distractions aren‚Äôt helping anymore but neither is facing it head on. 

I can‚Äôt even look out of my window without being reminded of him, with him living so close. We go to the same gym, walk the same roads, go to the same stores. It‚Äôs like he‚Äôs everywhere and I can‚Äôt move.",pink-sugacane,1760486038.0,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o6vuuv/he_doesnt_leave_my_mind/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o6vuuv/he_doesnt_leave_my_mind/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o6vtmb,"From first love to my worst heartbreak: How I lost the man I thought was perfect, turns out‚Ä¶.","PLEASE HELP ME.Sooo my ex broke up with me about a month ago. We were together since 13 and I‚Äôm 19 now. We were each other‚Äôs first relationship, first kiss‚Ä¶first EVERYTHING. He was the sweetest boy I ever met. He ticked all the boxes of being perfect. He was calm, caring, quiet, respectful everything a girl could ask for. Initially we couldn‚Äôt be together because of my strict parents but he persisted and eventually stole their hearts too. I have always been an overachiever so I excelled at school, however he didn‚Äôt. He was below average and had no direction of what he wanted to do with his life. I tried my best to help him raise his grades for 3 years. His stepdad would tell him he‚Äôs stupid and his family would always bring him down. But I always tried to reverse that and let him know if his worth and capabilities. Eventually for his exams he succeeded after 3 years. I was so proud of him. His family was abusive to him and no one in his family had a stable relationship. All divorced or in abusive relationships. It was so stressful for me having to handle his emotions about his situations that my grades started to drop. I lost myself. But I didn‚Äôt care. My main focus was trying to be there for him and uplifting him. I wanted him so badly to know his capabilities and that he could do anything he set his mind to. I would lie to his mom about him hanging out with me just so he could see his dad. I even started therepy so I could better myself to be able to be there for him. In our first two years tgt I found out he cheated. I forgave him because I said he‚Äôs just a boy and he‚Äôs immature and he did try his very best to mend it. I was always there for him. His family didn‚Äôt celebrate birthdays so every year I planned one for him. At 15 I saved up 3k just to buy a watch he really loved. We would write letters to eachother and always call. We were really attached and in love. His family would always tell him I would break up with him and he wasn‚Äôt enough for me. Sometimes I knew he felt sad being with my family because he couldn‚Äôt have tht as his own. I would get opportunities that he wouldn‚Äôt and I know sometimes he felt like he wants enough for me or couldn‚Äôt be on my level in his words. But I never viewed it as that. 




He treated me like a princess and he was my prince. From since the day I met him he told me he would make me his wife. He even made a vision board on Pinterest for the life he wanted with me. Sometimes he would cry to me about how he wants to better himself and be a good husband for me one day. He planned out names for our future children even.I took him to church and taught him how to pray the rosary and read his Bible. I would pray with him every night too. During hard situations I would say novenas for him for nine days and pray.Every weekend I would cook food for him and his family be aUs his mom couldn‚Äôt cook. Sometimes when I went over to his house I would clean his room or iron his shirts because he didn‚Äôt know how to. Mind u I was only 16 during this .My mom even gave him free lessons and would pay for therapy for him because she knew he had a hard time. Sometimes he would beg to come over so he could be around my family. My mom is a teacher and he really wanted to go her skl. His parents didn‚Äôt rlly like me at certain points. Anyways he has a best friend who got his heart broken and after that he went full rouge. He would date anyone and anything, he vaped smoked everybting. He wasn‚Äôt a true friend to my ex, he would make my ex do projects by himself that he knew was too much for him. Every-time he invited him to something he would never turn up. About 4 months ago, my ex went out with him which he usually doesn‚Äôt and met up with some girls that were friends with his best friend. Apparently he took one of the girls Instagram and they began talking. On prom night I found out about it and he denied all of it, saying she was just a friend.



I was hurt that he would hide and delete stuff from me but I chose to forgive him again. But the hurt never went away, something didn‚Äôt feel right at all. We started arguing everyday. I admit that I would curse at him or even make problems over little things because I had so much anger and I knew it hurt his feelings.I would constantly ask him if he‚Äôs being truthful or bring up the past cheating. We would argue everyday. I just felt hurt and I felt him pulling away even before the arguing and it made me spiral. Eventually, I started doing things to make him jealous just so he cld show me attention or show he cared. I would cry and beg him to call me but he would say he‚Äôs playing with friends. He didn‚Äôt come to see me for 2 months which never happened before. We barely spoke and he pulled away from me the more I demanded answers. 



Eventually I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore and decided to end things, he cried and I cried. But the next day I changed my mind because I loved him too much and couldn‚Äôt imagine life without him. But he didn‚Äôt want to get back together.But he also didn‚Äôt want us to stop talking. He came to see me after 3 months but it was emotional and I was angry that it took him that long to wnat to see me. After tht day he broke up with me. He became cold, short answers not wanting to talk to me. A week later our mutual friend told me he moved on from me and the girl he met when he went to the mall is who he is with now. I feel heartbroken. He told me I was a good gf. He told his friends how nothing he could do was enough for me. How I had a problem with everything. But it wasn‚Äôt tht. I just wanted him to be his best and better himself and treat me like he used to. He also told them how I was a crush out and a fake Christian because I curse a lot.

After the breakup he completely changed. He spoke badly about my family to others too. Making fun of my dog and saying one of the reasons we could work was because I didn‚Äôt like his dogüíÄ. He bad talked my mom especially which hurt me because she always called him her son and treated him as her own.How could after all we went through together, how close we were, being each others first everything he could just be okay and move on. His mom called me asking me what‚Äôs going on between us and I told her everything and she was upset with him. Saying he was wrong and that he doesn‚Äôt want to accept his emotions and eventually he will feel the effects of the break up. 


I want to move on but I don‚Äôt know what to do. I still love him despite all this and I feel dumb for it. Do u  think he would come back one day? I really want him to one day( not anytime soon) because I think we both need to work on ourselves.

1o6vohe,"Ok, Imma be that person.. How to actually process the pain?","This last relationship has wrecked me. She broke up with me way too many times and I kept giving her chances. I've never met someone who is so incredibly protective of her ego that she can't take any criticism whatsover. 

People tell me that I need to keep busy. I workout a lot, go for runs . Her being an avoidant, she literally told me to expect less, while being that person that if I dont reply to any of her single  text she will literally delete everything and crash and burn. For the first time in my life I don't have the energy to chase another relationship and sitting on my ass feels hard right now. All my life Ive thought and I've been told that if I keep wallowing I won't be able to move on so I start dating new people fast.

First time in my life I want to work on myself. Not be so anxiously attached to someone. I feel myself as a pragmatic person but never in my life have I been so aware of my own flaws. How does one work on themself? Sorry if this feels childish.

1o6vkn1,Sharing My Story,"For me it was love at first sight in Highschool. We dated until I thought the grass was greener on the other side and we broke up. To be fair who knows anything about relationships in Highschool? We went on with our lives. He was in a relationship since college with a student from Germany. When he first reached out again in 2022, he told me they weren‚Äôt together anymore, that she used him for money, a place to stay, and didn‚Äôt do anything in the house. I believed him. I let him into my world, my walks, my family, my home. I then found the profile of his ‚Äúex-girlfriend‚Äù, they were still very much together. She would leave back home and then return to LA throughout the year. Hence when she was out, he was with me. I confronted him about her and he said she won‚Äôt delete those posts but he‚Äôs not with her anymore. She just stays at his place when she comes for school. I believed him. We started on casual dates, I had been sober for eight months when he tells me, ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt know how to have fun do you?‚Äù I ignored it. Once while driving I took the wrong turn and he got extremely mad and threatened to get out of the car, I ignored it. He told me once he is a tyrant and narcissist, but I was naive and didn‚Äôt know the meaning of it, ignored it. The first time we made love, the song ‚ÄúFooled Around and Fell In Love‚Äù came on afterwards and I told him, I don‚Äôt want that to happen to me. The first cooked meal I made him at my house, he told me ‚Äúso is this what our lives will be like? I‚Äôll have to wait for you to come home and cook?‚Äù I was caught off guard. I ran a nationwide swim school, I enjoyed my work, he told me he had a business but later on I‚Äôve realized it‚Äôs mostly his uncles business. One night with the girls I vented to them and they told me to message his ‚Äúex-girlfriend‚Äù, I did. She confirmed they were still together and I was one of four to message her. I broke down at the bar, that all the men bought my girls and I drinks and food, my best friend and I then stayed up to watch the sunrise as I couldn‚Äôt stop crying. I journaled nightly, I cried nightly, I was heartbroken, I‚Äôve never loved anyone as much as I have loved him. I started drinking again, but still continued my gym routine. One random Saturday he called me, asked if he could see me, I caved. He came and was impressed with my new place, told me he was no longer with her that she left forever and we made love. We always had problems though because I never fully trusted him. She came back three times and each time I was thrown to the curb and told we were never in a relationship. Although we acted as if we were. I washed his laundry, took him cooked meals from me and my mum, planned dates, went on trips together, texted all day, talked everyday and most of my time I slept at his house. After the third time she came back last year in June for his birthday, he took her to his aunts house to celebrate and just weeks after she left again he contacted me. He told his neighbor he regretted doing that because of how it affected him and I. We both decided to move on together, but again we always had problems because he never apologized, he thinks he did nothing wrong to me. We started going to family events more together, but we‚Äôre constantly cutting each other then returning to each other. He eventually did change this year. He drew me two portraits for my birthday, he took me on dates, but he wasn‚Äôt always affectionate, I asked him for reassurance and he blamed me for being insecure. We both drank daily and that didn‚Äôt help, when we‚Äôd fight he would ask me to leave and I wanted to fix things so when I wouldn‚Äôt leave he used the water hose on me, he even slapped me three times in one night. I really tried, I continued to cook for him, do his laundry, help him when he needed a ride, or government paper work assistance, I bought fun lingerie for us, I mailed him letters and post cards, I printed our pictures and wrote notes for his album of us I gave him, I burned our songs in a CD, I gave him affection and he would always say that was gay. Deep down I always wondered if he really loved me because of the past, because of what he‚Äôs done and said. He once said we‚Äôd never be together but yet we‚Äôve talked about marriage. I was constantly confused and asked for reassurance that pushed him away from me. That took away his peace. He said I wasn‚Äôt a woman, that I bring nothing to the table, that I throw tantrums and for that he‚Äôs out, he‚Äôs done. He blocked me. It broke me once again. To the point of desperation of wanting to talk to him I would Zelle him $1-$10 to send notes. 

My family and friends advise me to let go for the sake of my health. It‚Äôs hard. I can‚Äôt stop thinking about him, I love him dearly and after everything I believe we can work on this. But he‚Äôs done. I‚Äôve decided to go sober, started going to the gym, but I can‚Äôt help but stop thinking about him. Wondering if he‚Äôs going back to her, I re-read my journal prompts and realized I‚Äôm always crying and asked God to help me stop loving him. He‚Äôs my first love and I‚Äôm having a hard time. At the beginning of the year I lost my job of nine years and after a week, I found a new job that I‚Äôm actually happy in, I keep telling myself the same will happen with my feelings for him, I keep telling myself that it‚Äôs time to move on and take the lessons, I keep reminding myself of all the bad to let go, keep telling myself there‚Äôs no future together for us. I even wrote a list of all the reasons to not contact him, I have 60 reasons so far.
But what other methods can I do to stop loving him, to detach? ",Plane_Estimate2593,1760485262.0,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o6vkn1/sharing_my_story/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o6vkn1/sharing_my_story/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o6vk3h,Broken up with and don't know what to do.,"2 weeks ago I was broken up with by my ex girlfriend. We've been in a LDR now for about 2 months and had been dating over 2.5 years before long distance.

I just feel so lost and confused at everything going on. She told me that she felt emotionally disconnected and that she was feeling constant withdrawals when being apart and didn't know/couldnt stand the feeling.

I recently went back home for fall break and we saw each other and talked because I wanted closure but it felt so nice for us both. On the last day before I had to leave again we ended up hugging for 1.5 hours and crying with eachother. I put away most things in my room like pictures and stuff but still keep the stuffed animals we had.

We have stayed in contact as friends together, something that she mentioned and something that I did want as well. Talking is nice and it feels like shes trying to stay distant because if we've called its much different than text.

She's admitted that she still feels some attraction to me but doesn't want to create a cycle where things are fine when we're back and break up when we're apart. She says she's happy with her decision but cries at it. Part of me thinks maybe it's because she has feelings for another but she's pinky promised that she doesn't (I know that sounds stupid but it's something we take seriously) and that it's just the things she's told me.

Honestly I don't want to lose her forever because everything felt so great with her. She helped/helps me with my social anxiety and was always open to growing with me and I don't know what to do. I don't want to lose her forever but I don't want to be caught in the past. I don't really know anyone here or have many friends and I really struggle to talk to people...

I can answer any questions or anything that people might have.

1o6vjcj,My girlfriend has BPD,"My (28m) girlfriend (27f) has BPD. She is constantly projecting her mommy and daddy issues in every relationship/friendship she has/had. I always tried to be supportive and understanding but it has become such a mental mush fuck every time she calls me. I stare at the phone and fill with anxiety just at the thought ‚Äúwonder what she‚Äôs upset about now‚Äù and every conversation would go back to her mommy and daddy issues or just typical therapy talk. I see how hard shes trying to take control of her emotions but it has completely drained me of my peace of mind. I cannot be my significant others therapist whenever she needs, I want a girlfriend to enjoy life and build something meaningful inside and outside of the relationship. But I cannot be the one to regulate that girls emotions. She asks me almost daily if I‚Äôm cheating on her which I try to be patient and reassure her but her worries only grow worse. (I have never given her a reason to think I‚Äôm cheating on her, and she‚Äôs actually lied to me about hanging out with some guy when we first started dating, which I forgave her for but I can‚Äôt help but feel extremely bitter when she asks me if I‚Äôm the one cheating, especially bc she acts so promiscuous and I‚Äôve had to tell her the way she acts so sexual in public makes me uncomfortable) it‚Äôs the type of girl that just fucks everything with her eyes, and then goes idk why everyone thinks I‚Äôm flirting with them.. which she has worked on but what da hell??. She thinks as long as the sex is good, the relationship is good. she said she bet my friends would all fuck her if they could.. what a fucking joke. I am clown man ü§° She breaks up with me over easily resolvable issues all the time just to turn a full 180 and beg me not to leave her, leaving me feeling very confused and ashamed. She also always makes an ass of herself every time I take her out with my friends, by either getting too drunk, or getting mad at me for not ‚Äútouching her in public enough, because if I actually wanted her I would make it known to everyone‚Äù This past weekend I was a groomsman in my friends wedding, who has been living in Australia the past two years and just came back to America for the wedding. I took my girlfriend as my plus one. Everything was going well until at the reception I went to smoke a cigarette with one of the other groomsman later in the night. My girlfriend was on the dance floor when I walked away and I was gone maybe 10-15 minutes. When I come back she greets me very coldly and starts making rude comments being snippy with me. It immediately upset me so I didn‚Äôt even respond to her comments and just walked away. I go grab a beer at the bar shortly after and she walks up to me and breaks up with me immediately. And then starts acting like the happiest girl in the world and goes back jumping around on the dance floor. And she then starts telling other girls at the reception that I‚Äôm single now and they can have me. It was humiliating and I took her home as soon as I caught wind of that shit.

1o6vifx,"I‚Äôm stuck living with my ex ‚Äî we have a toddler, and I don‚Äôt know how to move on","I (34M) have been with my partner for 8 years. We have a 2-year-old son together. Somewhere along the way, everything fell apart.

I worked hard and sacrificed a lot for our family ‚Äî financially, emotionally, and physically. I supported her dreams, even helped with her social media career, and tried to be the best dad I could. I left work early when she couldn‚Äôt handle things, and I focused all my love on our son. But despite everything, she drifted away.

Now, we‚Äôre living under the same roof, but she‚Äôs emotionally checked out. She‚Äôs moved on, and I‚Äôm still here ‚Äî stuck between wanting her gone and needing her here so our son can have both parents. I tried deleting pictures and memories, but I still wake up thinking about how it all changed.

To make things worse, my health has been declining. I‚Äôve lost over 30 pounds, I have night sweats, and I‚Äôm waiting to see a gastroenterologist who‚Äôs worried it could be something serious. Through all this, she‚Äôs been distant. I feel invisible in my own home.

I‚Äôm angry now ‚Äî angry that I gave up so much, angry that I was left behind, and angry that love can just‚Ä¶ vanish. She doesn‚Äôt work, has no income, and I‚Äôm carrying everything ‚Äî bills, insurance, the house, and my own crumbling health.

I want to move on, but I can‚Äôt. I love my son more than anything, but I‚Äôm terrified of losing time with him if we separate. I‚Äôm even looking into full custody because I just want him to have stability.

I feel completely alone ‚Äî no friends, no family, just me trying to hold it together.

1o6vhlw,Feeling sad,"
I gave this person another chance to make it right after being taken for granted before. We finally moved in together, talked investing,future home, shared so many wonderful moments and interests. We were basically on our way. I always showed up to what mattered to him, no matter how tired I was. I know we loved each other deeply. Our life was so intertwined.

But why was I and my needs always second place to:
- friends
- partying
- video games
- new female friends he cared more to give attention to
- new hobby he gets infatuated with

Why did he keep bread-crumbing me? Why did he keep giving me false hope of getting better? Why did he keep giving me false promises of being a good boyfriend? Why did he use me for comforts and conveniences? Why post-breakup would he re-add exes he called toxic back on his social media? 

I‚Äôm so mad at him and sad about everything. Part of me misses our day-to-day. But I know this is good bye and he will never hear from me again. I know he‚Äôll regret it one day since he already did once before. I was his only long term relationship. Sadly, I will no longer be there for him this time. 

Thank you for the lesson learned, but I know someone out there will appreciate me and reciprocate the love that I give.

1o6vb5l,How do I put myself back out into the dating pool after my breakup?,"So over a year and a half ago, I (20M) caught my ex-gf at the time (19F) cheating on me and trying to cover it up as best she could with excuses. After I told her I was breaking it off as I don't want that kind of person in my life anymore, she said ""Good luck finding someone that doesn't have fun with other people."" Honestly, I have been too nervous to even step back into the dating pool since as I just feel like the next person will do the same thing again. I can actually say I have taken really good care of myself since then and I was kind of wreck during the relationship as I felt controlled. I have hit the gym more often, I continue to eat well, and I have a good job that I love so I am not in college. Not being in college gives me a downside to trying to find someone though because most are in college so there is no real opportunity. Since the breakup I've been asked by a few girls for hookups, and it honestly just disgusts me that this is the world we live in where this is considered ""normal."" At the same time, I am American so this might not apply to other places around the world, but I have just been around infidelity all my life and it's really sad.

1o6vb44,My beautiful girlfriend keeps crying about being ugly after she heard me joking about other women,"
My (21M) girlfriend (21F) of one year is gorgeous, and lowkey the whole package + checks all of my boxes. We are super happy together and I‚Äôve been a good boyfriend. Each one of my friends has told me they want to get with her or had crushes on her (before we started dating).

One of my boys slipped up three weeks ago and told her about a joke I made. She then pressed him more and he ended up telling her about a girl I‚Äôve been making jokes about getting with since the semester started. She was devastated because it fit the bill of the type of girl she knows I‚Äôm attracted to - similar to her, hot and rich. I said some pretty graphic stuff and honestly she probably deserves better than me but I love her too much even though staying together is an uphill battle.

When she pressed me, I told her it was a joke because the girl was too out of my league to be feasible which made my girlfriend freak out. But my girlfriend is also objectively out of my league and I‚Äôve told her that.

I pretty much made jokes about getting them to my bedroom, called other girls my long term play/wife, did some pretty heinous things to be in their proximity (one example was joining a club one of the girls was in) but didn‚Äôt actually do anything with them. My friend also told her when I met her parents I said what the fuck happened to her, bc her parents are majestic.

She keeps crying and saying she hates herself now. I want to be with her still, don‚Äôt know what to do but it‚Äôs salvageable because she still loved me.

TL;DR girlfriend heard me joking about getting with other girls and keeps crying. how can i make her feel better about herself and that she‚Äôs really not ugly?",Pristine_Waltz_6607,1760484566.0,0,0.5,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o6vb44/my_beautiful_girlfriend_keeps_crying_about_being/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o6vb44/my_beautiful_girlfriend_keeps_crying_about_being/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False

1o6va7i,"My (22F) ex-girlfriend (22F) suddenly broke up with me after cheating, and I can‚Äôt understand why","Hi everyone,I really need some advice and perspective because I‚Äôm struggling to make sense of this breakup.
My ex-girlfriend (22F) and I (22F) were together for almost 4 years in a long-distance relationship. We saw each other pretty often, and things were genuinely amazing ‚Äî we were planning to move in together next year, talking about marriage, pets, everything. I spent the whole summer (two months) with her while we were both off from uni, and it was perfect.

We were also best friends before we started dating. She was the person I could be completely myself with ‚Äî my favorite person, my safe place, and the one who knew me better than anyone. So this breakup feels like I‚Äôve lost not just my girlfriend, but also my best friend and the only person I could truly be 100% myself around.

About two months ago, she started hanging out with a guy from her uni a lot. I trusted her completely, but I did mention that I felt a little jealous. She reassured me that they were just friends and that he knew all about me.
Then, two weeks ago, she called me and confessed that she went clubbing with him, got really drunk, and they kissed. She said afterward she immediately felt regret however they went back to his place, but he slept on the sofa while she slept in his bed. I was completely heartbroken and cried my eyes out, but after about a week, I decided to forgive her. I read up on rebuilding trust and made a real effort to repair things.
Meanwhile, she was really busy with a big group project (the same one that this guy was part of), so she wasn‚Äôt very emotionally available. I tried to be understanding and told her we could talk about it more deeply once her project was over.
A few days later, I called her because I was feeling lonely and still hurt ‚Äî especially because she never gave me a clear explanation of why she kissed him. During that call, she suddenly said maybe we should break up. I told her I didn‚Äôt want that, that we could work on it, and she took it back, saying she‚Äôd only said it out of panic.
Then, literally the day after her project deadline ended, she had dinner with a friend and apparently told them everything. The next day, she broke up with me over video call ‚Äî just two weeks after I‚Äôd forgiven her. She said she needed to break up because we started dating so young and she wants to ‚Äúexperience being single‚Äù and ‚Äúbe able to kiss her friends at a club or something.‚Äù
It‚Äôs been four days since the breakup, and she‚Äôs already slept over twice at the house of the guy she cheated on me with. I know this because her location is still shared with me (I know I should turn it off, but it‚Äôs hard).
I‚Äôm just in total shock. A month ago, we were planning our future together ‚Äî and now she‚Äôs sleeping over at another guy‚Äôs place. I don‚Äôt understand what changed or how she could move on so fast.
If anyone has been in my position or hers, I‚Äôd really appreciate any advice or insight. Why would she do this? How do I even start to move forward?

TL;DR:My girlfriend of almost 4 years cheated on me with a guy from her uni, I forgave her and tried to fix things, but two weeks later she broke up with me saying she wanted to be single and ‚Äúkiss friends at clubs.‚Äù Now, just days after the breakup, she‚Äôs sleeping over at the guy‚Äôs house. I‚Äôm heartbroken and can‚Äôt understand how she moved on so fast or why she did this.

1o6uy82,My Mind Is My Worst Enemy,"The house is quiet, but my mind isn‚Äôt. It drags me back to that day; the weight of the air as you said goodbye, and the way I pretended it didn‚Äôt taste like forever. I remember how close I came to begging you to stay, how the plea burned in my throat but never escaped, because some part of me already knew I had lost you.

People love to dress heartbreak in soft words: ‚Äòright person, wrong time‚Äô. Like it‚Äôs something romantic, like fate just misplaced us and will eventually send us colliding again. But if you were truly mine, wouldn‚Äôt the world have made room for us? Wouldn‚Äôt we have found a way to keep choosing each other, even when everything else was falling apart?

Still‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs a stubborn part of me that imagines a different ending. One where time isn‚Äôt a thief. One where we meet again when our hearts no longer flinch at the thought of waiting for the distance to close. A season where love doesn‚Äôt arrive too late.

I‚Äôve told myself over and over that this was necessary, that letting go was survival, that the ache would shape me into someone stronger. But on nights like this, I let myself wander into a fantasized version of the truth: the one where this isn‚Äôt a full stop, just a pause.

And if that world does exist, I hope it finds us wiser, softer, unafraid of the things that once tore us apart. I hope we meet with eyes wide open, hearts unshakable, hands that refuse to let go, and a love that remembers itself across every lifetime.

1o6ugy0,"I told my ex not to contact me, now, 10 months later, I deeply regret it.","Hey everyone,

I‚Äôve been reading stories here for months, but I think it‚Äôs finally time to share my own.
I‚Äôm a 31-year-old guy, and my three-and-a-half-year relationship ended abruptly in December 2024.

It wasn‚Äôt a slow fade. There were no fights leading up to it.
It was just‚Ä¶ gone, out of nowhere

How it started falling apart

In September 2024, my ex left for a solo trip through Portugal in her camper van. It was something she‚Äôd dreamed about for years ‚Äî a year-long journey to ‚Äúfind herself.‚Äù

I supported her, even though it scared me. We were deeply in love. She cried when we said goodbye. We promised to visit each other and stay close.

In November, I visited her in Portugal. We were still completely connected ‚Äî laughin, making plans. She told me she missed me every day, that she felt more seen and safe with me than ever before, that she wanted to keep growing together.

Even the day before she ended things, she sent me a photo of me, saying she missed me and that she was excited to plan my next visit.

And then, the next day, she called me out of the blue and ended it.

Just like that.

She said she needed space, that she felt confused, that she wanted to explore her sexuality and her sense of freedom.
During her trip, she had met a group of women ‚Äî one of whom she connected with in a way that made her question things about herself.

It broke me completely.

‚∏ª

The months that followed

After the breakup, we exchanged letters. She thanked me for our years together but asked me to ‚Äúlet her go.‚Äù
We had one emotional video call a few weeks later, and then she disappeared back into her van life.

She kept traveling for months, surrounded by her new friends ‚Äî that same group she met on the road. They became her circle, her world. She seemed alive in a way that made me feel like I‚Äôd never existed.

She finally returned to the Netherlands in May 2025, but she didn‚Äôt come home. She didn‚Äôt move back to her parents or into a stable life. She parked her van near the beach, started working at a beach bar, and reconnected with those same friends who had also come back from Portugal.

It‚Äôs like she built a new version of her life ‚Äî one that didn‚Äôt include me.
And now, almost five months later, she‚Äôs preparing to go back to Portugal again. Many of her friends from that same group are also heading south, and she‚Äôs joining them.

It feels like she‚Äôs been in motion ever since she left me ‚Äî like she‚Äôs been running, chasing freedom, chasing something she can‚Äôt sit still long enough to face.

‚∏ª

My side of the story

Meanwhile, I fell apart.
I went on antidepressants for a while, started therapy, and slowly began to function again.

I‚Äôve built parts of a new life: more work, seeing friends again, even working part-time behind the bar at a climbing gym.
But deep down, I still don‚Äôt feel healed. I still wake up every morning with that same emptiness. I still think about her every single day.

I check her Instagram sometimes ‚Äî just to feel close somehow. I know I shouldn‚Äôt, but I do. And every time I see her smiling in a post, I feel that punch in my chest again.

She looks happy. Free. Whole.
While I‚Äôm still here, trying to figure out how to breathe without her.

‚∏ª

The regret

A few months after the breakup ‚Äî in March 2025 ‚Äî she reached out to congratulate me on a career milestone. It was a kind, short message.
At that time, I was still in deep pain, barely holding myself together. I told her I needed no contact ‚Äî that I couldn‚Äôt handle hearing from her.

And she respected it.
Completely.

But now, almost a year later, I regret saying that.
Because she never broke that silence.

She never fought for me. Never said, ‚ÄúI know you said not to reach out, but I still care about you.‚Äù
She just‚Ä¶ respected the boundary and moved on with her life.

Part of me wishes she hadn‚Äôt listened ‚Äî that she‚Äôd at least shown that what we had still meant something.

Because it did mean something. To me, it still does.

‚∏ª

What I can‚Äôt seem to accept

I still can‚Äôt understand how someone can go from ‚Äúyou‚Äôre the love of my life‚Äù to total indifference.
How she can rebuild a new world, surrounded by the same people she met when she left, and not once look back.

And I know ‚Äî people will say: ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs moved on.‚Äù
But I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that she‚Äôs still running ‚Äî that this endless movement, this van life, this constant motion ‚Äî is all just a distraction from what she doesn‚Äôt want to face.

That she never really processed what she did.

‚∏ª

My question

Has anyone else ever told their ex not to contact them ‚Äî and later regretted it?

Do you think it‚Äôs just pride holding me back from accepting that silence?
Or could it be that some part of her really could have reached out ‚Äî but chose not to, because that‚Äôs the easier thing to do?

Because no matter how much time passes, I still wake up missing her.
And I still can‚Äôt understand how someone who was once so close, so deeply intertwined with me, can just erase me like I never existed.",xdawning,1760482414.0,8,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o6ugy0/i_told_my_ex_not_to_contact_me_now_10_months/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o6ugy0/i_told_my_ex_not_to_contact_me_now_10_months/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False

It‚Äôs like the only thing people say when you‚Äôre going through this, and it‚Äôs so unhelpful when it‚Äôs wrong","It‚Äôs been a week since we decided to breakup, and we exchanged stuff and made it final yesterday. It was mutually decided, but he was the stronger and firmer one, which I needed honestly. I got dumped in the end, I was a lot less ready. I‚Äôm a pathetic wreck right now, lol, I will be for a while and I‚Äôm buckling up for that. He was absolutely amazing, and genuinely (this isn‚Äôt just breakup delusion), everything I wanted in a partner. It was a right person wrong time thing, and we‚Äôre both really fucking sad.

Took me a minute to tell people - I had a midterm this morning (awesome), and I told my roommate/best friend when I got home. 

It felt really good, and horrible, to talk about it. It made it real, which sucked a lot, but I did feel a weight being lifted as I talked about it. Cried a bunch which felt great. 

I love my best friend, she‚Äôs amazing, and I‚Äôm endlessly thankful to have people who are there for me right now. But jesus dude - I just knew there would be an attitude of ‚Äúhis loss, on to the next, he‚Äôs not all that, you‚Äôll see it one day‚Äù. That‚Äôs always the main sentiment people give in my experience. Which is just so‚Ä¶. dishonest? Especially with this guy, lol. She thought he was great, she really liked him, he was an incredible guy and everyone could tell I was happy in a way I‚Äôd never been before. So it‚Äôs really weird that there‚Äôs such an immediate shift. It‚Äôs like they just have nothing else to say, and I‚Äôd rather they honestly just say nothing lmao. Just let me talk if that‚Äôs all you got, shit is weak, he was wonderful.

I get where it‚Äôs coming from, but I told her like look, no. He was fucking great. He was an amazing boyfriend, and he treated me so well to the end. We really loved each other, and breaking up was the right call, I just didn‚Äôt make it cause I didn‚Äôt want it. He didn‚Äôt do anything wrong by leaving me, it just hurts. 

I‚Äôve gone through a breakup before. My last relationship was 5 years long, and the break up was incredibly tough. And he actually was kind of a shit head, lol, it was much more ‚Äúhis loss‚Äù in that case, so that perspective was a little less annoying. But even then I remember being so frustrated by the fact that no one had ANY OTHER perspective to offer - and they treated any pushback on it like delusion. I couldn‚Äôt talk about the real and genuine loss that was involved without having jump through hoops and justify myself a million times.

With this breakup it‚Äôs so much more frustrating, cause it‚Äôs just literally not true. I‚Äôm not just being overly emotional, you know? I can admit when that‚Äôs the case. But this isn‚Äôt that - he‚Äôs a great guy. Period. 10/10, whoever ends up with him will be happy, I am sure of that. He was a catch, I was really lucky to have met him, and I wish he had stayed with me. It‚Äôs that simple. I‚Äôm not devaluing myself by saying that, I‚Äôm also a great person, both things can be true. I tried to tell her that, that the pain I was in was way deeper than anger or insecurity, it was loss, I need to face that head on while maintaining self-respect. Denying it would be pathetic. I can‚Äôt just pretend he actually sucked all of a sudden, what the fuck is that?

But it seems like it‚Äôs easier for people to basically just say ‚Äúyou think he was great cause you haven‚Äôt gotten over him. one day you‚Äôll see that he‚Äôs nothing special‚Äù. Which is somewhat true, it‚Äôs very fresh and I did experience the fading of those feelings with my last breakup. I know one day *I‚Äôll be ok with the loss*. But that doesn‚Äôt mean I have to pretend there is no loss, that there was nothing rare or unique about him. There was, it would be lazy and dishonest of me to deny that. It genuinely makes me feel worse to encounter nothing but that advice, cause I just know it‚Äôs not true - which makes this feel even lonelier. Idk.

1o6ubk8,Did I make the right decision?,"I recently broke up with my boyfriend of two years and the reason was because he, in simplified terms, was an alcoholic (well, he still is) and I do not drink! However, I was very accepting at first cause i understand that it‚Äôs going to be hard to quit but I had no idea how bad it was. A lot of the weekends this past year looked like him getting drunk all weekend and me doing nothing but sitting there basically. I gave a lot of chances, I was understanding but this last time was different. I go over during the week he‚Äôs drunk and he was being really rude and mean. Calling me names and yelling at me the whole time i was there. I never really saw him being mean when drinking but when he was hung over he would be then as soon as he drank some liquor he‚Äôd be all sweet. 

That is also the only time he was super affectionate was when he drank. I would tell him this and I just started finding myself getting angry whenever he drank. Cause that meant I was gonna have to clean up after him, clean the areas he was in and take him to get food or to get more alcohol. It got annoying after doing it for so long or talking to him while he was drunk was clearly impossible then he would just pass out and get up drink again, pass out, etc. 



The list could go on, and you‚Äôre probably wondering why are you asking if you made the right decision? Well, the thing is his drinking aside which was usually just on the weekends or once or twice during the week and weekends but, when he was not drinking I liked who he was. That‚Äôs the person I loved and cared for deeply. His drinking aside that was my best friend and someone I could always confide in and turn to emotionally.


I guess i‚Äôm just torn cause i care for this person they are my literal best friend but I can‚Äôt deal with the emotional draining of the drinking and first me we both have tried to quit smoking and drinking but he can‚Äôt go more than two weeks without needing alcohol. it‚Äôs exhausting.

I just feel torn is all and need people to be real with me about this

1o6u073,Disconnection or Low Point?,"Hello!

I am 18F he is 18M

Currently I am at a standstill of what to do with my relationship. Highschool sweethearts, 3¬Ω years of dating, and for the last few months I've felt gradually disconnected. When I'm with him there is sometimes a spark back of excitement and enjoyment, but away from him, I rarely feel it.

The last few months have been a lot of disappointment too, though. Over the last year he has stopped taking me on dates, and everytime we would go on one during it I'd have to ask even though I've expressed I just want to be taken on ones. Not anything crazy, simple ones like being taken out to eat. He would make it feel like a chore sometimes and be disengaged. Or ""I'd make it up to you,"" and nothing would ever come about. It was frustrating and I expressed that but he just kinda said he'd do better. We'd have a good 1 or 2 but I felt like over time the bad overweighed it? Dunno.

Also too, he's a angry person. He mellowed out tremendously during our relationship, but it was a lot during it. I am a very calm and optimistic one, but over time I feel like I've just ran out of patience for it all. Then he would do ""tests"" and stuff on me and it just made me care even less, and sometimes would be angry over nothing and push me away but then come back later and be completely okay.  

And he got in a major fight with my family and they don't trust him anymore, which is heartwrenching bc I am very close with my family. 

But he wants to do better, I expressed all my my feelings of feeling disconnected and stuff recently, and he said he could tell too bc when I came over to his house I guess I wasn't as affectionate anymore. He said he would do better and plans to take me out on a date Saturday, but I just question if he's doing it to mellow it out again and then go back to old habits. Or maybe he will continue to do better. I think my patience is so slim I'm maybe jumping the gun on wanting to actually break up.

He's really sweet and he tries, but I cannot quite differentiate if it's spectacular or the bare minimum?? It's my first relationship and I'm scared of making the wrong decision. I don't want to hurt him like that or regret my choices.

Hell, I don't know how to even approach it.

Any advice helps.

TLDR; 
Debating if to break up over too much disappointment or to give it a chance a little more time. First relationship, highschool sweethearts. Bare minimum or worth it?

1o6ty4s,I finally got removed from her family group chat,"My fianc√©e broke up with me about two months ago, saying let‚Äôs separate for a month to work on ourselves and then have a talk to see where we go from here and if we want to continue the relationship. I respected it because I knew it was coming. For months we had become associates who live around each other instead of with each other. I no longer loved her, but I wasn‚Äôt quite ready to call it quits yet. Things were rocky and we weren‚Äôt getting along super well, but I still hoped that we could find some way to revive the spark we lost. I waited for her to call me so we could meet up somewhere and talk, but she never did. 

I finally peeked into her family group chat and saw that her father removed me a few days ago. I was mostly over it, but that sent me hurtling back into heartbreak.

1o6tqgw,I‚Äôm hopeful she‚Äôll come back around any advice? Or anything?,So me and my ex broke up back in beginning of June then in august we started talking again. We broke up because I accused her of cheating someone she works with causing drama and me feeding into her coworkers drama and her coworker reaching out to everyone in my family talking bad about my girlfriend. So a lot of outside drama and me not shutting it down and my sister disrespecting her and me not shutting that down killed our relationship. We started talking again back in august hanging out here and there etc. she told me she lost her job and is not looking for a relationship with anyone at this moment. She said she needs to rebuild herself and her situation before even thinking about one with anyone let alone me.. so we keep hanging out and I keep pushing the being more than friends thing etc. she hugs me she absolutely hates hugs from anyone but will hug me before I leave her place. Well one night she took me to her old neighborhood and went down her old memories growing up with her loved grandmother and it seemed her walls went down. Then later that night before I was leaving she and I finally talked about what happened in the past and everything that went down she said why didn‚Äôt you be the man and stand up for me etc and stand in my corner etc. even though that conversation wasn‚Äôt a good one we finally had it. I‚Äôm thinking we are building something trust something then she goes back into this walls up situation. Well tonight we hung out and just laughed talked etc she asked me my opinions on paint for her walls and she agreed with my choice and what scent to clean her floors with and she agreed and then we filed a report for her stolen dog and she kept saying my partner etc she said I never took you off and won‚Äôt take you off secondary custody for his location chip. But she said I‚Äôm a great guy and all of that and yeah it felt like we were getting somewhere again. She even said it was nice having you here tonight I felt safe secured and your presence was nice.

1o6tpxh,I feel like I‚Äôve been destroyed,"Hello everyone, I am here to talk about a breakup that happened about a month ago, but even now it still affects me so deeply that I still find myself in tears.

If anyone wants to know a little more, feel free to ask, but the truth is I cant keep going like this

To give some context, the story begins in 2023. I had just come out of another relationship, one that I honestly do not miss at all today. I thought I would not fall in love again for a long time. I had known this girl since 2021, although we did not start off on the best terms. I used to make jokes trying to tease her, but it was never with the intention of offending or belittling her. I simply enjoyed the times when we talked, whether by voice or text. For some reason, I liked having conversations with her, even if they were rare.

During that time, she was in a relationship that, according to her, was very harmful and something she never wanted to experience again because the guy was very immature. Later in 2024, she entered another relationship with one of her friends, which turned out to be even worse. For reasons I never asked about, he convinced her to be in a polyamorous relationship, which became a terrible experience for her. She felt awful and eventually distanced herself from him.

During that whole period, I had already pushed aside the feelings I once had for her, thinking it was just something I had to let go of. I focused more on talking with my friends and doing the things I enjoyed.

Then one day in July 2024, something happened that left both of us in shock. A very dear friend of ours passed away, which left her, me, and others completely devastated. I went through an extremely difficult time because I was also struggling with university and some people, including a friend of hers at the time, who criticized me harshly. That made me isolate myself from everyone for a while.

I decided to add her back as a friend because she had also been affected by the loss, and I thought she was someone compassionate with her friends. We started talking again, and when I told her about my problems, she listened. It was such a comforting and unique moment for me, because I really value moments like that.

After that, we began supporting each other. She soon had very bad experiences with that same friend who had hurt me and also distanced herself from her ex who had pushed her into that awful polyamorous relationship. We started talking more often, and every day felt perfect. We talked about many things, about how we could grow, and it genuinely felt like something special.

One day, I decided to be brave and asked her for a kiss, because the feelings I once had for her had come back. She surprisingly accepted, and from then on we started caring for each other more than just friends, even though we had not made it official yet. Later, I told her that I liked her, and she told me she liked me too. That began the usual phase of falling in love, even though we were not yet calling each other boyfriend and girlfriend. That came later.

At some point, she told me she could not continue being with me because the love I gave her reminded her of that ex, and she felt it was something she could not control. She said the problem was within her, not me, and that she could not stop crying. So we ended things there.

About a month later, in November, after we tried to talk as normal friends (even though I had told her many times that I still loved her and could not think of anything else), one night she confessed that she missed me and wanted to be with me again. I was so happy and excited, and we got back together. It felt like a new and beautiful chapter in our story, and I took it as a sign that she truly wanted to be with me.

Time passed, and one day she told me that she had made peace with her ex and their group of friends. I thought that was good news, which was a huge mistake. I felt happy for her, and we entered a new phase where she, being much more chronically online than I am, began spending more time on calls with her friends than with me. That started to create small problems. Even though we overlooked them and forgave each other, I feel like we should have actually solved them, because they later turned into something worse.

I tried to understand that she was busy because she had several friend groups, although she still talked with me and sometimes called me alone. Then came a moment when I had a crisis because of university. I made jokes about wanting to die, but deep down, I just wanted to escape the pain of not knowing how to study or organize myself. She supported me for a while, but at some point she wanted to break up because she said it made her uncomfortable to hear me talk like that. I decided to stop and went to two therapy sessions. Even though it was short, it helped me, and I felt I could keep going.

During that time, she also had several crises. She got anxious when she could not do certain things, and she got distracted very easily. She would work on a video project for five minutes and then spend fifteen minutes scrolling through Twitter. I tried to encourage her to be more focused and organized, telling her that if she managed to improve in that area, she would also make progress in her creative projects. But it was clear that she never really changed.

Another problem was that she really liked alcohol, something that her parents and especially her friends had encouraged. Her friends even told her they wanted her to try drugs, and she seriously considered it a priority. I remember being angry about that, and even though she didn‚Äôt like my reaction, she eventually admitted that wanting to do drugs was wrong. I thought we were heading in a good direction, but later she bought a cigarette just to try it and told me about it. I didn‚Äôt want to be controlling, so I said it was fine, but deep down I was worried.

As time went on, her anxiety and frustration grew worse. She began feeling jealous of one of our friends who learned things faster than she did over the course of two years. I was worried, so I talked to that friend, who told me that he had actually learned many things because she had inspired him and even helped him understand how to use video editing programs better, since she was deeply involved in audiovisual work.

I tried to tell her, maybe too passionately, that she could still improve and progress, but it seemed like her only solution was to go to sleep. Every time I tried to help, she would just say she wanted to sleep to forget everything. I found that lack of empathy frustrating, but I let it go because I didn‚Äôt want to start more drama.

A little later, she had another breakdown and even said she wanted to die because she felt she could not make progress. I tried to help her again, very worried, but it ended the same way. I was starting to feel tired too, but I waited for her to feel better, so I stayed with her.

I also remember a special moment when she was scared she might hurt herself on her birthday and asked me to stay with her that day. I tried to cheer her up and promised I would always be there whenever she felt like that.

Despite the support we gave each other, I began to feel that there was a problem between us. She started spending countless hours on calls with that same group of friends that included her ex and the person from that polyamorous relationship. It did not bother me at first, but sometimes I just wanted to spend time with her, and seeing her spend hours with them made me feel jealous. I never threatened her or blamed her for that, but I did sometimes say passive-aggressive things, like implying she did not want to be with me, even though I tried to control myself. I even considered going back to therapy to talk about it.

Even though this kept happening, I would sometimes join those calls too. Not always, because unlike her, I was already studying at university, while she had failed a school year and was expected to finish this year. I still enjoyed being in those calls, even when they were quiet and mostly about internet drama or the projects she worked on with those people.

One day, during a call, I had an argument with her. I was not in a good mood, and I saw her looking through old messages from one of her friends, which made that friend feel bad. I got upset at her for that, and she messaged me angrily, asking why I was criticizing her. I told her she had made her friend feel bad, and she showed me that her friend had actually asked her to look through those messages. I felt embarrassed and apologized, but she suddenly decided to break up, saying she felt uncomfortable with me and that it was hurting us both. I begged her not to end things, but it didn‚Äôt work.

The next day, I told a friend what happened, and that friend talked to her and convinced her to come back to me because of all the ways I had helped her and because she said she still loved me in some way. We got back together and promised not to make the same mistakes again. That was another big mistake.

A month passed, and we had new problems related to her lack of initiative and her preference for spending time with her friends rather than with me. It got to the point where I felt distant and that she would never ask me first to spend time together, even for something simple. At that point, I developed an unhealthy emotional dependency on her.

One day, she watched a show with her friends that we had planned to watch together months earlier. I could not join that call because I was in another one and got distracted. That night, after she told me she had been watching the show, I asked her to tell me honestly if she no longer wanted to spend time with me or if she preferred to hang out with her friends instead, so I would not feel bad. She said that would be too cruel, and I admitted that my anger had been exaggerated, so we left it at that and went to sleep.

Before sleeping, she suggested that we watch the same show the next day so that I could catch up and watch it with her and her friends later. I agreed.

Then came the day of the breakup. After leaving university, I waited for her, but she simply joined a call with her friends without saying anything, even though that morning we had exchanged loving messages and I had apologized for something small. I waited for her, but later, when I asked what time we would watch the show, she changed the topic completely and told me she would skip her music class because she was tired. I said that was fine but reminded her that it had nothing to do with what we had planned. I asked her to tell me honestly if she preferred spending all day in calls with her friends instead of being with me, and that I would not be offended. She just said ‚Äúok,‚Äù without understanding. I had reached my limit.

After a while, I sent her a message saying she was fake, but I quickly edited it to say that I just had not understood her. It was too late; she had already seen it. When I called her, she sounded tired, something she never told me before. I ended up scolding her for not taking initiative, and she, confused, said she wanted to break up. I tried to stay calm and explained why I felt that way and that she could have just told me if she didn‚Äôt feel like talking that day. She started bringing up other issues, like saying I replied too simply to her messages and that it bothered her, even though she did the same thing and I never did it to upset her. Then she brought up the jokes I made three years ago, when we weren‚Äôt even friends. I told her not to think about that, but she didn‚Äôt want to listen. She said she just wanted to end things. I asked her to think about it carefully, and she said she would sleep on it and decide in the morning.

That night, the thing I feared happened. She broke up with me. She said she felt uncomfortable with me and my behavior, that we were hurting each other, and that she no longer understood me. She added that next time we talked, it would be as friends. I tried to explain what happened, but she only said her feelings were fading and that she had talked about it with her friends, gone outside to think, and decided this was the right choice. I had nothing left to do but let her go. Out of anger and heartbreak, I deleted her everywhere, not because I hated her but because it hurt too much. She did the same.

I told some friends about what happened, and they agreed with me so strongly that they stopped seeing her in a positive light. I regret that now, because it caused problems later.

The next day, she messaged me asking me to leave a public group for her peace of mind. I refused, because it was a public space and I did not want to give her that satisfaction. We argued for a while until she said something that really hurt me: she told me I was never friends with her friends and that I should understand her point instead of starting a fight. That hurt deeply because she was the one who had encouraged me to join that friend group, even when I didn‚Äôt feel like it. I felt destroyed.

Then she said worse things, like that I always wanted to be the center of attention, that I criticized her for everything, and that I was the most egocentric person she had ever dated. I felt so terrible I could barely say anything. I tried to defend myself, but in the end, I accepted part of what she said, though not entirely, because I knew I wasn‚Äôt the person she was describing.

It all ended with her leaving the group, calling me problematic, but saying she wouldn‚Äôt hate me. I cried a lot, feeling awful.

For a few days, I tried not to think about it, but eventually I needed to vent. I posted my thoughts on a private Twitter account I use to express myself. Unfortunately, one of my tweets was seen by someone I trusted, who took screenshots and sent them to her. That person was, unbelievably, her immature ex, the same one she still talks to.

She messaged me angrily, accusing me of doing something I never intended, thinking I would use her photos in some way. I clarified that I would never do anything like that, but she said it was inevitable for her to think that way. I was shocked by how quickly she lost trust in me. Even though I had enjoyed intimacy with her, it was never just physical for me. I always sought to make it romantic, meaningful, and she used to love that. But it seemed she threw away all that trust and chose to see me as someone disgusting.

I did not talk to her after that, but those days were horrible. I suffered thinking about how she now sees me as the worst person in the world, even though she kept me added on social media. I didn‚Äôt take that as a sign of anything; I just thought it was her clumsy way of ending things peacefully.

What hurts the most is thinking about how we went from being so close, planning to see each other, and dreaming about a peaceful, happy future together, to this complete silence. I truly felt that she was the love of my life, the person I was going to grow with, but apparently, none of that mattered to her.

She is still around, appearing occasionally, commenting on posts and things like that. Yesterday, she liked a post on an art account that she knows I own. I checked her profile and saw her sending ‚Äúlove you bro‚Äù messages to one of her artist friends. It made me so angry, because I thought, how can someone like her be surrounded by people who talk so affectionately to each other, but she cannot be truly loving toward someone? How could she reconcile with two exes who treated her worse than I ever did, yet judge me for so much less?

At that moment, I realized the kind of image she had online. She is not famous, but she connects easily with people and always ends up forming bonds with them. I am not saying she never loved me, but the way she acted in the end made me feel disgusted and heartbroken. It hurts to see her being so calm, sending hugs and kisses to all her friends.

I have not talked to her again, but honestly, I miss her so much. I wish she had truly changed and become a better person. I feel she is still immature and will only understand things when she goes through something similar. It makes me sad that I will not be there to support her when that happens.

I cried a few times while writing all of this, and I am sorry.

Now, I just want to learn how to love myself without depending on someone else, because that was the mistake a friend pointed out to me, and I agree. At the same time, I wish I could still hold her and tell her everything will be okay, just like she once asked me to. But it seems she chose to stay with that group of friends, who I believe have influenced her to have strange ideas, like wanting to try drugs at her age (we are both 18) or wanting to move in together with that group to work on their projects.

I miss her so much. I truly cannot stand another day feeling this way, and I have even thought about going back to therapy to ask for advice, because I cannot keep living like this.",SkinnerYTPH,1760480512.0,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o6tpxh/i_feel_like_ive_been_destroyed/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o6tpxh/i_feel_like_ive_been_destroyed/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False

1o6tkph,How to deal with ‚Äúa break‚Äù in a marriage?,"Well, here I am now, after being together for close to 13 years and couple years also married.

Last month I was told by my wife that she needs a break from our relationship, that she needs to understand what she really wants and today was the day that she moved out.

For me this is hitting really hard even though we hardly slept in the same bed in past year (only if we travelled somewhere or we had guests over to use the guest bedroom), but it just is so hard.

we did have our problems here and there, but we always worked it out. I mean was was never mr. perfect, but I did always everything to make sure she is happy and has everything.  
  
problem that I have in this whole situation is that, she is requesting a break, not divorce and that makes it even harder for me.

We haven‚Äôt really lived bad life, I mean, we both have premium cars, we take many trips (visited half of the states here, also went Europe, as well as many weekend getaways to Vegas, Palm Springs, Pismo Beach etc), lot of date-nights out (dinners, concerts, shows etc). We also did lot of hikes together, beach days, pool days and so on.  
Also I don‚Äôt drink much alcohol (I mean I don‚Äôt drink almost at all, maybe 5-6 glasses of wine in a year)

But I am the one who is going to stay in the same address (I wouldn‚Äôt call it home, since it doesn‚Äôt feel like home, when it‚Äôs only me here) with our 2 dogs, that have also been with us for 9 years.

She did move out, rented just a room, at least that‚Äôs what she told me, but I‚Äôm not sure if this is the truth. She is very active on social media messages as well as text messages, but she assures me that she only messages with friends and nobody else. at the same time she doesn‚Äôt want me to look at her phone and that really doesn‚Äôt sound right.

This also put me in a situation that all our home expenses are my responsibility (I mean I‚Äôve paid 95% of all our expenses anyway during this relationship). But she acted very disrespectfully when I told her that her car has to stay here, since I‚Äôve paid 95% of it and asked her to leave it as soon as she was done with moving and figure it out herself, how to get to work the next day (in the end I did let her take the car, until she finds a car she can buy by herself)

About background and what I think has set the course of this relationship to this ‚Äùbreak‚Äù phase.

problem 1 - My work has really slowed down and I‚Äôm currently changing companies and that also means less income (I mean I‚Äôve paid last bills with my savings already) and asked her to really pitch in also, since she works full time.  
I did take 2 months off of everything this summer to recharge and travelled back home together with her at the beginning of the summer, but I stayed 5 weeks extra after she returned home. (I‚Äôve been working nonstop for years, with no vacation days and I thought I really deserved it) She thinks this was irresponsible of me, while I didn‚Äôt have new company lined up yet.

Problem 2 - I used our credit card for purchase, that takes me time to pay it back (still paying it, but she had to make 1 payment also), but I never said that I‚Äôm not paying it back nor refuse to pay it back.

Problem 3 - we haven‚Äôt been able to have kids yet, since she has endometriosis and having pregnancy natural way is almost impossible. We did start with ivf last year but first time didn‚Äôt have luck. We were supposed to have second time this summer when new CA program kicks in, that health insurance covers it (but was pushed to 1/2026), but I guess now this is on hold due to our break. She says also that I‚Äôm not ready to have kids, since I waste too much money (I do help lot of people and organizations financially, since I come from poor family and know what it means when you can‚Äôt get something) and I admitted it also, but also said that if we would have family on the way I would never do that then.

Problem 4 - she says that she is not physically attracted to me (I mean I am no 10, but above average look-wise and I do train a lot and my body fat percent is below 20 with visible muscles.  
I walk 15 000 + steps a day, I still run 10K under 45 min (weekly) and hit the gym 3-4 times a week.  
I also ride my bike 4-5 hours every week, so I‚Äôm definitely not out of shape, but I‚Äôm no bodybuilder either. But to say that after almost 13 years, sounds very much off.

That would really be the big picture here, but I am very devastated and depressed and have really hard time focusing on my new company position.  
I am emotionally very exhausted and do cry over this situation more than I thought I will.  
I honestly don‚Äôt know what to do here.

when I asked her if she wants to divorce, she said no, but said that if I do want to move forward before she has finally made up her mind, then she would understand.

  
What should I do in this situation? how do I stay strong? is this really a break or should I start planning on moving on with my life without her?

any advice is greatly appreciated!

1o6thwb,Unsure of how i stand with them,"It's been 3 day of no-contact since me and my ex(?) had a convo abt stuff that was going on. They were talking abt how they need space bc they're not ready for a relationship and they're not happy with themself as a person.

They told me our relationship came at a time where they needed someone and feels like they lead me on. I asked if they wanted to break it off completely or take a break from this aspect of our relationship. They said definitely to take a break. I do really respect their decision to be honsent but it hurts so much and I feel deep down it will not work out that way. Which I know is crazy to feel like from a 4 month relationship but I miss them so much and this sucks. I don't think they even felt romantic feelings towards me.

I want to talk to them but I know to give space and I keep telling myself to wait at least 3 months before talking to them again.

1o6tdh2,Every man I meet is basically my mom. I‚Äôm attracted to men who are like my mom.,"Hi everyone, it‚Äôs me again. 

So, if you read any of my posts and comments in this sub or others, you‚Äôll see I‚Äôve been through the mill with some of my relationships. 

I am in therapy for a lot of things, but we touched on my relationships in the last 2 sessions. 

I was talking to her about the abuse, the fear of abandonment, the insecurity and the anxious attachment and I suddenly said, ‚Äúwhich is literally the dynamic with my mother‚Äù. 

I even remember now, my ex had smashed a great big mirror onto the ground, when I had shouted at him in the car for threatening to kill us both, because a man had overtook him. He did this a lot. He smashed that mirror and got right in my face screaming at me, spit going all over me. And when he walked away, I wasn‚Äôt even frightened, I looked at this man and thought ‚Äúeww, I know why I don‚Äôt love him anymore, because he‚Äôs literally my mother‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt leave him till 7 months after this incident. I still gave him a chance. 

See my mom would do that to us, trash the house, smash things, scream in faces, grab you and push you around. I never knew if we were getting good or scary mom. I even remember telling her once that she scared me. I was 7. After screaming in my face till she was red, she packed my stuff and sent me to my aunt and uncles for a few nights. Cried her eyes out saying what an evil child I was. I never told her my honest thoughts again. 

 She kicked me out in my 20s, because I had deleted a photo of her and me hugging off her phone. She said I did it because I was embarrassed by her and didn‚Äôt love her. I never touched her phone. 4 days later I got a call from my brother telling me that my mom had actually moved that picture and a load of others to an archived folder by accident. I went home and she didn‚Äôt even apologise properly, just that she‚Äôs sorry she isn‚Äôt perfect and makes mistakes. 

I hated her and loved her at the same time. The amount of times she‚Äôs begged for my help with things and I‚Äôve gone running is insane. And I realise that when things start to go wrong in my relationships, when I get the ‚Äúick‚Äù with the men I‚Äôm dating, that thought, ‚Äúyou remind me too much of my mother‚Äù comes into my head. 

Now my dad was a lovely man, but far too soft and far too under the thumb. But if my brother or I needed anything, even just someone to talk to, we‚Äôd always go to dad. He did so much with us too. He died when I was 18 and it broke me. It broke my mom too. I sort of resented her though, because even 14 years later, she still pines for my dad, still romanticises the relationship. I actually remember her being physically abusive to my dad, throwing him downstairs, calling him names. Like, she didn‚Äôt really appreciate him till he was gone. 

My dad was so in love with her. I remember Elvis, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt help falling in love with you‚Äù came on the car radio and my dad said, ‚Äúoh I love this song, it reminds me of your mom‚Äù. Then he sang it to me- badly- and it brought a tear to my eye. I was so proud that my dad was this hopeless romantic. I was proud that my mom had a love like this. A love I have always wanted. 

Of course, he went and brought her a box of chocolates as a romantic gesture, after hearing this song. It was so cute. And my mom threw them across the kitchen side and said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like those chocolates. Why would you be so uncaring‚Äù. 

I don‚Äôt know all the ins-and outs of my parent‚Äôs relationship, and I‚Äôm certain my dad was not perfect, but he really didn‚Äôt deserve half the stuff he had said and done to him. I actually was kind of relieved he died, because it meant my mom couldn‚Äôt bully him. 

I realise I chase men that remind me of my mother. Remind me of chaos. I find home and familiarity in domestic abuse, because it‚Äôs what I‚Äôm used to. If those men leave me, I pine for them, because my mom often cuts me or my brother off if she‚Äôs not getting her own way, or she feels disrespected. This makes me start to think I need her when she‚Äôs not there- even though in day-to-day I am independent and I don‚Äôt really rely on her. I can‚Äôt rely on her, she‚Äôs only around on her own terms. 

I was talking to my friends about my exes getting so mad they pushed me, or threw me into a wall, or smashed plates at me. I said, ‚Äúwell it hardly ever happens and it‚Äôs only when I‚Äôve really got them angry. Everyone can get like that when they‚Äôre angry can‚Äôt they‚Äù and they all said, ‚Äúno, no that‚Äôs literally not normal‚Äù.

I‚Äôm glad I got my kids out of that household, as they saw me getting threatened and hit a lot. They saw me getting screamed at and name called, and they saw me scream that this is it now, I‚Äôm leaving, so many times. I remember my eldest was 2, with her nappy on and dummy in her mouth, toddling to cuddle my legs and stop her dad from cornering me, and that made him flinch and stop. Our children saw that abuse, for the first few years of their lives and I have no idea if that‚Äôs going to impact them in the future. I now have a 4 year f daughter who questions why can‚Äôt mommy and daddy live together? It‚Äôs not fair. And a 3 year old son who only really remembers that he‚Äôs got 2 homes, and nothing else. 

I want you to know, if you are repeating the same cycles in your relationships and they end in failure, perhaps look closer to home to find clues on how to really heal.

1o6tcij,After 16 years he left.,"I feel like this is the only place where someone can understand me. I just want to share my story and hopefully get some feedback? I know this is Reddit but please try and be kind, I‚Äôm so very broken mentally right now.

I‚Äôll kind of change out any identifying info. But anyway I‚Äôve been with my now ex since I was 14 and he was 17. We are now 30 and 33, so yes 16 years. We never got married cause well he never proposed. And no kids. 

Our relationship definitely had its ups and downs. At times it was a bit toxic. We fell in love instantly and had such a strong bond. Young kids addicted to partying and no sense of direction. Life was tough sometimes and we took it out on each other. I would say we both messed up in a lot of ways‚Ä¶but about half way through our relationship he started crossing lines. Like stuff you should come back from, but because I loved and wanted things to work w/ him we did anyway.

Fast forward to present day we live together in the town we met in. I decided to get my life together finally. I lost a ton of weight, enrolled in school and through all my efforts got accepted into law school. At first I didn‚Äôt get in and he seems equally as hurt for me. But then when I did get in everything fell apart. 3 days later we got into an argument and he just went off on me. Accusing me of never loving him, being there for him, wanting other men etc etc 

Though I respect his side, that just wasn‚Äôt true. I had been there for him sooo much. Even through years of unemployment. He said now it‚Äôs finally his turn to make decisions for himself. I‚Äôm like?? I never prevented you from anything. Anyway he decides we take some sort of break and he said he‚Äôs going to visit his Dad states away for a little bit.

We talk it though and get to a good place and he promises he‚Äôll be back in a certain time frame. He‚Äôll work there and save up etc. Keep in mind he leaves me with all the shared expenses in our home b/c according to him, why should he pay while he‚Äôs away? Also leaves me to care for our dog we got together. 

Over the next couple months he barely sends me money to help. I‚Äôm working less, paying all the bills, and attending my first year of law school. We talk nicely and keep in touch. Until one day I express that this whole thing makes me sad. We end up breaking up on/off. Until this final time he‚Äôs like why would I come back home to someone who does abcd? I promised I‚Äôd come home but basically not until this or that. Like literally holding the relationship over my head. It‚Äôs been a couple weeks since I said please just leave me alone if you‚Äôre not serious.

And he has, and it hurts. I know deep down somehow I deserve better. But sometimes it feels like I can barely breathe without him.

Help. 

Edit: And to add his condition is that I move to his Dad‚Äôs state eand try and do law school there. Or I guess I deal with him gone the next 4 yrs.

1o6t8ym,"He got a new gf 1 week after we broke up, why do men do this?","We only dated for 6 months but it felt like a year because I was seeing him every single day & night and had practically moved in with him. We were both more on the codependent side tho so maybe that‚Äôs why. 

When we broke up, he was bawling his eyes out screaming in pillows saying things like it took him all his life to find someone as compatible as me, he‚Äôs never gona find someone else, I‚Äôm his first love (i was literally his first relationship and sexual partner). Meanwhile I find out he got a new gf one week later. 

One week before I left his city we were broken up but still hooking up. I saw him talk to her at the climbing gym he said he just met her through climbing or they had mutuals. He said he thought she had a crush on him. I asked if he was going to date her jokingly and he said noo he wasn‚Äôt ready for any relationships anytime soon not to worry. Guess he was wrong.

How do men just flip a switch like that? I found out they‚Äôve been dating now for 3 months so half our relationship length and he‚Äôs introduced her to his mom. I used to think she was just a rebound but what if he dates her longer than me, what if he actually marries her? Or if he breaks up, will he only think of her and never even consider me?

He had jealousy issues too and was always worried I would leave him for someone better but I feel like he‚Äôs done exactly that and just jumped on the next thing. 

I feel cheapishly replaced, like he didn‚Äôt even give himself time to mourn and process our break up. Did I mean so little to him? And I feel so lame still being hungover the break up when he‚Äôs already moved on so fast.

1o6t7z7,My beautiful ex keeps crying to me that she‚Äôs ugly after I got caught joking about other women,"My (21M) ex-girlfriend (21F) of one year is gorgeous, and lowkey the whole package + checks all of my boxes. We are super happy together and I love her. Each one of my friends has told me they want to get with her or had crushes on her (before we started dating).

I‚Äôm going through a hard time and made some jokes to my boys out of insecurity/mental health. We are technically broken up now (I broke up with her so I could become a better man after this) but acting like we‚Äôre still together.

One of my boys slipped up three weeks ago and told her about a joke I made. I‚Äôm going through a hard time and didn‚Äôt mean what I said. She then pressed him more and he ended up telling her about a girl I‚Äôve been making jokes about getting with since the semester started. She was devastated because it fit the bill of the type of girl she knows I‚Äôm attracted to - similar to her, hot and rich. I said some pretty graphic stuff and honestly she probably deserves better than me but I love her too much even though staying together is an uphill battle.

When she pressed me, I told her it was a joke because the girl was too out of my league to be feasible which made my girlfriend freak out. But my girlfriend is also objectively out of my league and I‚Äôve told her that.

I pretty much made jokes about getting them to my bedroom, called other girls my long term play/wife, did some pretty heinous things to be in their proximity (one example was joining a club one of the girls was in) but didn‚Äôt actually do anything with them. My friend also told her when I met her parents I said what the fuck happened to her, bc her parents are majestic.

She keeps crying and saying she hates herself now. I want to be with her still, don‚Äôt know what to do but it‚Äôs salvageable because she still loved me.

1o6t7t3,letter to KDP,"I'm finding myself quieter, I don't enjoy spending time on my own anymore. I have to plan my weekends out so I don't talk myself into throwing myself off the bridge into the A46. I have a weird guilt too because I chose this, I broke up with you, although I see it as I had to give you up, I never wanted to leave you I still hate it now. you did things that I couldn't forgive so I know in my head I did the right thing but my heart heals whilst I'm asleep and then falls apart bit by bit again throughout the day, each of the 100 times I think about you. I still have the box of items, the candle, the dried petals even the confetti from the balloons you gave to me for our first valentines day. its been 5 months give or take since we last texted, the last thing you said to me being ""I love you"". so I should have gotten rid of everything by now, deleting pictures eventually was do able but something about physical items feels like a gut punch, I plucked up the courage to smell the candle that smells like you, still not lit, and it ruined my week. that one sniff took me back to our happiest memories. just us at uni in your room,  the entire world locked out from our happiness and naivety that comes with falling in love. I have alt accounts so I can act out how miserable I feel via reposts that nobody is gonna see, in hopes that it feels like a release cause that's what you said helped you sometimes, I've not found it works yet, a few weeks ago it got really bad, I didn't think id consider ending my life because of a guy, but you broke the mould, as much as I know we don't work and you made me unhappy in the relationship, I also know you we're possibly the one and that from the age of 23 onwards I may never find someone who can make me feel a fraction of the love I have for you. so I repeatedly ask myself can I continue living thinking that Im going to be alone forever because my ""the one"" can't work.

1o6t7ki,"Four months after ending my (first and only) relationship, my ex is already with someone else","Hi everyone!  
This post is my attempt to find some comfort and hear from people who have gone through the same thing I‚Äôm going through. The story is a bit long, and English isn‚Äôt my first language, so please ignore any mistakes, and here we go!

I‚Äôm 24 years old, and this year I had my first relationship. I‚Äôve always been a very shy and insecure girl. For a long time, I was afraid of letting people see me and like me ‚Äî but that changed. Last year, I met a guy during a training program where I was working as a secretary, and we started talking. At first, I acted the same way I always had with other guys: I pushed him away, even though I had feelings for him.

We kept talking, and I made it clear to him that I had problems that made me shut myself off from everything. But that wasn‚Äôt a problem for him back then, he kept insisting on being close to me.

Then something huge happened in my life: my mom found out my dad had been cheating on her with several other women, including sex workers, and everything turned into hell. My mental health, which was already fragile, deteriorated completely. Most of my days and energy went into trying to calm the chaos between them and find a bit of peace in what used to be my home.

It was an ugly breakup. I almost had to testify in court for their property division. My mom moved out because my dad refused to let her stay in the house. My hair started falling out from stress; the only moments my eye didn‚Äôt twitch and I didn‚Äôt cry were when I was asleep. I think the only reason I didn‚Äôt have a full breakdown was because I still had classes at university, and I had this boy by my side.

So, we started dating. I thought it would be a good decision, a way to distract my mind and heart with feelings that weren‚Äôt anger at my dad or sadness for my mom. But I had never had a boyfriend before, so I didn‚Äôt understand the weight of being in a relationship ‚Äî and I don‚Äôt mean that as a burden, but as the responsibility of being emotionally and physically present, of supporting someone else. And I realized I couldn‚Äôt do that.

My mind was so drowned in my parents‚Äô drama that I began projecting all my sadness and stress onto my boyfriend. I started isolating myself. He never complained, but I felt so miserable for treating him that way that I decided to end the relationship. He obviously didn‚Äôt understand and told me he loved me, that I didn‚Äôt have to go through everything alone ‚Äî but I was so depressed that it didn‚Äôt make sense to me. My problems are mine to deal with, right?

It‚Äôs been four months since we last spoke, and I haven‚Äôt stopped thinking about him or about us. My birthday was at the beginning of this month and he was one of the few people who remembered, which only brought all my feelings for him back to the surface: affection, guilt, and shame for being such a broken, messy person. For not being good enough for him.

We talked briefly, he sent me a picture from the day we met and told me he‚Äôs dating someone new now, that she‚Äôs a great person and that he‚Äôll do his best for her. That completely destroyed me. Now, on top of everything, I‚Äôm crushed knowing he replaced me in just four months. I mean, he told me he loved me (?) None of this makes sense!!! I feel even more miserable now. I‚Äôve cried and thrown up; I humiliated myself telling him I still have feelings for him, told him that if I could go back in time, I‚Äôd do everything differently and I feel so awful for saying that to someone who‚Äôs in a new relationship. He said he misses me and that we could remain friends, but I told him that would only hurt me, and that it would be a terrible thing to do to his new girlfriend. 

Still, I feel like maybe that‚Äôs what I deserve for being immature and isolating myself. I understand he couldn‚Äôt wait for me forever, but I can‚Äôt wrap my head around how someone can move on so fast. While I‚Äôm here trying to pick up my pieces and let go of the fantasy of a happy family and a life with him, he‚Äôs already with someone else.

Am I being too dramatic? Am I a horrible person? Like I said, it was my first and only relationship, and this whole thing is terrifying. I‚Äôve never felt like this before, and I think the fact that the rest of my life is a mess only makes the sadness stronger. I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll never like anyone the way I liked him (just the thought of dating again makes me want to throw up), that I‚Äôll never be vulnerable again, that I‚Äôll stay stuck in this limbo forever.

Before anyone says anything ‚Äî yes, I‚Äôm going to start therapy. I just wanted to hear some kind words, something that could soothe my heart a little. I need someone to tell me that this will pass, that I will stop loving him, that I'll be ok. This is SO hard! I just want to cry forever!!

1o6t616,"My ex still missed her previous relationship, I'm hurt and confused.","So I've got dumped by my ex recently, we been dating for half a year, she said she's been in relationships since she was 15 and she feels like she lost herself, also because our relationship was full of conflicts and arguments and she felt like this was the healthiest thing to do.

To give context, our relationship had a **very** rocky start, we started to develop feelings for each other while she was still with her previous partner, When she met me, we connected really easily and our friendship deepened, we had some ups and downs, she fell in love with me and I fell in love with her, and things got really intimate between us, she was really confused and in the end, she kissed me and we made out, after that, she left her ex to be with me.

at the start, I was really supportive of her, she told me she needed time to process things, and I've told her that it's fine and I understand it completely, but as time gone by, it seemed like she didn't really moved on, or at least, part of her heart was still stuck on her previous relationship, she was open with me about her feelings, and how she felt towards him, and I've tried to be supportive and listen, but with time, I couldn't bring myself to not become insecure in our relationship, she was talking about him almost everyday, she let me read her journal, which she wrote there that she misses him so much and she thinks about him everyday, It was really rough to hear, but I did truly loved her and wanted our relationship to flourish, we got to fights in a weekly basis, and I've tried my best, I've even started going to therapy to work on myself, so I could be a better man, for me and for her.

I think the most crazy thing in our relationship happened on her birthday, we dated for almost half a year, we've gone to her favorite restaurant, where she goes almost every year on her birthday, when we got there, the hostess said ""oh there's a present for you, someone left it here and said to give it to some curled hair woman"", she gave her a book with a note, it was from her previous ex, it really destroyed me, I was just terrified and shocked, I've felt like our relationship is just being shadowed by her past relationship, two weeks after that we broke up.

After she dumped me, she said that I wasn't able to handle all of her emotions(towards her ex), without being hurt, that she felt she couldn't really express her emotions because she was busy defending my emotions, so she wouldn't hurt me. even though we did had conversations about how she felt, but she said how she felt about her ex wasn't the reason of why she dumped me. Something that truly broke me was the fact that while logging out of her accounts on my computer, I saw one of her notion notes, 3 days before she dumped me, she wrote that deep in her heart, she wishes her and her ex would be a couple again, that she want to talk to him so bad, she misses his scent and their talks. It truly broke me, I'm just so confused and hurt, I truly loved her so much and she was so special to me, and reading those words just felt like a deep stab to my heart, I don't even know if she misses me anymore or she just misses her other ex, because when we talked after the break up, she was  just act really cold and distant.

1o6t0r5,Me and gf broke up over different futures and goals :( M23 and F23,"Me (23M) and my girlfriend (23F) have been together for about a year. We were planning to move out together in the next couple of months, but lately everything‚Äôs been falling apart.

She still lives with her parents, and her mom is super strict who cries and guilt trips her whenever she tries to tell them she wants to move out with me and it makes me mad cus they don‚Äôt really let her come over 

We recently started talking more seriously about the future, and that‚Äôs when things got rough. I told her I‚Äôd like to have kids in maybe 2‚Äì3 years, but she said she‚Äôs not ready until she‚Äôs 27 or 28. Then she said she wants to focus on her career and might even want to move to another state one day for work. I don‚Äôt really plan on moving, and that‚Äôs where the conflict started.

She told me that if I really loved her, I‚Äôd be willing to move with her. But to me, it feels like if she really loved me, she‚Äôd want to build a future together where we both feel comfortable ‚Äî not just follow one person‚Äôs dream.

We ended up breaking up over it, but she keeps telling me she wants to work things out. The thing is, it always feels like she wants to work things out her way. Like I have to adjust, compromise, or wait, but she doesn‚Äôt really bend on anything.

I really do love her and don‚Äôt want to lose her, but I also feel stuck ‚Äî like we‚Äôre both trying to hold onto what matters to us, and neither of us wants the other to give up their dreams. We both care about each other, but it feels like our futures are pulling us in different directions. I don‚Äôt know if that means we‚Äôre just at different stages in life or if love is supposed to be enough to figure it out.

Like I want it my way and she wants it her way and we can‚Äôt meet in the middle about anything

1o6sy10,She broke up with me and it's soul crushing,"It's almost been a week since she broke it off. We were together for 11 months and our anniversary is Halloween. We both just kept straining each other with self loathing. I got pretty bad near the end. I threw away pretty much everything that made me happy. It was scary honestly, I didn't even know I did it. I was so isolated right after it happened I ended up self harming my thigh really bad. I had nobody else to talk to about it and I was so terrified I'd get overwhelmed again. I had only self harmed once as a kid out of curiosity and never did it again. So of course in my frightened state I reached out to her, I just wanted to talk to someone she knew wasn't a bad person. She told me I was being unhealthy and obsessive. She said that I needed to respect her decision to end it. It hurt a lot to hear, but I'm glad she was that brutal with me. I really needed reality to hit me in the face. I want to just focus on myself and become the best version of myself. It's just been a constant teeter totter of feeling inspired to be better and feeling so sick after impulsively looking at her socials and seeing her matching pfps with her friend. On tik tok they matched with marceline and princess bubblegum. That just sets my overthinking brain off so bad. I know I'm going to get better and see the light eventually and get better for myself. I have no desire to start another relationship with anybody. I want to just go on a self improvement journey, but leave that door cracked behind me for her in the future. I know i need to get over her to start improving, but I can't just shut the possibility out. I know it's corny but some part of me just knows there was a special connection between us and I'd be a fool to fully shut the door. I've never genuinely strived for a real future with someone before, I've never had more meaningful conversations before in my life until her. I guess what I'm asking is how do I deal with this anxiety of her rebounding and that day never happening? Like logically I don't think she'd even rebound(she seems wiser than that). I know I just need to focus on myself and I am making strides for myself. I'm trying to be more positive in life. Like no matter if I see her again or not, I'm so incredibly grateful for the eye opening revelation she gave me about the person I truly want to be.
No matter what though I'll always hope for the best with her. She's genuinely the greatest person I've ever met in my life and she deserves to be the happiest version of herself, with or without me.

1o6sn9p,Trauma and Abandonment Bled into Everything,"When I was a child, my whole world changed when my parents got divorced. When I think back, I can't seem to recall even caring, but I think I had just put up walls that made me avoidant. They put me in therapy for months, but I couldn't even talk about my feelings because they were pushed so far down, so they took me out of therapy. Throughout my whole childhood, my parents had their own thing going on, my dad was a drunk missing in action, and they were never home, so I was always alone. I felt so abandoned whenever I've been by myself since then, I think.

When I was 16, I had a girlfriend that I really cared about, but I got in trouble and got expelled. For obvious reasons, she left me, and she entirely cut off contact with me without saying a word. She got with a friend of mine and they were together for years. My friends were nowhere to be found when I got back, because I had gotten in trouble and no one wanted to talk to me. I got into more trouble, and it got to the point that I even ran away to school away from everyone I knew, mostly to avoid wherever I had been.

When I was 18, I had two best friends that I always hung out with, and I had a crush on one. They ended up getting together, and after a year or so, they split up. When they split, my friend who I'd had a crush on in the past threw me out with the bath water and just decided to ghost me. She sent me so many messages about what a horrible person I was and would message me every once in a while to say ""fuck you"". I don't know what I did to this day, because it had nothing to do with me.

When I was 19, I dated a couple of times in the dorms, and each time, the other would leave me for someone else in my building.

When I was 20, I began dating a Chinese exchange student. I thought we would be together forever at the time. We were together for 4 1/2 years, but she ended up leaving me to return to China without explanation. I found out later she had been with someone else half of the time and she got married to him.

I'm 31 now, and I've had issues sharing my feelings or committing myself to relationships. It took me a long time to get over my previous girlfriend, and I didn't treat my ex very well in the beginning of our relationship, because I was still not over the previous girlfriend. I kept dating her, and I spoke with other women several times, even cheating on her twice, but she took me back. She hung in there, despite my cruel acts. I was grateful, and slowly she broke down my long-held aversion to commitment, and I wanted to marry her (still do). However, I still had issues with avoidance, and it made me close myself off to the point that I stonewalled and got defensive when she tried to share her feelings in a perfectly healthy way with me. Whenever I started to feel guilty and upset because of how I was making her feel, I would blow up and leave the room to play VR or drink, literally putting myself in another world. She was the most kind, caring, and considerate human I've ever met, and I was ripping her heart out by ignoring her cries for emotional intimacy. Her cries for what I, too, needed. Slowly, that eroded trust and openness, eventually breaking her love for me. She stayed for about a year and a half more, until she left me a little over a month ago to live with/date my ""friend"", nearly 8 years after being together. 

It had taken me so long to tear down just the barrier to commitment, and I just don't know how to handle having someone walk away that I wanted to spend my life with. I quit drinking recently, got rid of my VR, stopped watching tv, and started going to therapy and learning about attachment types. Shedding those distractions has opened my eyes over the past month to the ongoing emotional abuse I subjected her to, though it was in no way intentional. I wish I had gone to therapy long ago, and I know it would have saved our relationship. I know I could have avoided hurting her so much if I had just been able to be vulnerable and given her a safe space to be vulnerable. I would do anything to have a real conversation with her now about what happened or how I got here, but she has closed her heart off and won't share her feelings with me. I brought my trauma to the relationship, traumatized her, and ruined the best thing that ever happened to me. 

At this point, I don't know if I can be intimate with another woman ever again, and I don't want to. I have so much therapy that I need to get through this, and I feel lost and hopeless, abandoned again. I know she did it for her wellbeing, but I wish someone had literally dragged me to therapy. I wish I hadn't blinded myself with distractions and actually just listened to her. She cared for me so much and would have supported me through my depression and trauma. I would have supported her, had I not had blinders on. I still have the ring, and I'm doing everything I can, but I accept that I can't control the actions of others.

The guilt of hurting her, the loneliness, and my inability to make amends and grow with her might kill me, I'm trying so hard to hang in there, to be physically, mentally, and emotionally healthier, but I have no one to share it with. If only I could explain this to her, if she could feel like there was anything at all to fight for or heal from with me, I would go to therapy with her in an instant, even if we didn't fix our relationship. I am crushed, and the dreams I've had for years feel like nothing. I don't know how to live with myself, and I can't even focus on work or being around people. I'm seeing a psychiatrist tomorrow for medication, but even with that, I will still go home to an empty house that I'd rather burn down than reside in. I'm having an identity crisis, and I don't know who I am anymore. I know I'm not a bad person, I know my love for her was the most real thing I've ever felt, but I fucked up everything so many times, and I do feel like a monster.

1o6skpy,I can‚Äôt move on. He broke me completely.,"Hi. I‚Äôm writing this post because I can‚Äôt cope anymore. It‚Äôs been going on for too long. Maybe someone here will listen to me, maybe say a kind word, maybe understand. It‚Äôs so unbearably hard for me‚Ä¶It all started on the night of July 2nd to 3rd. That‚Äôs when my boyfriend, the one I loved more than life itself left me. On our 8-month anniversary. But did I do the right thing using the past tense? Because I still love him. And that‚Äôs what hurts the most. He was the one who picked up my broken, shattered heart, pieced it back together, gave me for the first time a sense of safety, love, commitment, warmth‚Ä¶ and then crushed it completely, tore everything down. I was left abandoned overnight, over Messenger.

The reason? I suffer from OCD, focused on tokophobia, because of my past traumas. I didn‚Äôt want to have penetrative sex with him, but that doesn‚Äôt mean I didn‚Äôt care about his needs. I often did things I didn‚Äôt feel like doing, just to make him feel good. Still, he decided it was a problem. He said he was tired of my issues, that he didn‚Äôt love me anymore, that ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt be in a long-term (we were together for 8 months) relationship like that.‚Äù

I was working on myself. I was going to therapy, had an appointment with a psychiatrist, and was ready to start medication. He didn‚Äôt talk to me about it, didn‚Äôt tell me he was struggling, didn‚Äôt try to save the relationship. He just left in the most disrespectful way possible.

You know what hurts the most? That a week before the breakup, we were intimate. Exactly a week later, he told me he didn‚Äôt love me anymore. I feel used, dirty, stripped of dignity. It‚Äôs impossible to lose feelings in just seven days.

Since the breakup, I‚Äôve changed. Before July 2nd, I was a smiling girl who, despite a difficult past, was doing great in therapy. I weighed 60 kg at 175 cm tall, had beautiful skin, and long, thick hair. Now I weigh 52 kilos. My hair is falling out in handfuls. I deal with chronic stress by picking at my skin. My cycle is completely messed up. I can‚Äôt eat. I look like a living corpse. My face is pale and bluish. Since that damned day, I haven‚Äôt slept a single night without waking up unless I take sleeping pills. Every night I fall asleep crying, and wake up with terrible pain in my chest on the left side, like my heart really did break.

Even my studies, my greatest passion, no longer bring me joy. I was planning to do a PhD, to grow in several fields. Now, the only purpose of my life is survival. I feel like there‚Äôs no one for me. I‚Äôm alone. My life is over. I love someone so much. someone who used me and abandoned me. Someone who made me trust again for the first time in so long, who made me feel needed, loved, and then treated me without the respect an adult in a serious relationship deserves.

wish I could turn back time.
I wish I could go back to October or November 2024.
I wish I could be that same happy girl with dreams again.

I‚Äôm 20 years old, but I feel like a helpless, abandoned child.
Maybe I‚Äôm overreacting. Maybe I should just pull myself together. but I can‚Äôt.

The closer it gets to what would‚Äôve been our anniversary, the worse my mental state becomes. Nothing makes me happy anymore. I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôve forgotten how to love. My heart wants to beat faster again, but it‚Äôs impossible.

I tried to move on. I even had a short relationship in the meantime, but what does it matter, when the wound in my heart is still open and bleeding, even after three months?

I can‚Äôt do anything. I want to live, to grow, to fulfill myself, but I can‚Äôt. I blame myself. Still, I function. I try.

Will it ever get better?

1o6si6m,"Just broke up with my partner of 4 years today, and I just don't know what to do!","My boyfriend (33) and I (32) just broke up after 4 years and 4 months together. We had been through a lot together. He had cheated around the 2-year mark with his baby mama, asking her for sexual pictures. Now, mind you, we had a VERY good love life, and I was always ready for it. A lot of times, I would want it more than he did. However, I still decided to give him another chance. Well, we have lost 2 kids together as well, a stillbirth and a miscarriage. Currently, this year has just been horrible for us. I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety, and I was let go from my job, and then my grandfather passed this year as well. With all this happening to me, all he does is tell me what I need to be doing instead of actually understanding me. He doesn't know how to communicate, and every time I try to talk to him, he gets mad and takes it defensively. I literally begged him today to just talk to me so we can work on getting on the same page with each other, and he yells and screams at me, throws the game controller at the wall. When all I want to do is try to fix us! I just told him I was done, I cant fight anymore when I'm the only one swinging. I just feel so lost in life, like I have nothing more! I tried and tried, and it still didn't work. 

  
I am all for being accountable, and I have no issues admitting I am wrong, but in our 4 years, he has NEVER admitted he was wrong or apologized when it was clear he was wrong. 

  
I am the type of woman who prides herself on being respectable and holds myself to a higher standard than most, so I've never been a girl in the streets or having a bunch of sexual partners and things like that. In a way, I have been saving myself for the right one, which I thought was him. 

  
I just don't know what I did wrong or how I am going to recover from this.

1o6sa4w,"My ex cut me off, probably for good","3,5yr relationship that I broke off in January after waking up (partly thanks to this sub) to the cycle of toxicity and resentment that had went on for years. He wanted to stay in contact. I didn't know if I did. And so, because one of our problems was me not being able to stand up for myself, we did. Sort of.

I have a habit of not returning calls or responding to texts, even with my friends and family, that really flares up when my mental health takes a dip. Which it does fairly regularly. And even on a good day, the thought that people expect more from me than I'm willing to give freely feels like a noose around my neck. And this year has been stressful, extremely so, even if it's also been one of the best years of my life. So I've admittedly avoided responding to his texts, both due to my mental health and because the breakup left me sore in a way I desperately wanted to run from in any way I could. In the spring, the first time he contacted me after our breakup, I ghosted him for months. This fall, we've talked on the phone a couple of times.

He's been trying. And been upset that I haven't. Tonight he texted me that he can't keep trying to be in someone's life who shows no signs of actually wanting him there. And that for his own sake, he will have to end our communication for good. I, for once, texted him back, telling him I respect his decision and apologized. Again. Then cried a little. It almost feels like we've broken up again. 

And I don't know how to feel about it, hence my screaming into the ether here. There's the familiar resentment ‚Äî still, even after we've broken up, he's been demanding I give from what little energy I have, has never once shown any interest in how I'm doing, and now he has the nerve to cut me off because I'M making HIS mental state worse? And on the other hand, I've been slapped in the face with an uncomfortable truth once again ‚Äî I really am not a very good friend, or sister, or daughter. I'm truly lucky the people in my life put up with my flakiness. Is it only a matter of time when the rest of them stop trying as well?

And finally, I feel a sort of freedom. I'd thought January had been when weight on my chest that had made me feel like I'd been suffocating for pretty much our whole relationship had been lifted off. But now, I feel I'm actually finally out of the limbo. I can breathe. He did what I should've had the self-respect to do almost a year ago. We might circle back again someday. Part of me hopes we will. Another part is scared we might.

1o6s4zw,Im broken for the first time.,"On october 4 I got broken up with and i dont know how to cope with it. 

For context, my ex 24 F and i 23 F were long distance (different countries) for 8 years. I saw her twice a year, usually for weeks/months at a time, but we were CONSTANTLY in contact through either texting or videocalling. The reason she left me isnt because she didnt love me but because closing the distance was going to be a really hard process on everyone. 

Is it weird that i kind of wished she told me she didnt love me anymore ? Would that have made it easier for me to move on ? I grew up with her. I was 15 when we started dating. I changed, she changed, but we still loved each other through everything we went through. I came out to my family so i could introduce her to them. They liked her, how could they not ? 

For my own sake, i decided to go no contact with her. I fight every day to keep the urge to text her away, because somehow i know that shes going through the same feelings as me. Im struggling though, i dont know how to be normal anymore. I feel this emptiness in me that i cannot fill, i cant sleep right, cant eat right, cant get out of bed or do simple chores. I spent time with my family, it worked during the times i was with them, but everytime they leave it just comes back.

1o6s4c9,breaking up with my age gap bf,"I am a 19M in college and was dating a 38M. Today I broke up with him. We‚Äôd been dating for a little over a year, and my parents found out about us, resulting in a breakup. I need advice deciding if I should follow through in the breakup.

We met in my first semester and college and hit it off pretty fast. We decided to pursue a relationship, however we broke up in march seeing no future because of the age gap. We ended up getting back together but pretty much lived a silent relationship(family, friends don‚Äôt know). We pretty much decided on if my family found out then we would most likely break up. My parents told me this weekend they figured out I was dating someone older and made me spill all of the details of our relationship, including that he has a 7M child. He has joint custody so we go one week on and off. My parents aren‚Äôt happy, but they also aren‚Äôt stopping the relationship. They said it was my decision but they don‚Äôt approve of it at all. He also gave me the option without judgement. So, I broke up with him. We had a long discussion about it and I am torn. I love him, but I‚Äôm too afraid to live our relationship out in the open. My parents told me if we stay together they have to meet them. I‚Äôm afraid if we continue I will lose my family and friends over it. But, I also don‚Äôt want to leave him because we are in love and I‚Äôm afraid he won‚Äôt find love again. We are both particular people and he was single for years before we met, then before that dealt with a string of bad relationships. He doesn‚Äôt want to try to find love again unless it‚Äôs with me, and that worries me. He has been an amazing boyfriend and deserves the best.

1o6s0of,"How can someone say ""They deserve better"" after everything they did?","It's been seven months since my breakup, and I still catch myself trying to make sense of it all. My ex lied, gaslighted, manipulated, and cheated. Yet when everything came crashing down, she told me she deserved better. 

That line still messes with my head! How do you hurt someone so deeply and act like you're the victim??? She said she wanted to ""work on herself"" but let's be honest that usually means there's someone else. 

My family believes she will come back. They say a woman never forgets a man who treated her right. But I don't know. I feel like her pride and ego mean more to her than admitting any kind of accountability or saying sorry. 

Sometimes I catch myself wanting to reach out, just to say something, or to see if she really regrets it all. But then I stop myself. Because I don't want to stroke her ego. I also remember she told me after the break up. If I don't leave her alone she's going to the cops. 

Some tarot readings suggested she wants to come back and she regrets everything she did but I just...... I don't know. Maybe I'm overthinking things. 

Still part of me can't help but ask. How can someone say they love you, they want a future with you, but do all these horrible things. Then say they deserved better! I don't get it! Am I missing something?

1o6rmz0,4 months post breakup up/what happened?,"Hello,

I (36M) was dumped by my girlfriend (33F) of 17 months on June 2nd. I was about 5 weeks away from moving across the country to live with her. She meant the world to me, and this completely hit me by surprise. I immediately entered a weird manic state, and everything since then has felt so surreal with big lapses in memories.

For example, my grandmother passed away at the end of May (just a few days before getting dumped), and I suddenly got sad about it today because I almost forgot. I also took a trip that I can't remember that well, and got a new job and moved cities. The memory of all of this seems so foggy, like memories of a movie that you were falling asleep during, or like video game cutscenes that you listened to passively. 

I've felt so disconnected and cloudy for the last few months, and then today it kind of hit me. It was a weird, energetic, miserable, grief filled sadness that I tried to stay busy and on the run to avoid. Now it is a cold, empty, sober sadness that is hard to describe. Has anyone else experienced a post breakup syndrome similar to this? If so, how did you process the grief once your mind returned to normal. Thanks for reading.

1o6rlkc,My relationship is failing due to (mostly) external circumstances.,"I will attempt to keep this long story relatively short. I (28F) and my partner (30M) have been together for a better part of 6 years. He is a single father. Throughout our relationship, his son's mother has been extremely vindictive and has openly had meltdowns, stalking episodes, etc. These meltdowns include finding my phone number, my parents home, and literally crying to his mother (who is equally as toxic as her, if not more) and it ends up creating this unbearable stress for him and I. 

And please understand that I am not trying to show disrespect to her out of respect for him and his son. They never had a relationship, this is not his ex. I am not leaving out pieces of this story to make him or I look better. Genuinely, I have always tried to maintain a level of respect for her out of necessity for his son. I have never engaged in her drama and I have politely told her in the past to leave us alone and blocked her. I never did anything to hurt her even though she was trying to hurt me. Eventually, it all had to get settled via court order. He thought this would make everything a little smoother but somehow it has caused her to spiral out of control again, make verbal threats over the phone, just spewing irrational thoughts onto him. He said he has become paranoid, is constantly looking over his shoulder, and fears that not answering her calls will lead to stalking or worse. 

To conclude, he has told me that all of the stress he is enduring has finally left him paralyzed and emotionally unavailable. In short, he has told me that it would be best if we parted ways so that I do not have to endure anymore of this drama (even though it is only a small fraction of what he deals with). He said that he cannot escape this negativity but maybe I can. That I deserve someone who does not have this sort of drama. I guess I just feel so disappointed that it never got better, and I will not tolerate anyone saying mean things about him. 

He has done everything in his power to keep me away from this drama, and I see where he is coming from with his statements. I just hate that all of these years together, the therapy we completed together, it all doesn't matter anymore because ultimately our relationship doesn't seem to be salvageable.

1o6rksn,Breakups and Avoidant Attatchment,"hi, this is my first time making a reddit post, and im doing this in hopes that this subreddit can act as a support group. last night my boyfriend called me and told me that our relationship was one sided (it was) as he could not give me what I needed. He lacked desire to text me and to call me; I was the one basically doing all of the work, because I still loved him. We dated for 2 years, our anniversary was late august, and he is a freshman in college currently while im a high school senior, so we were in LDR. i was willing to do it, and despite the pain it was worth it to me knowing i looked forward to our future and his visits, but he could not do it anymore. he saw it as a routine and he didnt want to upkeep the routine anymore. the first thing he said over the phone was that he reflected deeply for two weeks, meaning he was figuring out how to break up with me, and his lack of effort was evident even before the LDR, the LDR just added fuel to fire. I understood from the beginning first loves never last, especially HS sweethearts, but our relationship besides his dimming of effort towards the end was great. i was truly happy and in love which is why i didnt see the signs. i thought we'd be HS sweethearts... i was so naive. he dropped this bomb on me, and i couldnt have predicted it for my life. i dont know if i ever want to date an avoidant person again, they ghost you and then dump this without warning thinking THEYRE DOING THE RIGHT THING. he didnt. ive felt empty all day, and had a panic attack earlier screaming and crying. i hate having to go through this while dealing with life (work, college apps, etc.) i lost my person. it truly feels like the end of the world. ive already deleted every trace of him from my phone as thats my way of protecting myself. i just want to interact with people who have overcame this, and i pray i dont feel this way for months and months.",Most-Swordfish-5184,1760475483.0,1,0.99,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o6rksn/breakups_and_avoidant_attatchment/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o6rksn/breakups_and_avoidant_attatchment/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False

1o6rjlf,"They Are Wrong, And it Sucks","I‚Äôm 4 weeks out of a 5 year relationship. I know she‚Äôs wrong.

She is a very outgoing person, loves to socialize and meet people, always posting a ton, definitely likes to drink and party. Honestly I loved it about her and she got me to truly be myself at times. The problem at hand here is this: She truly has issues with validation. She never physically cheated, but she pushes the limits emotionally. A phrase people use to describe her is ‚Äúpick-me girl.‚Äù She can‚Äôt just meet someone new, she has to be their new favorite person. She did things that would start fights in a lot of relationships, and it did for us at times, but honestly I looked past it all as it was never physically cheating and was more so just her personality and needing the validation that people like her. I loved her for her and she was open about these issues, she at times said she could see how it‚Äôs hard for me but truly never worked on herself. It made me sad at times that everything I provided still wasn‚Äôt enough to feed her need to be validated.

She broke up with me over it. She said she feels she is walking on eggshells, feels I am judging her, and that she does not see herself with me when I am frustrated with some of these things. At home with just us, she is really my favorite person. She‚Äôs calm, relaxed, loving, caring, and has so many fun little hobbies I loved doing with her. It‚Äôs almost like an alter-ego in social settings that she just turns that all off and acts completely different.

It‚Äôs been hard for me, I always supported her. We definitely fought at times in the final 3 months. Seeing her walk away and convince herself that she needs to be that other version of herself is sad. She‚Äôs partied nonstop with new people since the breakup. We were setting ourselves up for such a good life, and she discarded me and essentially said she would be unable to change that side of her and needs someone who can handle it. I don‚Äôt see myself as insecure, but like I said she really did push the limits at times that others noticed as well.

I have a ton of support from all of our friends that I am not in the wrong. But still, it hurts to watch from the outside. Her family adores me and mine her, I have a steady career that was really about to take off. We had life plans, a house, wedding venue, a dog. Now it‚Äôs all gone away because she has convinced herself she needs to be that version. She parties constantly and frankly embarrasses herself on social media (not just me saying this fyi).

- also I am sorry if there are similar stories line this on here - I hope I won‚Äôt get downvoted-

I (19M) have been in a relationship for 2.5 years and my girlfriend (20F) recently broke up with me. I know that the relationship itself wasn‚Äôt really healthy (at least for me) since I have a pretty anxious attachment style and am extremely emotionally attached. 

Example: If she was in a bad mood I was always scared whether it was my fault. If she didn‚Äôt answer for like 6-8+ hours I couldn‚Äôt think straight cause I was so scared I did something wrong. 

I have always been an extremely social person and my gf and me saw each other like every second day and texted everyday. 

She was always my #1 priority and I have always been extremely scared of her breaking up with me. There is no way I could have given her anything more - she had all my attention, I tried to surprise her regularly and even did stuff I don‚Äôt like just cause I knew she liked it. 

We had (and still have) a great relationship- talked about all our worries and struggles and tried helping each other. Of course there were ups and downs but I feel like we dealt with everything in a healthy and pretty mature way. We basically never had any fights - sometimes disagreements but never anything where we would be rude to another. 

When she broke up with me she told me she had realized that she had lost her romantic feelings for me over the past months (I‚Äôd say one could realize it but somehow I missed all the hints) but she still thinks that I am a great person and she would be really happy to be friends with me some day (if that‚Äôs possible for me). 

Obviously I still love her - it‚Äôs only been around a week since the breakup but since then I have realized so many unhealthy habits about myself and they make it extremely hard for me to deal with this situation.

- Everyone told me to do things for myself, but I feel like I never did so. That sounds kind of weird but I was never really able to have fun on my own. I play a lot of guitar and write my own music but I am not able to find happiness in that.

- I feel like I‚Äôve been somewhat like some guy in the Sahara or something who was always thirsty and she was the only one who would give me something to drink. (Water as an image for Motivation, happiness, and just a feeling of wellbeing). It seems like there is no way I can give this to myself. I try to take walks, I play with my dog, I play guitar, I sing, I draw, I meet with friends. Nothing really does anything. It feels like everything I ever did was just to make her happy and like me

- She was like my girlfriend and bestfriend all in one - I never met anyone who would understand me this well and It never felt so good talking to someone - I could tell her ANYTHING and it was NEVER embarrassing. I don‚Äôt have that with my other friends. I feel kind of bad - my friends are great but not at all close to what my girlfriend was able to give me

I‚Äôd love to be friends with her because I feel like this connection was more than just an average relationship (I know I am really young and don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs yet to come - but I never sensed anything comparable in any of the couples I knew)
We have so many similar interests, both make music, like the same bands, like the same movies, like the same games, love cats, are creative, have great insiders, extremely nieche YouTube videos no one knows. I don‚Äôt want to lose all of this because I know a friendship could be great!

However I know - as long as I feel that I MUST be friends with her I am not ‚Äûfree‚Äú from my romantical feelings, emotional attachments and bad habits I developed.

A good friend told me ‚Äûoften you are ready for a friendship after relationship not when you think you need it but when you feel like you don‚Äôt need it anymore‚Äú (this is the only helpful tip I‚Äôve got)

So currently I try to learn to be happy on my own for what feels like the first time ever in my life but it is extremely hard to let go off everything first. I know the thought of being friends with her would help me and motivate me - but it only does so since I still love her and just want to spend time with her. I want to learn to find happiness and motivation on my own.

1o6r794,Please someone give me some guidance!,"Hi all. I‚Äôm new to Reddit and haven‚Äôt posted anything before so I‚Äôm sorry for not knowing the rules‚Ä¶

I wanted to post on here because I am struggling and I mean REALLY struggling with my most recent break up. To give some context we both moved into a shared apartment and met through our living situation.  We ended up being together around 9 months and seeing each other every day, whilst also going away on holiday together, going abroad to visit my family, and going on other trips just me and her. 

We shared a lot of amazing memories together and nothing traumatic/bad happened between us - we moved out of the shared apartment into our own living arrangement for a couple of weeks and we eventually decided that it wasn‚Äôt working so mutually broke up. 

There were some differences between us: I was an extrovert and she was more introverted, she was more structured in life and liked routine whereas I valued spontaneity and flexibility, but the biggest part of our difference was that I felt like because of these traits I had to conform more towards her way of life and because her job was so stressful/demanding, I accepted that we go to sleep early and wake up early etc (in other words I felt like i comprised myself more in the relationship to make sure she was content) There was also a difference in our supposed ‚Äòlove languages‚Äô. I really like physical touch and I think she was more acts of service. Unfortunately as this was the case, I ended up feeling quite rejected by her as the evenings mainly consisted of her rigid routine and ensuring she was prepared for the work day ahead, which didn‚Äôt leave much time for affection apart from having sex regularly, and feeling as though she was never truly present to be with me. 

It‚Äôs been a month since we were together and I miss her more than anything! We have gone no contact and I haven‚Äôt been checking her social media, doing anything toxic and have been living a pretty healthy lifestyle. But the love that we shared and the attachment between us feels so brutal just to give up. 

I suppose I‚Äôm just looking for some opinions here? Of course I really want to reach out and message but I know that‚Äôs not productive, but at the same time it just feels strange living in my own little bubble whilst she is also living in her bubble. I would prefer that we were in the same bubble! We were aligned on the future for marriage kids etc, so I guess i‚Äôm just confused.

Thanks everyone!

1o6r5ko,People with attachment issues need to heal before getting into relationships,"Like I said in title. This goes for EVERYONE. Avoidant and anxious. Both are still bad. Don't string someone along and bring your baggage into each others' closets and expect to heal while you're navigating a relationship. Especially if that relationship plans to be serious. 

So many people go out with these attachment tendencies and then act surprised when things don't work out. I've dated avoidants and anxious people. Avoidants, from my perspective, aren't ready AT ALL to make a simple commitment. It's easy for them to say and plan things but doing it is something else. In the end, you'll just blame yourself for wasting your time. Anxious ones aren't ready to accept certain situations/circumstances and they start to get impulsive with their actions without factoring in practicality and logic. 

I get that people want to connect and feel wanted but if you can't even connect with yourself in a healthy manner, how can you do that with other people? You're not just hurting yourself but you're also hurting others. You're wasting your time and theirs.

It is literally OKAY to take your time and HEAL. Attachment issues are attachment ISSUES for a reason. It isn't a quirky, ""haha, let me not take this seriously"" moment. It's an ISSUE. People forget to factor in their mental wellbeing into dating and it's frustrating. It shouldn't be used as an excuse for their actions. It can justify some of their actions to a certain degree, but if they're not doing anything to fix it then what the hell? It should be a reason to take time for themselves without jumping the gun to get with a secure person then fuck them up too.

Months ago I posted here about how miserable I was and how bad I wanted him back. I thought my world had ended. I thought I needed closure. But this is all the closure I needed. 

For those of you struggling, it really does get better. I promise.

P.s. I didn't open the folder. Never open sketchy links. And pirating games is bad, m'kay?",lamp-l1ghter,1760474334.0,30,1.0,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o6r29a/he_actually_came_back/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o6r29a/he_actually_came_back/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False

1o6qxwu,ex misses me,"it's been 93 days since so what hppned was she kinda moved on plus kinda also because of the new guy right after the break up. On oct 1 we talked and it was kinda harsh i was expecting she misses me or smthn but she was a bit hard idk what i was expecting still, she said all the stuff like ""glad it ended""  etc. this got me to water down the relationship in my own mind because it was totally not like her i was lit crying n shi. but seeing her not caring clicked smthn in me. 

idk maybe because the new guy was actually good to her then after she also tweeted how she is excited she is going to meet him after so many days. that hurt. 

but what happened 2 days back i again mssged her smthn out of spite bec she rtweted smthn it felt like an atk on me i thought we ended it on good term then why bs again i prolly shudnt have. then after a bit of casual arguments we kinda slipped into our old joking mode (i complemented her humour or smtn maybe because she felt appreciated or smt as she had a praising thing)then she said how she misses me and said things which completely contradicted her previous oct 1 talking with me then she told me how she wish it was me n how her current fling is not like me that she misses me 

i just don't know what to think of it guys is she going to relapse? i know ppl always say smthn at start and then their mind changes i don't know why i thought it wouldn't hppn with her maybe because the way she convinced me how she would never reconcile when i asked this during the breakup(i know she won't) but her saying she miss me and still wish it was me is a deal breaker to hear after what she said on oct 1.

1o6qroy,We‚Äôre over again,"I learned as of recently my bf now ex(M27) & i (F24) both have fearful avoidant attachment styles. His leaning more into avoidant than anxious & meaning leaning more into anxious than avoidant. Anyways after our first breakup i brought it to his attention so that he can be aware of it & know how to go from there. 

Our first breakup; he broke up with me & pushed me away because he was scared & it started feeling too real. He hasn‚Äôt been in a relationship in 3 years, he‚Äôs used to being alone. I don‚Äôt know if he thought somebody getting close again meant that person seeing parts of yourself that you don‚Äôt want anybody else to see, maybe parts of yourself that you have to work on as well. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with that of course but change is scary to a lot of people. Again nothing wrong with change we should always want to change certain aspects of ourselves to grow into a better version of ourselves right ? Anyways i did write him a 9 page letter telling him how i do love him & that i believed our chapter wasn‚Äôt finished & that he shouldn‚Äôt push me away & that i understand him. I touched base on a lot of underlying things about himself he didn‚Äôt think i knew or would understand. 

Anyhow, we did end up getting back together again; he told me he‚Äôs been going about it so wrong & he asked God for a sign if he has & right then was when i texted him asking him if he received the letter. Ironic timing haha. We talked about it on the phone & so we decided to give it another go, a fresh start. We met up that same night & went for a walk at a pier & just talk. That following night we went out to the movies & everything was all good. We told each other we were going to be more transparent in our relationship. He came home from work the next day & i could tell his energy was off i asked him what‚Äôs wrong, he communicated to me that he‚Äôs not use to coming home to somebody being there & that it‚Äôs kind of uncomfortable. I told him i appreciated him telling me & asked him if he ever felt this way other previous times i stood over & he said yes. I respected his honesty, didn‚Äôt get mad. We both agreed that it‚Äôs something he just has to open up getting used to after a while. 

Everything was still going good. Something came up in our relationship that i had found out that happened 2 days before our first break up. I was upset about it, came to him about it & we talked it out & he told me everything. He gave me the option whether i wanted to stay or leave. I decided i wanted to stay & work through it together. He also said he still wanted this relationship as well; it was something workable. My trust was broken though. In a sense during that talk he kind of made it seem like earning my trust again was too much work. Which is crazy because if i decide to forgive you & we both decide we still want the relationship, then that should be a given to work for. We barely argued for real but the times we would have disagreements & uncomfortable conversations where we wouldn‚Äôt see eye to eye would kind of be scary again. Cause in the back of my mind i‚Äôm thinking ‚Äòwhat if he pushes me away again ?‚Äô ‚ÄòWhat if he tells himself he doesn‚Äôt want this again?‚Äô In a sense it felt like walking on eggshells. I‚Äôm a very confrontational person about a lot of things. Communication is always key especially in a relationship. How else could you solve an issue & find common ground ? 

At this point, we were in an okay area in our relationship, not all the way good & not all the way bad. But it could be worse. We had a disagreement on the phone about the way he goes about wanting his ‚Äòspace‚Äô. Space is good & healthy yes of course; i just didn‚Äôt like the way he‚Äôd go about it sometimes. Like selfishly as if he were still single i don‚Äôt know. He would use that same space to push me out & isolate himself during times we‚Äôd disagree & it‚Äôd become bigger than what it was. We had a conversation about it & told me he was going to stop doing that & go about things differently. Which would only last a couple days to a week before he‚Äôd do it again towards me after another argument. Another argument where breaking up as a solution was brought up from him once again. 

Throughout our relationship i told him many times that we‚Äôre going to trigger parts of each other, sometimes not always bad neither. But parts of one another that come to the surface that we may still need to work on. Your partner mirrors you, mirrors parts of yourself you haven‚Äôt healed/worked on yet. I also told him plenty of times that when we don‚Äôt see eye to eye & have disagreements; we‚Äôre never against each other & it‚Äôs never suppose to feel like such. The point is to not combat one another. We‚Äôre on the same team & it is us VS the issue at hand. We may not agree on somethings but the point is to try & put each other in one another‚Äôs shoes & find common ground. I also told him that we‚Äôre going to hold each other accountable, point out things about each other cause sometimes you may not realize certain things about yourself or something you‚Äôre doing in the moment. I told him let‚Äôs go about things like this & a lot of other things a certain way, you know like the healthy ways in a relationship so that we can maintain a healthy relationship. I would always try to do so & point that out during times i seen him backsliding into his old thinking/ways. The same ways he said he was trying to grow from & not do anymore. Granted everybody is human so nobody is perfect, it‚Äôs not an overnight process which i understand which is why i always tried to be so patient with him & give him grace & call it out when he would do certain things again. 

Once again he decided i was right & still wanted to be in the relationship & this time be ‚Äúmore willing‚Äù because he got advice from the mother of his child about himself, which i tried not to be mad about & which i felt he should‚Äôve been the minute he got into a relationship but whatever. We had a whole conversation about our relationship again, touched based on a lot. Things we won‚Äôt be doing, mainly him saying things he won‚Äôt do & wants to do differently. So me having faith in him & our relationship i decided ok let‚Äôs move forward which is me giving him grace once again. So everything is going good again between us again; we‚Äôre going good spending more time with each other again. I leave his place, later that night i sent something to him & told him that i love him. He then leaves me there & 20 minutes later posted the Giants win on his story. I received no text from him the rest of the night. He usually doesn‚Äôt fall asleep that early nor leave me in his inbox like he did so i did feel a way. Texted again saying ‚Äú????‚Äù Almost 2 hrs later. No reply. Next morning he texts me asking whats the question marks for & that he fell asleep. No good morning, no apology no nothing. I‚Äôm expressing to him how his actions bothered me/kind of hurt my feelings. At that point logic is out the window. Instead of trying to understand me & where i‚Äôm coming from, he goes back & forth with me about it. It becomes a combative debate i don‚Äôt know how. He‚Äôs saying he doesn‚Äôt agree with me so why would he try & make the situation better ? At that point i feel as if i lost my boyfriend fr this time. I tried explaining to him he‚Äôs not going about it the right way & it just felt like a lack of consideration once again. It felt so unfair because in any situation i would consider him & his feelings. 

We did end up breaking up once again later that night. He told me he doesn‚Äôt think ‚Äòhe‚Äôs as invested as i am‚Äô which felt like a literal slap to the face. Our whole relationship & the breaking up & getting back together each time he realized he was wrong. All i ever tried to do was be the glue in our relationship. Help us to both grow & heal & realize our faults. Make sure we‚Äôre doing things the correct way, yes we‚Äôre going to mess up but as long as we learn & maintain a healthy relationship. He always saw it as me trying to get him to do things ‚Äúmy way‚Äù instead & that was never the intention. I just felt as if at the point he was projecting & deflecting. Trying to make me seem like the problem in the relationship instead. Yes i wasn‚Äôt perfect neither, yes i had my faults but i would take accountability for it. I would still give so much grace, consideration & understanding. In the end it feels like i played myself, like i got the shit end of the stick. You‚Äôd think that being all that plus loving, kind, nurturing, loyal, all the qualities in a woman you‚Äôd want would make you realize you got something you wouldn‚Äôt want to lose. Especially when he was telling his friends i‚Äôm the woman he sees himself with long term. Only to get pushed away & discarded once again & for good it seems this time. It hurts when somebody you love decides to accept their inner wounds/trauma who make up who they are today instead of growing & healing into a man. I realized i tried to help him grow & heal parts of himself out of the love & care i have for him while also trying to do the same for myself. In the end it felt as if i was the one taking lead in the relationship at times instead.

I feel so stuck. I can't let go and I've been trying so hard, praying, journaling, not looking at socials etc. I don't know what to do anymore. I look at his reposts sometimes and it's all about how happy he is with his new girl and that they pray for eatch other and he just gives her the love I wanted from him.

1o6qjp3,"My ex (27F) and I (24M) broke up after 3 years ‚Äî she emotionally cheated and moved on fast, but I still can‚Äôt let go","Me 24m and my Ex 27fm broke up after a 3 year relationship. we started having issues with miscommunication and arguments a year before the break up.  she was my first in just about everything and i really don't hate her and still wish for some way to fix this all.

We first met when i was in college at a random dorm party everything seemed so nice and at first it was like the gods had picked us to meet. we matched in everything from video games to interests. i even thought that she was the most beautiful and amazing woman i had ever met. when we did meet tho she still had her ex around and even still was messing around with him but i stuck through that and forgave it. we weren't dating yet so i just focused on building the relationship and a few months later we were dating. i completely did everything i could for her, random visits, gifts, compliments, and paragraphs for months. it definitely was love bombing and it was my first relationship but honestly i really thought she was the one.  it was everyday just for motivation on how good she was doing during her worst times to bring up her confidence. she was working a part time job and at the time finishing school. she was just getting started in her career path and i was there every step to boost her confidence after the last ex had ""left her worse than ever"" we spent a lot of time talking and communicating because she is bipolar and i have abandonment and anxiety issues like crazy. i always asked for reassurance like constant gn/gm and ""I love yous"" all the time because of my stuff and she has a short fuse and can be up and down in how she is feeling. we got through the first 2 years fine. she was telling me how I'm the one and i was going all in on her. i was there for everything she did or needed. she had many irrational blowups and i showed up no matter what i had happening. i even helped remodel her room for her by buying a new gaming pc desk and paying $1000 for a steam vr index which will come back later. i did all this while rarely getting equal back and being ok with just going off the fact that the relationship would get better in the future. we rarely had intimacy ever without it being some planned thing that she had to feel ok with. there was one time she heard me on the phone saying how nice it would be to see her wearing lingerie and when i walked into her house she was actually wearing it, we get into her bedroom after making out for a lil and she starts putting her clothes on and asking if we can go get food.... and I actually did and just went home after. there are more stories i could go over but I stayed with her through everything and our only issue was really that we argued a lot. I am self aware enough to realize that i am a man child and honestly i really do need to get my emotions in check cause i was just was emotional and cried a lot. i was scared of everything. i never got angry and i don't have a hateful bone in me

I also would just want her to show me some sort love or affection like i would for her. i tried everything i could from physical to emotional but nothing got her turned on for me. She had told me about her past and everything she used to do with other guys also so i was also a little jealous always because she had done more intimately with her ex and the guys before me than with me ever. but we get to the last 6 months of my relationship and we are a arguing all the time about how much time she is spending on video games and how she is emotionally drained from everything but still we are trying to work through it. 

My first dog a golden doodle named Charlie got brain cancer in June. I asked her if she could come around more than usual so that i could have someone to help spend time while him until he passed. thankfully he is still alive today and the vets have no idea how, this cancer should have killed him months ago but he is a tank. during that time she assured me she would and just never showed up more. it was always some excuse or thing that happened. i eventually got mad at her and she broke up with me first and then gets back together for a lil. i have a mental breakdown crying and my parents find out and just don't like her because they think she just uses me. the day after this my ex and mom get into a fight about how both of them don't treat me right and it explodes so not my ex can not come over or talk to my family. i then break up with her because i just was like maybe a break will help a lil and she agreed that time working on ourselves would work. after the break up we went on a date a week later cause it was for our actual 3 year anniversary so we just wanted to go still at the time and both agreed to just take the break and work slow until we cleared our lives to date again. a week after on Saturday she went a bar one night met a guy got his number and then told me she wasn't gonna go on the date. on Sunday she tells me everything but assures me that she wasn't going on the date and that she would be there for me if i needed her. she hung up the phone and then went on the date with the guy. i had her location still so i saw it all and was blowing up her phone. the guy she was with the takes it and sends a picture of her looking up at him. that shit is forever burned into my head and says don't worry about it anymore ill take care of her. i at first just blocked her on everything but after a day gave up and tried to talk to her again. she blocked the guy completely and apologized for it all just trying to say she doesn't know why she did it it was just for her self and that she is sorry. i understand that she was single and can go on dates but i just don't get someone can do that. its been a few months now and I've just recently learned also that during the time i needed her for my dog she was on VRChat with the vr headset i bought dirty talking with guys and flirting with them till 4am and drinking.  she now for the last month has been telling me how drained and dis attached she is and how its caused a 180 out of nowhere its almost like I'm chasing her. she is completely ok it seems with me gone and is just kind of done it seems. i try every day with the same things i pulled her with but she just seems so gone that i cant even connect with her

i really am just trying to see if there is anyway i can repair this. i know I should hate her but she's my first and i still talk to her every day.

1o6qevp,Just Need To Vent,"I‚Äôve never posted on here before, but I feel like I‚Äôm drowning and I just need to vent.

I (29nb) recently (1 month ago) broke up with my partner (38nb) after we‚Äôd been together for about a year. I read people on here taking about how things are so much easier for the person who broke it off, but I‚Äôm not sure I agree.

I didn‚Äôt want to break it off. I wanted to work on it. But they just‚Ä¶ couldn‚Äôt seem to stop pushing me away every time things got better. We were stuck in this cycle and for 1,000,000 reasons, there was no emotional safety for me in this attachment, so I ended it. 

And now it‚Äôs ending me. 

I mean, that‚Äôs really fucking dramatic and I know that it‚Äôs not the end of me and one day I‚Äôll be fine, but I‚Äôm really really fucking sad and I miss the good parts of what we had so much. 

I‚Äôm angry, too, because I hate that I was put into the position of having to break up with them when it was they who let the relationship fail, they who kept breaking my trust and hurting me and they who could not simply say ‚ÄúI will do better.‚Äù They‚Äôd just whine about how they were going to try and then go right back to behaving‚Ä¶ like a child, tbh. 

And I know I‚Äôm so much better off and I know I deserved better than how they treated me most of the time, but I‚Äôm struggling because‚Ä¶ what if they could have changed? But then, if they could, why the fuck didn‚Äôt they? I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm just really hurting‚Ä¶ from the relationship ending but also from all the hurt that was never healed or repaired while we were together. There were times when they treated me like I was less than nothing to them, while swearing that they loved me so much and that I was one of the best things that ever happened to them. 

For so many reasons, I really do think I didn‚Äôt mean much to them. I think I was a distraction from their failing marriage and that I was really fucking good at making them feel good. Until I started asking for some ‚Äúfeel good‚Äù in return and then I guess it was all too much. How dare I ask to be (checks notes) respected and seen by my partner? 

I‚Äôm mad at myself for letting this person make me feel like trash. I‚Äôm mad at myself for hearing all their red flags and thinking it was merely a self-perception issue and not that they actually were selfish and unkind. I‚Äôm mad at myself for still being sad about this. I‚Äôm mad at them for not giving me an opportunity to love them for who they were or to just‚Ä¶ opt out because our needs and interests didn‚Äôt align.

Why did they lie about who they were and what they wanted to give me in a relationship? 
Why did I fucking believe them? 

I‚Äôm so broken about this and I don‚Äôt know what to do. I want comfort from the very cause of this. I‚Äôm not reaching out for it, though. I‚Äôm keeping communication to a minimum, I‚Äôve blocked them on Instagram so I can post as much moody shit as I want, blah blah blah.

I know this post is aimless. I‚Äôm fucking aimless. I can only spend so many days sitting with my feelings and journalling and talking to my inner child and holding space for myself and ‚Äúdoing the healthy thing.‚Äù

I just wanted things to be different. I wanted them to fix the damage. I wanted THEM to hold ME and tell ME everything was going to be okay for fucking once. I‚Äôm so tired from having carried the whole thing on my shoulders for so long, I don‚Äôt know how to heal from it now. 

I guess that‚Äôs all I have to say about it for now. 
If you read all of this, thank you.

1o6qbd4,I can‚Äôt make a new start,"3 years ago I (then 21m ) broke up with the longest and most toxic  relationship I ever had , 3 years to be exact. Let‚Äôs call her kata (then 22f) . I was young and foolish but we had our problems . During that relationship I let myself go (went from incredibly fit and social to essentially fat and without any social life, at least in that city  ). I started from scratch but I mentally was in a very dark place . I  made new friends and about three months I met Sia (20f) . At this point I should mention I have ASD . Sia studying to become a social worker not only found interest in me for my ASD but she made me feel good about having , pointing out all the good qualities I have from it  and for the first time in my life I didn‚Äôt feel cursed . After getting gradually closer we started hooking up . Even though we didn‚Äôt have any common hobbies I could spend my entire day with her and enjoy every second of it . After about 2 months I asked her if she wanted to be my girlfriend and she rejected me but wanted to continue as is . I didn‚Äôt mind just spending time with her was enough for me . After she realized she had feeling for me she ghosted me for a week saying she doesn‚Äôt want to speak to me anymore . We eventually got back together but I was very upset with the whole ghosting thing . One day  she told me she was fooling around with other people  because we didn‚Äôt have anything official , which proved to be a lie to make jealous which I learned about 2 months  after the whole thing took place . A couple hours later we talking and she asked me to become an official couple . I of course rejected that offer even though I was severely in love with her , I felt so betrayed that day . In the heat of the moment I told her because I valued her as a friend and I didn‚Äôt want to lose her from my life to message me when she got over me . A couple of weeks passed by and we started hanging out again and let‚Äôs just say we weren‚Äôt very good at being *exes* . But this time she told me she was completely over me (I still had feeling for her )and that she just wanted to keep having fun . After fooling around for another two weeks I wake up to a text saying that she was still deeply in love with me and that it pained her to see me not recognizing that (at this moment I should remind you I have ASD ) , my answer was ‚Äúyou said you were over me and that you had fooled around with others ‚Äú. I then asked to come by my place to talk about it but she never replied to said text(the last time we talked ) . About 2 months after that I was getting hit on by a neighbor of mine (19f) and I though that she might help me get over Sia and she was genuinely a good person but I couldn‚Äôt make a connection with her so we ended up stopping only a couple months in . That was two years ago and to this day even though I have been through lots of self improvement (both physically and mentally) I just can‚Äôt bring myself to try anything with any girl (even though I have had over 15 or so opportunities to do so ) . I feel stuck in the past and I am afraid that I won‚Äôt be able to connect with any of them or even if I do that it won‚Äôt work out at the end just like my situationship with Sia . Any help  

PS: I have been hit on almost  a dozen times this past year alone but I can‚Äôt bring myself to try anything .

1o6py74,Is it normal to feel nothing after a 7 year old relationship?,"I just got dumped after a 7-year relationship, and I‚Äôm honestly so confused about my emotions. The first day, it felt like my world had ended. I thought I would never be able to live without him. But now, just over a week later, I feel‚Ä¶ nothing. No sadness, no longing, not even emptiness. I feel a mix of relief, curiosity, and hope for the future. And I can‚Äôt help but feel a little guilty about that.

Our relationship was stormy and full of problems. We were on the verge of breaking up countless times. I often felt like I was the ‚Äúproblem‚Äù, that everything that went wrong was my fault, that I always had to change for us to work. Whenever I brought up things he did that hurt me, it somehow became my fault. I tried everything to improve myself, but it was never enough. He would mock me during arguments and use our age difference to belittle me. It left me doubting my feelings, my worth, and even who I was.

We met when I was 17 and he was 24. I was in a very dark place at the time, and he quickly became my only source of stability. I became deeply attached to him, maybe too quickly. I think my identity was shaped around him, I was dependent on him emotionally and practically. He was my safety net, my world. I honestly don‚Äôt know who I am without him.

I thought about leaving him many times but never did. I‚Äôm not sure if it was love or just fear of being alone, or maybe both. Ending a relationship with someone you‚Äôve been with for most of your life is terrifying, even when it made you unhappy.

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs confusing me: I feel nothing. The anxiety I had in our relationship is gone, and I feel free. I feel hope. I want to find myself and explore who I am without him. But how is it possible to feel so little after seven years? Is it normal to feel relief so soon after a long relationship?

I‚Äôve also recently slept with someone else, and it felt amazing. I enjoyed it without guilt or thinking about my ex. During my relationship, I often had very low libido, which was one of our problems. I always thought it was just me, but now I think I had already lost attraction to him long before the breakup. Exploring this part of myself feels liberating, like I‚Äôm reclaiming a piece of me that was missing.

I‚Äôm struggling to make sense of all this. Maybe I processed the relationship subconsciously before it ended. Maybe it‚Äôs a defense mechanism protecting me from the pain I ‚Äúshould‚Äù feel. Or maybe it‚Äôs a sign that the relationship was holding me back, and now I finally feel the freedom to grow.

I don‚Äôt want to deny what we had, but I also don‚Äôt want to feel guilty for not being heartbroken. Is it possible to be ‚Äúdone‚Äù with someone after so many years, even if you thought you loved them? Has anyone else felt nothing after a long, intense, sometimes toxic relationship? I just want to understand if what I feel is normal, or if I should be worried about my emotional response.",Life_Earth_1017,1760471847.0,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o6py74/is_it_normal_to_feel_nothing_after_a_7_year_old/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o6py74/is_it_normal_to_feel_nothing_after_a_7_year_old/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o6prkt,I am heartbroken!!!,"I ¬†got married very young.I have been married for long time with three grown kids. I have lived abroad for a long time.A loveless marriage with very insecure husband who was never there for raising kids or be a friend or any form of support throughout. We lived in the same house as strangers and roommates throughout and stayed together for the sake of kids .The kids recently graduated and moved out . My husband moved back to India to take care of his parents last year in April. I was even more alone and depressed and started working on one of my passions which is singing and started singing on popular karoke apps. I was singing duets with random people. Never put my pic or original name anywhere. Last september i joined some invites from one of the most mesmerizing voices i encountered . One day i got a message from that man saying if i could improve on my timing sense in singing i would sound amazing. We started chatting casually and became very very close. I shared my insta profile and real identity only wit him We vibed so well in many areas. He was a bit younger than me and had a kid in 8 th grade. He lives in an Asian country close to India. Also started chatting with him on whatsapp. He shared that his kid had a chronic illness and is on continuous treatment and he got into a huge amount of medical debt in that country. I was really feeling bad for his state and decided to help him. I had planned a trip to India in December and told him i wanted to meet him and rerouted my flight and stayed four days with him. Those were the best days of my life . I had taken expensive gifts and also some cash to help support his debt situation. I went to India and was terribly missing him. We contiinued talking and i started sending him regular money to help clear his debt and his kids treatment. This continued until May and suddenly there was one girl with a sweet voice who starrted joining his collabs and was leaving very cheesy comments , like I feel butterflies when i hear your voice etc etc. He was off from the platform for sometime and came back in June and suddenly noticed he was joining more of her collabs . She joined a popular singing training group he was part of and was participating in competitions against each other in different teams. My friend /lover also started a new job in May and claimed he was extremely busy. The phone calls dropped to once a week in June and all whatasapp engagemenrts were also initiated by me and the responses were very muted. The last we talked on phone was in July . I kept sending money thinking that he is busy and doesnt have time . But then i see him commenting on her songs and listening to them like over 50 of them . Average 3 min. Time passed and all conversation initiations were onesided and his responses were muted. In all this he would always sometimes be the only one who comments on her collabs. I stalked that girl and found that she was a widow. I continued sending him money through all this for supporting him. But felt something is really off . I confronted him and sent him a text asking if he is done with me few days back and his response was our affar is indirectlly affecting my kids health and i m feeling guilty So i cant promise to be anything other than a friend . My heart broke and i started going into deep depression about 10 days back . It was soo bad that i was not doing anything at home. cooking cleaning or taking care of myself. I m not sure what his relationship with that girl is can not ask him , but I today saw a playlist she created with their joint collabs which says ""My musical heartbeats"" . It broke me soooo badly and i cried for 3 hours continuously and decided to write this. I know i cant recover the money. But there is no monetary value to the pain i am going through with this situation and cant even share it with anyone.

1o6pmo4,Should I separate yes or no?,"It all started when I was still dating my now-husband. Back then, the relationship was new, and I really believed he was different. But one day, by chance, I ended up seeing him liking photos and videos of women on social media, and even commenting on one of them saying he'd love to hook up with her. At that moment, it was a shock. I confronted him, he apologized, and I ‚Äî trying to believe it was just a ""silly thing"" ‚Äî decided to forgive and move on.

Later on, when we got engaged, I thought things had changed. That now he was more mature, more committed. But it didn't take long until I discovered another situation: he and a friend were talking about a girl his friend was seeing, and the friend commented that this girl had sent him photos. The problem? My fianc√© replied saying that she also sent him sexy photos. Once again, I felt betrayed, even without any ""physical cheating."" I was devastated, but since the wedding was already planned, I decided to forgive again, believing that things would get better after the wedding.

Now, already married, I thought we were at peace. But recently, I ended up snooping on his phone ‚Äî and I found another conversation that destroyed me inside. I saw him replying to a girl's stories, saying that they'd known each other for a long time, but had never met in person, and that they hadn't hooked up yet just because they hadn't had the opportunity.

That left me speechless. I tried to talk to him, asked if he really thought our marriage was still worth it after all this. And his answer was:

""Because I can't be a jerk, nor a liar. I messed up and I don't think it's fair to have to beg for forgiveness, even if I wanted to.""

That sentence kept echoing in my head. He acknowledges he messed up, but he speaks with such pride that he doesn't seem to care about how I'm feeling. He doesn't show remorse, doesn't try to fix things ‚Äî he just admits the mistake and acts as if that's enough.",Tasty_Comparison9927,1760471145.0,2,1.0,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o6pmo4/should_i_separate_yes_or_no/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o6pmo4/should_i_separate_yes_or_no/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False

1o6pkl2,I think I got cheated on?,"Hey guys, I am 20M and just got dumped from an almost 4-year relationship in the end of July. I was devastated, but tried not to think much of it since she was going to college far away and thought that might have been the reason for the breakup. Before I get into details, let me give you guys some backstory. One of my good friends from high school helped me get a job, and we would go to the gym together and were more than just acquaintances, but never really close friends. This friend left my job and went to work somewhere else, when my girlfriend at the time was looking for a job I helped her connect with my friend, and they started working together. I thought it was lovely since she didn't have any friends (literally 1). They would work together a lot, and I never thought much of it since my friend had a girlfriend as well.

Around the same time I got broken up with, my friend stopped hanging out with our friend group and started to feel more distant. At the same time him and his girlfriend broke up, I am not sure about the exact timeline, but I am sure it is within the same month that I got dumped. I always thought in the back of my head that something fishy could happen, but I never thought my friend would do this to me. Two nights ago I opened up Instagram and on his story he is at a concert in the exact city that my ex moved to. In the photo, it looked like he is in a relationship with this new girl (you couldn't see the face). Well, I realized immediately that this girl is the same girl that just dumped me. If my ex started working in June with him, and then they both become single by August, and then are dating by October, I must have gotten emotionally or physically cheated on?

Looking for some advice on if I should try to figure this out or let it be. When I got dumped, it was so devastating, but I had so many great people around me to help me. I deleted all the photos in my camera roll the same night, I removed her on all social platforms or anywhere that I could see her. I stopped smoking weed and started to go to the gym more. Furthermore, I started a business with my friend, I am about to get my personal trainer certificate through NASM, and I am transferring out of my community college next semester to a state school. I can stay busy and try to forget about what happened, but it has been eating at me.

1o6pdaa,I (28m) want to break up with my gf (37f) mainly due to her son (11m),"Basically, we‚Äôve been together for the past 3 years. She was 3 years after her break up with her son‚Äôs father.
At the very start when we were still just seeing each other, her son was just a shy, harmless kid. We didn‚Äôt talk much as I tried but he barely spoke to anyone but his mum. (It‚Äôs still the case)
A few months in he started to be jealous of me saying things like ‚ÄúHe will take you away from me‚Äù etc. His dad also had a problem with the fact she‚Äôs dating. It ended up with a few court meetings, her getting a restraining order on him, him alienating his son against his mother etc all sorts of things. It‚Äôs alright now. They maintain no contact, and her son sees his father every other weekend. Throughout all of this I did not get involved, never met her son‚Äôs father and l‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt because I‚Äôm not a fan of my gfs exes üòÇ 
The further our relationship went the more aggressive her son started getting, he called me names, absolutely hated me. But he never said it directly to me, it was always things I heard him say to his mother. There was just this one time when he was calling me names, being an absolute brat (still speaking to his mum even though I was there) and I said something along the lines of ‚ÄúWhat did I do to you for you to be so horrible towards me?‚Äù To which he replied ‚ÄúShut up b**ch!‚Äù He was 9 at the time. I know‚Ä¶
So that‚Äôs how it was most of the time.
Then throughout the next 3 years it‚Äôs a battle between them. Him not going to school and her not being able to sustain a job, hitting her (he stopped now, just occasionally), spitting in her face, wishing her death, telling her no one loves her. Recently he told her ‚ÄúAt least my dad has a job unlike you?‚Äù When he knows that he is the reason she doesn‚Äôt have a job.
He gets support form a therapist, she is all over all of the support she can get for him from school and other places, she‚Äôs trying her best and it‚Äôs absolutely heartbreaking seeing how much she hurts because of his behaviour, how much she‚Äôs limited by him.

Now to finish off, and sorry I‚Äôve written so much, I have found myself in a position where I am unable to make myself like the child. No matter how much I tell myself that it‚Äôs just a child and it‚Äôs not his fault. I cannot do it. I absolutely hate him, what he does to his mum, how nothing works to help him with his behaviour. And I hate the position I‚Äôm in. I hated this for over a year. I‚Äôm unhappy, I lost feelings for her. Everything just became one big resentment. Oh and I never want to have children (I very much did want them before this).

My problem is that I can‚Äôt find the strength to break up with her, she relies on my part of the rent, she‚Äôs in a very bad mental state because of the issues with her child, and I fear I‚Äôm gonna make it worse. I have a very good connection with her family. I‚Äôm in the same music band with her brother and his son and dad, sometimes I help out in her other brother‚Äôs company and I don‚Äôt know how they‚Äôre gonna take it.

I had a 2 month situationship with an avoidant it was mostly online but the day she came to meet me in the city we stayed together had a really passionate night but as soon as the morning arrived she said she wasn't ready for any relationship although she said this in the beginning when we started talking but eventually said that she loves me and kept on saying I love you and giving me promises and future planning with me also..i warned her that if she isn't ready she should backoff bcoz i have attachment issues and I'll be ruined by another trauma in my life still she insisted on getting close but used to pull off in between then come back after few hours or days she came here and in one day she discarded me like I was nothing i tired contacting her everytime I messaged her she used to call me and with every call she became colder and colder even abusive and in the last call she said everything was fake and nothing mattered to her she blocked me the moment I showed her the thing she did to me even after i warned her that I wouldn't be able to take any trauma 


I'm completely heartbroken right now she didn't even gave me another chance she just said she wasn't ready for a relationship and left all the 2 months talking meant nothing like did I not even deserve a 2nd chance ..idk what went wrong that night that she decided to ghost me completely she was fine with letting me go she was fine saying that I should look for new partners as I'll get one easily bcoz I'm mature understanding and caring ...

She said in all her last relationships she was clingy begged her bf for acting nice ...that were all the traits of anxious person ....so idk if she was avoidant or not or she just lost interest....never saw her after that ....idk if she'll ever regret doing this to me

1o6p3os,Tell me I‚Äôm not going crazy,"My ex of 7 years dumped me in the beginning of September. I didn‚Äôt see the break up coming and when she dumped me she blamed me for everything. Some days I feel like she was gaslighting me into thinking that but I lot of days I wonder if I ruined this relationship.

We met in 2018 in college and dated for 7 years, the past year and a half she‚Äôs been at grad school out of the country and we‚Äôve been doing long distance. 

This summer I went and visited her at school and then she came home and spent 3 months living with me. When I flew home my inner ear canal got messed up and I had horrible vertigo for roughly 23 days. It was debilitating, felt like I was drunk and had the spins 24/7, I was worried I was going lose my job, I couldn‚Äôt drive, I couldn‚Äôt walk. The second time I went to the hospital they told me I could have a tick born illness, a minor stroke or potentially even a brain tumor but they would run tests to rule it out (it wasn‚Äôt just a really bad case of vertigo).

In this time period I was really scared and definitely depressed and I shut down. I would sit on the couch and watch tv, there were handful of days where I said a couple sentences to my girlfriend, I didn‚Äôt realize how bad I had gotten until one night in bed she said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre here but you‚Äôre not present‚Äù. The next day I signed myself up for therapy (been going for a few months now) started exercising again. I didn‚Äôt realize how poorly I was handling this until It heard from her

We had several long talks about what we both wanted from the relationship and I thought things were good, we were planning on marriage, buying a house and maybe having some kids.

She goes back to school in September and texts me every day ‚Äúi miss you so much please call me after work‚Äù we do long distance so there‚Äôs inappropriate exchanges that I‚Äôll leave out but those continued as well, we talk every day on the phone or FaceTime for an hour or two and then over night the behavior changes.

She stopped saying I love you, stopped calling me, if I called she wouldn‚Äôt respond or pick up and say she‚Äôs tired and we‚Äôd talk tomorrow. 
 
Then she calls me about a week into this very odd behavior and tells me it‚Äôs over, that me being sick for a month ruined the relationship for her and that I‚Äôm emotionally unavailable, I‚Äôm not affectionate, that she needs more, that we‚Äôve been planning our engagement for 2 years and she‚Äôs never actually wanted to marry me, that we should date other people and that she can‚Äôt can‚Äôt just marry her college boyfriend. I‚Äôll add that the day before she left me she cut her hair and dyed it black which is very out of character.

Her friends are all chronically single 27-29 year old women who are constantly being used by men who have poor intentions. I suspect that they‚Äôre very influential in my ex‚Äôs decision making, I also suspect that she cheated on me or had a boyfriend at school that she wouldn‚Äôt tell me about but other days I really wonder if when I was sick this summer if I truly did push her away. 

You would think after 7 years and this being the first really difficult thing we‚Äôve dealt with that you‚Äôd be able to work through it.

Am I crazy for thinking something happened at school that she‚Äôs not telling me about?

I should also add that she wanted to go no contact but that we should talk in a few months which‚Äôs seems fucking crazy to me ",adeptusastartes69,1760469966.0,4,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o6p3os/tell_me_im_not_going_crazy/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o6p3os/tell_me_im_not_going_crazy/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o6ozry,She texted me.,"We broke up 8 days ago. 6 days ago, we called again and she gave me some closure on some things.

She does not plan on getting back together, and she wants space to be alone and work on herself.

Today, she texted me. It was a picture of something alluding to an inside joke we had together. When we first started dating, there was this billboard she would see often around where she lives. She kept telling me she had no idea what it was saying and couldn‚Äôt figure it out. She eventually sent me a picture of it, and it was just a phrase, but the spacing of the letters was so odd that it made it look like a keysmash on a billboard.

Today, she sent me a picture of the same thing and said ‚ÄúLook who I saw today lmao‚Äù

I replied, joking about it, she said nothing. 
This is after ignoring 2 of my texts (both were things she had requested me send to her) 

Why ignore me and delete everything of us just to text me an inside joke for us? Something that we brought up often, and joked about super consistently. 

Just as I‚Äôm finally starting to have moments where I‚Äôm not stuck thinking about her and us and she sends me this. All while ignoring me.

1o6oqly,He left me with all the love in my hands... again,"Hello! I need to vent and maybe get some advice.

A week ago I was with someone I really loved. We had been friends for a year and had been dating for a couple of months. Our relationship had incredible moments, but also difficulties. The first time we broke up, he told me that he ‚Äúmisinterpreted the friendship‚Äù and that she ‚Äúwasn't ready for a relationship.‚Äù He apologized, we tried again, and I trusted and gave it my all...only to have him finish me again.

The last time we spoke, he started by saying:

‚Äî""I'm going to make things clear so that there are no misunderstandings. I'm ending because legally I feel like I can't control my reactions when something disturbs me. It's not because of you, it's not because you've tired me, nor because I'm bored... I simply prefer to finish before hurting you with my explosions.""

During our relationship I always tried to be aware of how I related to him. I asked him if he was comfortable or happy, gave him space and tried to support him. For example, I asked him to reduce the amount of alcohol he drank a little, not to stop completely. When he told me that he couldn't control himself at a party, I told him:

‚Äî‚ÄúDon't worry. I know that takes time.‚Äù

It was never to pressure him, but because I wanted to take care of him. There were also times where I felt like he didn't show interest in certain things and felt pressured; He mentioned that situations like this, although for me they were normal or even grateful, made him explode:

‚Äî‚ÄúWhile with you I realized that something like a complaint or interest was enough to disturb the peace that I used to transmit and made me act that way‚Ä¶ I preferred to end things rather than harm you more with bad reactions.‚Äù

When I asked him why he ended everything via text and didn't talk before, he explained that he couldn't control those reactions and that he would rather end it before he hurt me more. Despite everything, he assured me that he still loved me:

‚Äî‚ÄúI still feel a lot of love, but right now what I want is to be alone again, I don't want someone else to pay for my things.‚Äù

At one point, he also mentioned how he saw the future and the possibility of us becoming interested in other people:

‚Äî""If in the future that happens again, let it be a surprise, and not something that was expected... we pass time and by some coincidence in life, one of those that are so common, you or I become interested in someone else, what happens with the other? Legally, I would not like to go through that.""

Comments also came from his group of friends that affected me, and although he claimed they were out of context, they made me feel disposable. I understand that it wasn't like that, but that I was already tired from before and buying another girl who always made me feel insecure.

Now I feel a huge emptiness. It hurts me to think that someone who loved me can act like all of this doesn't matter, that he can date other people while I'm trying to process everything. I wonder if he used me, if I was too intense, if I failed at something... and at the same time I know I didn't do anything wrong.
At the end of our last conversation, I told him:

‚Äî‚ÄúI love you very much and I hope that your life continues to go well and that you find someone who makes you happy.‚Äù
‚Äî‚ÄúThank you very much, I also wish you that, that you manage to continue improving.‚Äù

And although we said goodbye fondly, I feel that he is already out of my reach and that there is no way for us to return, just as he himself said.

Plus, I was really worried about losing the friendship. He said he was willing, that everything depended on me, but I find myself unable to be friends with someone I really loved.

I just want to find peace, understand how to overcome something like this and learn to let go without feeling like all the love I put in was in vain.",Art04M,1760469149.0,2,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o6oqly/he_left_me_with_all_the_love_in_my_hands_again/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o6oqly/he_left_me_with_all_the_love_in_my_hands_again/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o6oq03,Help..,"Okay so I was in a LDR for almost two years.. We NEVER met so it was basically an online thing. Anyways, I just feel so stupid for caring so much, honestly it is embarrassing when I need to explain the situation I am in.

We were talking every single day and I told him everything. I told him things that I had never told anyone before and I was saving up to go see him, but things weren't so good.

Before we dated, he would tell me how beautiful other girls were, he had friends who were girls and he would tell me that they were his type, sometimes I'd ask his type and he would SEND ME PICTURES of girls off Pinterest and they looked nothing like me, even when I didn't ask, he would send me videos of girls that were his type and it made me so uncomfortable. He said he liked pale or white skin, I am brown, light-skinned, he likes straight hair, my hair is curly and it's dyed. He didn't like peircings, I have 16. And he didn't like braces, I HAVE BRACES.

Basically his type was the opposite of me and of course it made me very insecure, but we ended up getting together after he rejected me a couple of times just because he didn't like the idea of online dating, he got with me because he didn't want to miss his chance, because there were many guys here who were interested in me and still are, and I got along with him, I have a personality! and i matched his humor, i had everything except that look...

And I keep asking myself the question, what did I like him for? I am thinking that it was because he was there to talk to me 24/7, someone who showed genuine interest and care in what was going on in my life and day to day, I think I just miss the feeling of having someone who is ""my person"" because if I think of him, he is not really special, he has always treated me badly and I was hanging onto the good times and those good times are just bare minimum.

I decided to write this after seeing his mom post a picture for his ex's birthday. Her name is similar to his, they knew each other since they were kids, they dated, and then broke up. And then he met me while he was getting over her, I kind of helped him get over her and then I made his life better until we dated.

Everything he told me before we dated about bragging to me how beautiful other guy's girlfriends were made me angry and insecure, I hated the thought of him being around girls because I didn't trust him and I had reason to not trust him. It was a cycle of us treating each other badly so we ended it, but I am still truggling with my emotions. When I became his girlfriend, I felt as if I had the authority to complain about his wrong doings, he would say ""We weren't together"" but when we weren't together he would tell me that we are ""basically dating"" that he loved me and liked me, all while doing that BS.

It made me mad, made me hate and dislike him. Because he wouldn't apologize, he didn't see any wrong in his actions, we weren't together, but he would get mad if I told my friends that I loved them, when I hugged them, when I hung out with them, and I never hung out with guys out of respect for him, all my friends were my girls.

I hate feeling any feeling toward him, he was a genuine asshole and he has yet to apologize for how he treated me before we broke up. I had changed and got therapy and started working on myself, I was ready to try again if that meant that he would change as well, that he would think about his actions, reflect, and learn how to show genuine sympathy. I am not sure what the feeling is.

Is it jealousy? Is it because I feel like I was in the way of him and his ex? I have no idea.

But does anyone have any tips on how to make the feeling fade quicker? I have cut contact with him, I blocked him, deleted the primary app we talked on. He only had one way to reach me, and he chose not to, so I really just want to move on and forget about him.

1o6oepg,Ambiguous Break up with no closure or goodbye,"Hi there, I am new to this reddit channel but I have been reading it a bit leading up to my break up with my partner, I am 28M and he is 24M. Basically we started our relationship out long distance for like 8-9 months. During this period he was very jealous of me, very controlling and very attentive. Looking back on this period of our relationship I would probably say it was a red flag, but as someone with an anxious attachment style, it felt good to be thought of. I never had to worry because he was always showing up. He then moved in with me and we live together for 6 months. This was def a reality check on our relationship and we had a good amount of arguments because he was not working and he was dependent on me. He ended up going to do work in China for what we thought would be 3 months. The second he left he started pulling away, and this really triggered my anxious attachment style. I def was a little pushy and clingy at times but it was because I could feel him choosing his life always over me. We were long distance until like a week ago when we had an argument because we were on a relationship break at the time. He would never take time to talk to me especially when it was having to do with feelings. He end the relationship over text and the last text I have reads ""im not going to suffer because of you"".

1o6o894,Want some insight/opinion in recent breakup,"Hi, I would like to get some insight into what you guys think.
First some insight in the relationship and why/how we broke up. 

My ex (25f) broke up with me (25m) the day before yesterday. To give some context, we were together for 6 months, and we were doing ok. We really love(d) each other and had a good, (in my oppinion) healthy relationship. Yes every once in a while we had an argument, but nothing we couldn‚Äôt work out within 1-2 days (if that). 
About 10 days ago we had a argument in which she expressed that the relationship felt too ‚Äúserious‚Äù for her. Not that she regretted to be in a committed relationship, but rather that the moments we had together weren‚Äôt fun or lighthearted enough. 
A week goes by in which we talked through it, and had some nice moments in that week (and celebrated my birthday with a nice dinner and a night out). I was still a bit hesitant but mostly felt like it was going to be ok (spoiler, it wasn‚Äôt). 
Then the day before yesterday, we spent the whole day at her place (she had to do some things for work so it wasn‚Äôt the most quality time together but still felt nice). 
After dinner we got to talking because she noticed I was still a bit unsure about the situation (because she was too) 
We talked about our views on a/our relationship. 
I‚Äôm of the opinion that a relationship that is purely lighthearted and fun without any difficult moments is a bit utopian. For me the most important thing is that the 2 people in the relationship love each other (which we did and still do) (something along the lines of ‚Äúevery relationship has its ups and downs and bumps in the road, but together you‚Äôll figure it out. 

She‚Äôs (mostly) of the opinion that our relationship was not lighthearted enough and she felt like it was too ‚Äúheavy‚Äù. Even though she loved/loves me she feels that this isn‚Äôt what she needs/wants. 
On the basis of this she ended the relationship, although she wasn‚Äôt sure that it‚Äôs the good decision. 
I‚Äôm saying she ended it, but it feels a bit mutual, given how the conversation went and the ‚Äúflow‚Äù of it. 

All in all it felt like a healthy way to break up. It wasn‚Äôt fun, but it was rather on the basis of idea‚Äôs not alining (?) . During our conversation we both assured each other that we still love one another and made some stupid lighthearted jokes but not in a hurtful way. Afterwards I grabbed (most of) my stuff and drove home (crying üòÖ). When I got home I let her know I was home safe (she asked me to). We also agreed that next week we would plan to exchange the stuff left at the other‚Äôs appartment, but nothing concrete. 

Now for the part I would like to get some insight in what you guys think. 

Yesterday I was really unhappy, and did almost nothing besides going to the climbing gym (didn‚Äôt have to work). Some crying and listening to sad songs was involved. Today I had to work and was still really sad when driving to work; during work I was basically too distracted to really work through/think about the feelings. 
After work I went to run some errands and grab food. During this something shifted/changed. Sure I still felt/feel sad about the relationship being over, but in a less devastating way. 
On one hand I feel like, if we were to meet up to exchange stuff and she asked to give it another go, I might consider it (depending on why she asks this). On the other hand I feel that, if she doesn‚Äôt ask this or I think it‚Äôs not a good reason to try again,  I‚Äôd be good with it. (Again sure I would feel sad, but not be devastated).

Next question; Is it appropriate to send her a message along the lines of ‚Äòhey, I think it‚Äôs sad we ended things, but just want to let you know I don‚Äôt hold anything against you for making the decision you made‚Äô

Also thinking of letting her know (when we excange stuff) that if she ever wants to be friends, I might be open to that, and that if she wants someone to climb with she could ask me.
I think that we could really be good friends/ climbing buddies given that we have enough time to get over one another. (This is honestly not an attempt to be clingy, but might be perceived as such)

Could you guys give me your thougth/opinions? I‚Äôm kind of new to breakups (the other one I had was a whole different story üòÖ)
I feel like the time frame doesn‚Äôt match up to where I am mentally (or think I am?), but also feel quite comfortable in my mindset. Sure there‚Äôll be moments that I‚Äôll find it more difficult, but like I said it feels really fast to be in this mindset.",Jipke5614,1760468014.0,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o6o894/want_some_insightopinion_in_recent_breakup/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o6o894/want_some_insightopinion_in_recent_breakup/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o6o824,What‚Äôs been helping me survive (in case it helps someone else too),"I‚Äôm not sure if this will help anyone‚Äôs specific situation, but my boyfriend broke up with me a 2 weeks ago.

Let me start by saying I‚Äôve never handled breakups well. The only way I know how to explain it is that without a partner, my life feels grey. It‚Äôs like it loses all color and my entire world falls apart. When I‚Äôm with someone, I feel content and motivated. Losing them feels like the most consuming, painful thing.

I realized a while ago that this reaction is deeper than just heartbreak or missing someone. It‚Äôs something in me. So this time, I decided something had to change, because honestly, I wasn‚Äôt sure I could survive another breakup like this.

Here are a few things that have actually helped me this time around:

1.	When I miss him, I acknowledge it but I don‚Äôt let the thought spiral. My life does have meaning, and when darker thoughts start creeping in, I stop them immediately. I‚Äôve literally held my breath, splashed water on my face, jumped up and down, yelled ‚ÄúNO‚Äù ‚Äî anything to interrupt the spiral before it starts.
	
2.	I didn‚Äôt listen to breakup podcasts or write him a goodbye letter. Instead, I wrote a letter to myself. I focused on the parts of me that need care and growth outside of that relationship.
	
3.	Grounding techniques, but with a twist. Instead of talking to myself, I talk to my nervous system like it‚Äôs someone I love. It might sound strange, but it helps. I struggle with loving myself, but I‚Äôm good at loving others, so seeing my nervous system as something separate gives me compassion for it.
	
4.	I reframed my sadness. When I feel that ache, instead of thinking ‚ÄúI miss him,‚Äù I tell myself, ‚ÄúOf course I‚Äôm sad‚Ä¶my body is literally withdrawing from oxytocin and dopamine.‚Äù It‚Äôs not because he‚Äôs the only cure; it‚Äôs because my brain is healing.
	
5.	I started aggressively loving my life, even the smallest things. To be honest, I don‚Äôt love my life right now. But I‚Äôve started romanticizing the smallest moments like the sun hitting my face. I used to roll my eyes when people said that, but when you‚Äôre at rock bottom, the little things should feel good.

I hope I explained this clearly and that it makes some kind of sense. If it helps even one person, I‚Äôm glad I shared it. The biggest thing for me has been number one and stopping the spirals before they take over.

1o6o42l,Breakups and moving on,"Two weeks ago, I broke up with my ex of half a year.  We spoke the next day and I asked if she was open to talking about our relationship and seeing if we could talk about our differences and see what the future has in store for us. Then I put the ball in her court to reach out when she was ready to talk. And yes, I had to put her in control because she always said I was controlling so...

Two weeks go by, I've been moving on and assumed she was moving on as well as she hasn't said anything. I at least expected a ""Hey, I'm still thinking"" or ""I'm not open to talking anymore."" type of message, but it was just silence.

I started a new dating app profile. I felt ready to start again. My false hope of her reaching out again was gone. But then, an hour later, she deleted me everywhere. I'm guessing she either saw the dating app profile or was done too. I just find it a big coincidence that she moved on, on the same day. But when I created my dating app profiles, I froze them so no one could see me or match with me. I felt guilty for creating them and was debating sending an, I'm done, text. I'm guessing, if she did see the profile, she was expecting me to reach out soon and cut me off instead.

There are a lot more variables into our crumbling relationship and that it has felt like it was crumbling for a month or so before I broke it off. She wasn't caught off guard either. I broke it off after she ""ghosted"" for three days and asking her, how are you was apparently upsetting her because i was controlling her.",CommonEmu5091,1760467747.0,4,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o6o42l/breakups_and_moving_on/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o6o42l/breakups_and_moving_on/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False

1o6o26o,We broke up because he is moving away,"I (26f) met this guys (25m) 4 months ago. From the start I knew he is planning on leaving the country in a few months, yet we still entered a relationship/situationship. We fell in love despite knowing he is leaving.

He is an amazing human being, caring, loving, gentle and treated me like an absolute princess. I have never connected with someone this deeply and we just understand each other very well as we are very similar. For the first time I felt truly understood and he taught me so much and has given me a lot of guidance. We broke up a few times because we know that we have to stop this before we get even more attached, yet every time we found a way back to each other.

Yesterday, we decided to break up for good, because the emotional torment is too big. As much as we love each other, we are both unhappy because we know that all this is temporary as he is leaving eventually. Long distance is not a possibility as he will be indefinitely moving a to country that is very far away.

I love him so much and i‚Äôm broken.

1o6o0mt,Any insight?,"Hey all I just need some insight on a recent situation! 

I have been going out with a guy for a short bit and we really hit things off and have really good conversations/ connection.

We spent the weekend together and had a really fun day. A few things came up that I could tell up front were awkward but we quickly redirected the conversation and continued to have a nice time.

On Sunday I noticed he didn‚Äôt text me at all so I just let him be. Monday morning I asked him if he was ok and if anything was wrong and he sent me this.

‚ÄúHey *** I‚Äôm sorry gosh it‚Äôs just the avoidant in me that doesn‚Äôt know how to express my feelings and really I don‚Äôt know what to say or how to explain how I‚Äôm feeling :/ I think I was just put off a little when we hung out about a couple of things and don‚Äôt know how to process that

I think I just needed a little break or some time to think how I‚Äôm feeling! I‚Äôm sorry I don‚Äôt really know what to say right now I may just need a little more time :/‚Äú


I acknowledged his message and apologized and immediately went NC with him.

I‚Äôm not planning on waiting around for him/hoping he comes back but I did really enjoy going out with him,(he‚Äôs a really sweet guy!) for the most part he seemed really into me up until that message.


Is this just a nice way of ending things silently? Or is he actually processing things and will probably reach out? 

For context we had really deep conversations about attachment styles/mental health and he has already opened up about how he can really struggle with his feelings.

I respected his wishes and have left him alone so he can have the space he needs.

What do you guys think? Wait a little longer or just cut my losses? ",Wide_Carob934,1760467527.0,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o6o0mt/any_insight/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o6o0mt/any_insight/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o6nsaf,Is this selfish love?,"Question . My ex and I broke up a year ago and konda keep on no contact. Every now and then she called me until March then silence cince then until last month I called her. She is with someone else. It hurt like he'll. She did said she was gonna be alone for a long time and work in herself and now she is in a relationship.  I do hope and wish the best for her. 

I do want someone to love her the way she needs to be loved and feel true love appreciated.  I was not the best partner when we were together. She did hope to get back together months after the breakup but she did told me she hook up with another guy and started seeing him and didn't work out. And I was hurting so much I pushed her away she did asked to be friends because she hoped we got back together. 

My real question. Is it selfish I want her. It just pains me so much she is choosing to be with someone else while I'm here with so much love and I have learned so much of my self and looked back and way to show her love and treat her the way she wants and needs to be treated. But it hurts to know im crying in bed while she is in someone else bed. And I think of them kissing and being intimate. It breaks me. But I want the best for her. I do wanna be happy with her. Is it selfish. Even if know I can't move on cause this one broke me completely.  

She has her peace and wants me to leave her alone. She did said if destiny brings us back together. I dont think that would ever happend . But id she comes back how can i take ber back. I know i cant be with anyone else for years at least 3 more years minimun. Cause I do feel i gonna pucke and i had throw up before because if the idea of her wirhsomeone else or me being with anyone else. 



I know I fucked up. I know she is gone and I know she is a total different person. I have change and knowledge my faults and mistakes and I wanna be a hearly person. But even if she calls me back cause she has me bloked and she reach out to me. How can I let that go? That she chose someone else. I will feel like a choise and I will have that in my memory that I will compare to the other person. As well as not only the hurt but the story we have. She sleeps around while I stay single alone working in myself.

1o6nruk,I hate myself.,"After the mental torture of the first time round, he came back promising to make it right, only for him to escalate the abuse. I knew better, but I was running off disassociation and a desperation for peace. I loved him, and for some reason truly believed he wanted to and was willing to fix whatever it was that made him a monster. He was a self admitted abuser, with a million reasons to justify it. Those around him enable him and blame me for the way he treated me. I tried everything in my power to hold him accountable, but it turned into him holding me responsible for helping him stop treating me this way. It lead almost daily to hours long arguments where he would weaponise abandonment, and verbally abuse me to a point where I was left hyperventilating, apologising and I guess trying to remind him how beautiful the man I saw behind the abuse was. 
Last week, I noticed that something he told me didn‚Äôt quite add up. I was super cautious in asking him about it, but he still got really angry. After a while of the same cycle, he admitted to having lied (the situation leads me to believe he was cheating but he didn‚Äôt admit this). It lead to what had become a habit of him blocking me on everything after saying some really cruel things, except this time it stuck. 
Last weekend I met a girl who I briefly spoke to about this. She asked to see a photo of him, and after describing him and his family exactly to check it was the right person, she told me I‚Äôm not the only person he‚Äôs done these things to. She described how he was with her friend a while back, and how he had mentally abused her. Then she told me it escalated to SA.
I feel sick, angry, horrified that I fell for this man. But I think the most overwhelming feeling right now is that I hate myself. For the power he might still have over me, the fact I still feel responsible. The fact that for some stupid reason it still matters that I meant something to him. It all makes me feel almost complicit.",Available_Access8279,1760466949.0,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o6nruk/i_hate_myself/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o6nruk/i_hate_myself/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o6nq4s,Should I send my ex a present,"Throwaway because I worry they may find this. 

Some background:

My ex and I started dating in high school, and we are both now in college. I got broken up with several months ago, they said we could stay friends. We broke up after a big argument, and I was fighting for them to give me a chance. We had said we would talk about possibly getting back together at some point and I had even heard from mutual friends that they talked about how ""we might get back together"" This obviously made me hopeful for reconciliation but life is never that simple. 

We last spoke about 2 months ago, and the last month or so of our communication was sparse. The conversation about getting back together never happened, and they have moved halfway across the country to transfer schools (this was planned for a long time and something we both seemed willing to work through). I still messaged them here and there but stopped after a week went by without me getting responses. Then, before they left for school I sent them a text wishing them well and saying don't be a stranger etc. etc. And they read it but didn't respond. I'm trying to be respectful of their space, but the fact that so much is unresolved is killing me, and from how things ended I really think we have a shot at making things work.

I will also add that I noticed that they restricted me on both of their Instagram accounts for a while, but have since unrestricted me all during the period of us not talking at all. I am barred from viewing their stories however.

I have an idea that I'm mulling over that I think is a good idea but I'm not fully sure of. 
When we were dating, we went to a concert together for an artist that I liked and was debatably my ex's favorite. This artist releases solo music now, but was in a band. The show we went to was marketed as another solo show but was actually a surprise reunion show. It was very exciting for us and a good time all around. Since the band is back together, this kind of show is being made into an annual celebration by the artist, even being described as a year 2 to the show we went to. 

I have bought a ticket for myself to this show as I intended on going regardless of my ex's attendance. My thought is to buy concert merch, the show we went to last year had a special shirt for the specific show we went to, and it seems there will be another shirt for the second event. 

I want to buy my ex a shirt from this show when I go, because I know they like the artist a little more than I do and will be unable to go due to their current distance with school. During the winter holidays, they will be staying with their parents who live in the same area I do. I want to send them a shirt with a note around Christmas, since they won't be able to make it. In good faith I believe that this would be something that they would appreciate/like to have, but I don't want to be creepy by mailing things to their house. That said, being the kind of person they are, a ""shot in the dark"" letter/gift like that could go over well. 

I obviously want to start a new dialogue with them, and I think this could be a way for me to do it. I will also say that when we broke up we said we wouldn't talk to other people until we had the conversation about reconciliation. The conversation obviously didn't happen as planned, but I haven't talked to anyone, and I've heard through the grapevine that they are also not talking to anyone. It might be wishful thinking, but I know that they aren't the kind of person to easily romantically open up to a new person. From their instagram activity, I at least know that I am in their thoughts, and that they decided that restricting me was too harsh.

TLDR; I'm a hopeless romantic not over my ex, we were meant to talk about reconciliation and did not, I want to send them a gift that will have personal significance to reopen a dialogue between us

1o6noq8,He broke up because he thinks I‚Äôm unavailable,"I (27F) started going out with this guy (29M) around January/February this year. At the time, I was in a really messy situation: I was still in contact with my ex. I didn‚Äôt have any feelings for him, but he kept asking for my help, and it was hard to say no because our past relationship was very codependent. This guy had also recently ended a 7-year relationship, just a few months before we met. He still had some contact with his ex, but it was minimal ‚Äî small, casual stuff that didn‚Äôt bother me. What did bother him, though, was my ongoing contact with my ex, which, to be fair, was more ‚Äúintense.‚Äù Eventually, I cut contact with my ex, blocked him everywhere in order to reassure this guy I had no feelings for my ex!

Me and this guy were seeing each other almost every week, but he often complained that it wasn‚Äôt enough for him. The thing is, I worked 300 km away from home, so I only had weekends free ‚Äî and I wanted to spend that time with friends and family too, not just him. For a while, that seemed okay, but I started to feel like he was pushing for more and more time together.

Every time we had a small argument, he‚Äôd immediately want to meet in person the next day, even if it meant driving 120+ km. I always thought that was unnecessary ‚Äî I could wait a day or two, and there was no need for such a big trip.

Eventually, I started feeling pressured. Last week, I had a really rough day at work ‚Äî I had just resigned and had some hard conversations with my leadership team. I wasn‚Äôt online all day and couldn‚Äôt text him. I left work around 7 p.m. and immediately sent him a message asking if I could call. He didn‚Äôt see it until a few hours later, and by then I was already overwhelmed and having a meltdown. I told him I didn‚Äôt want to talk that night because I wasn‚Äôt feeling well. He kept pushing to talk, and I repeated that I didn‚Äôt want to. He got mad, and a few days later he broke up with me, saying that relationships are supposed to be shared and that I should share my insecurities with him. From my perspective, I just needed time to process everything ‚Äî I wanted to share, just not at that moment. The next day, I was actually ready to talk.

Now I‚Äôm wondering if I have some kind of avoidance problem, since I actually have a hard time opening up. I genuinely don‚Äôt like people telling me how to handle my emotions. I like to process things on my own first. He made me feel like I was wrong for wanting space and time. He constantly demanded more closeness and openness, even when I wasn‚Äôt ready.

I‚Äôm trying to understand how to better navigate this kind of situation. How can someone who needs space and time to process emotions communicate that effectively to a partner who values constant openness and contact? Are there healthy ways to meet in the middle?

TL;DR: Started dating a guy who wanted constant contact and closeness. I needed more space to process emotions and balance my time (especially since I worked far away). He broke up with me after I didn‚Äôt want to talk one night when I was overwhelmed. Not sure if I‚Äôm being avoidant or if he was being too demanding.",Pretty_when_i_cry7,1760466754.0,1,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o6noq8/he_broke_up_because_he_thinks_im_unavailable/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o6noq8/he_broke_up_because_he_thinks_im_unavailable/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o6nkhn,Should I send him this letter? 10 years of love that keeps coming back but never lasts,"
Hi everyone,
I‚Äôve been reading here for a while, but today I finally felt the need to write.
My story with him started when we were both 18.
It‚Äôs been 10 years now, a mix of real love, deep connection, and endless goodbyes.

It wasn‚Äôt one-sided.
He‚Äôs come back to me again and again over the years, every time saying he missed me, that I was the one who made him feel safe but alive.
But every time things got too real, he‚Äôd pull away again.
He‚Äôs what people would call avoidant. He runs when love stops being light and starts being deep.

The truth is, I never stopped loving him.
Even when he disappeared for months, I‚Äôd still find myself hoping.
And when he came back, it always felt like no time had passed, like our hearts still recognized each other.

But the pattern never changed.
He loves me, but he‚Äôs afraid of me, or rather, of the part of himself he becomes when he‚Äôs with me.
He once told me that being with me made him feel ‚Äútoo much,‚Äù like I saw through him completely.
And maybe that‚Äôs why he couldn‚Äôt stay.

After all these years, I‚Äôve accepted that I can‚Äôt change him.
I‚Äôve tried patience, silence, kindness, nothing ever made him feel safe enough to stay.
And now, after his last message saying it‚Äôs definitely over, I still can‚Äôt tell if this is truly the end or just another pause in our cycle.

So I wrote him a letter.
Not to chase him, not to fix anything, but because after ten years, silence hurts more than honesty.

The Letter

I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôll ever read these words,
and honestly, it doesn‚Äôt even matter anymore.
I‚Äôm not writing this for you to understand, or to come back.
I‚Äôm writing because there comes a point where silence becomes heavier than pain itself.

You said it was over.
Definitively.
And for the first time, I didn‚Äôt try to change your mind.
Because I know what you call ‚Äúover‚Äù isn‚Äôt the absence of love,
it‚Äôs your escape.
You never knew how to stay where you were truly seen.
You never knew how to handle deep, steady, sincere love.

I loved you in your light, and forgave your shadows.
I loved you when you were present,
and even more when you disappeared.
I looked for you in my silences, in my prayers,
in every choice I made.
And you know what?
I loved you in the purest way possible, without owning you.
But you never knew how to love without running away.

I don‚Äôt blame you.
You are who you are,
a man who confuses freedom with distance,
desire with fear, love with control.
You wanted to experience everything except depth.
And I wanted to feel everything, even if it burned me.
That‚Äôs the difference between us.
I had the courage to love until I lost myself,
you preferred to leave before finding yourself.

Before, I doubted myself.
I thought maybe I wasn‚Äôt enough.
Maybe you wanted to travel, to live, to meet other women.
Maybe you were searching for something I didn‚Äôt have.
But now I know.
There was nothing to find elsewhere.
Because what I gave you,
you‚Äôll never find again.
And I say that without arrogance, just clarity.

I don‚Äôt blame you for not choosing me.
Because truthfully, you couldn‚Äôt choose someone
you weren‚Äôt even capable of facing.
It wasn‚Äôt me you ran from,
it was everything you felt when you were next to me.

I‚Äôve loved you since I was 18.
Do you really think I don‚Äôt see every side of you?
Do you really think I haven‚Äôt understood your silences, your fears, your contradictions?
I grew up with you, in your shadow, in your absences.
I know your wounds, your fears, your patterns.
And it‚Äôs exactly because I know you so deeply
that I can‚Äôt bring myself to hate you.

You said you gave me everything, that you have nothing left to give.
But if you really think about it,
what did you actually give me?
Everything a man gives to the woman he truly loves,
I never received from you.
Not a real gesture, not proof, not even a place in your world.

Ten years, ten years of emptiness.
Ten years where I was always waiting,
and you were always leaving.
Ten years where you said you loved me,
but never built anything beside me.

And yet, you knew.
You knew that if you had taken one real step toward us,
just one,
everything would have fallen into place.
Everything would‚Äôve been peaceful.
But peace scares you.
Because loving without chaos
forces you to face the truth,
your own fear of closeness, your own need to run.

Look at this last year alone.
Twelve months.
You were with me for maybe three,
and the rest you spent running,
from me, from yourself, from what we could‚Äôve been.
And still, I waited.
I listened.
I supported you.
I was there when no one else was.
I loved you unconditionally,
and never asked for anything,
not a gift, not a dinner, not an effort.
All I ever wanted was you.

But you took everything for granted.
You had me without seeing me.
You loved me without ever choosing me.
You say you‚Äôre empty now,
but that‚Äôs because you never knew how to give fully.
You loved halfway, afraid love would consume you.
But that‚Äôs what love is,
burning, a little.
And I burned for both of us.

So think about it.
Not about what you tell yourself,
but about the truth you keep avoiding.
You didn‚Äôt lose a ‚Äúnice‚Äù woman.
You lost the one who would‚Äôve waited for you forever,
if only you had respected her.

You can keep running,
keep chasing new faces, new noise,
but one day, your escape will catch up with you.
And when it does,
it will bring you back here,
to what you ran from,
a love that was real, deep, steady, rare.

I‚Äôm not closing the door.
I‚Äôm living, rebuilding,
but my heart isn‚Äôt closed.
It‚Äôs just wiser now, calmer, more grounded.
I‚Äôm not waiting for you, but I know.
I know you‚Äôll think of me in your silences.
I know you‚Äôll understand, late, maybe too late,
that it was me you truly loved.

And when that day comes,
I don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôll be.
But I hope you‚Äôll finally have learned to love
without running.
Because when you do,
you‚Äôll realize it wasn‚Äôt me you lost,
it was your peace.

‚∏ª

I honestly don‚Äôt know what to do.
Should I send him this letter or keep it to myself?
Part of me feels like I‚Äôll regret it if I don‚Äôt,
but another part is scared it‚Äôll only push him away again.

Please be honest with me.
Do you think a letter like this can actually make a difference?
And please, don‚Äôt tell me to ‚Äúmove on.‚Äù
If it were that simple, I wouldn‚Äôt be here.

1o6nhme,I'm upset about our breakup,"I wasn't before, but now I am. She broke up with me a few weeks ago and I was so heartbroken over it. She wasn't happy and if I wanted to be with her, I needed to show change. In the meantime, she wants said she wants to explore. Of course I wanted to be with her so I wanted to change, but given more time and reflection, I have realized that I should not even be doing this. She asked to stay friends, keep each other updated on what we are doing and whatnot, and while I have been doing that, it has been nothing but silence from her. Friends can have conversations, but apparently she are incapable of that too. I only recently realized that I shouldn't be putting in the effort if she isn't either, despite her being the one who wanted to stay friends. And now that I have thought about it more, I think she has been checked out of our relationship because it all came so suddenly and there was no communication beforehand. I think she was just looking for the first available chance to end it and now she is able to do what she wants, like explore. While I want her, I feel so dumb for even trying so hard when nothing I do is reciprocated. I am also upset she is getting over it so damn easy compared to me. It was so hard for me to take down the reminders of us in my room, deleting our photos and posts, but for her it was like nothing. She expressed that maybe in the future we can try again, but I just feel like I am a backup plan in case her exploring doesn't go the way she wants. I just dont get why she had to give me this hope by keeping the door open and thinking we could get back together and in the mean time be friends. I wish instead of trying to soften the blow, she was just honest and straight up, and just broke it clean off because before I was upset, I would overthink every little thing.",Amazing_Ad_2143,1760466308.0,5,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o6nhme/im_upset_about_our_breakup/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o6nhme/im_upset_about_our_breakup/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o6nhah,What could i have done differently?,"For Context of the situation.


There was a chick who started to take a liking to me on the job where i work at. We make jokes with each other and enjoy one another company while we worked together. While we are leaving work heading to the parking lot, she briefly mentioned she was seeing someone but it ‚Äúcomplicated‚Äù‚Ä¶ Which turns out he Boyfriend is in jail for (‚ò†Ô∏èüî´) for the 18years. So i told her basically to end things with him if she really want to pursue a relationship with Me. Some time had pass and she ending thing with the jail boyfriend ‚Ä¶..Well atleast so she claimed.  

(But I didn‚Äôt know at the time she never broke up with him.)

So we began to date each other about 5 or 6 months in the relationship. I noticed strange patterns. She never wanna hang out on certain days or hang up the phone-call to answer someone else. But when i ask who is it?ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

She would say its nobody or it just family member calling her at 11-12pm at night while we FaceTime and talk.

So i began to close eye on her,I know carnival season is approaching fast and i decided it would be nice to spend quality time together. Before i got chance to ask her to go out and enjoy ourselves, She mentioned she was going to go with her female friends.
She even FaceTime me to pick out her outfit!! So while on the call i said ‚ÄúHey maybe i should tag along if i finished work early tonight!‚Äù 
She paused briefly like she calculating something and Then she turn and said ok sure but i can sense that it was genuine.. About 20 minutes later she texted me saying she can‚Äôt go out because she has to babysit her niece and nephew so she‚Äôs staying with the kids and plans are canceled.

I ended up leaving work early and got dress to go spy on my ex/gf . So me and friends are at the carnival looking for my girl but we don‚Äôt see her. My friend finally passed by a bar and saw her sitting there drinking in a crowd mix with guys and girls. Which i didnt know was her jail boyfriend family she was with her hanging out. 
My friend sneak pass and ended up seeing a photo of her phone screensaver which was her and Jail Boyfriend hugging on the lock screen. 
He reported back to me like a real oneü´°üíØ.

1o6ngjy,"It‚Äôs been 7 months, and I still can‚Äôt move on","I‚Äôm 21M. My ex (21F) and I dated for 3.5 years ‚Äî she was my high school sweetheart.We started dating senior year and did long distance during our first year of college. I went to a local school near her because I wanted to stay close, but things started to feel off, and I eventually transferred to a school farther away. We broke up for a month, then got back together.
For the next 1.5 years, we were inseparable. We were each other‚Äôs firsts, best friends, and spent almost every day talking or calling. But during our last year together, I got overwhelmed with school and started to pull away emotionally. Long distance became hard. I never stopped loving her, but I didn‚Äôt realize how much she was hurting because she didn‚Äôt tell me.
She visited me for my birthday, gave me a bracelet with our initials, kissed me, and told me to visit soon because she missed me. A week later, right before I was about to book my flight, she told me she couldn‚Äôt do it anymore. She said she didn‚Äôt feel loved and that I had neglected her. There were also issues with my family not fully accepting her, which made things even harder. She told me she‚Äôd been crying every night and couldn‚Äôt sleep. I was shocked ‚Äî I didn‚Äôt realize how bad it had gotten.
I begged her to stay, but she made up her mind. I cried every day for three weeks. Then I started working over the summer, which helped distract me. A few months passed, and I had some flings, but I was still hurting deeply.
Then I heard something I wish I hadn‚Äôt ‚Äî apparently, during the month we were broken up, she kissed one of her guy friends. I‚Äôd known about that and told her I was uncomfortable with them hanging out one-on-one afterward. But I recently found out (through her friend) that she kissed him again on spring break and that they spent the night together ‚Äî about a week and a half before we officially broke up. I never heard this from her directly, so now I don‚Äôt even know what to believe.
She‚Äôs seeing someone new now, and it seems serious. Meanwhile, I‚Äôm still stuck. I haven‚Äôt met anyone else. I keep comparing every girl I talk to with her. It‚Äôs been 7 months, and I thought I‚Äôd feel better by now, but I don‚Äôt. She‚Äôs moving on, and I‚Äôm still here ‚Äî missing her, angry, confused, and broken.
It‚Äôs affecting my studies, my focus, my motivation. My days used to be filled with calling her, and now there‚Äôs just silence. I‚Äôve tried working on myself, spending time with friends, and staying busy, but no matter what I do, thoughts of her are always in the background ‚Äî like a song that won‚Äôt stop playing.
I just want peace. I want this noise in my head to stop. I want to feel like myself again. Any and all advice is appreciated. Thanks.

1o6ngco,Breakup After 9 Years (Cheating). Advice Needed Please,"Hey everyone. I posted a few days ago on a few subreddits about my recent breakup with my ex of 9 years (25F discarded/dumped by 25F, both bisexual).

BACKSTORY Long story short, out of the blue my ex told me she was feeling attraction towards a coworker, someone she had openly talked about with me for weeks prior to this and someone I also met. She framed it as a sexuality/identity confusion triggered by this guy and that nothing physical had happened or would happen. There was definitely emotional cheating considering they had planned a weekend stay at my ex's apartment while she was still dating me. Never asked if I was okay with it but I foolishly did not suspect anything. She refused to call off him coming to stay at her apartment ""to work on a project together"". I showed nothing but love and understanding when she told me all of this, even though my heart was being broken and even though clarity was being stripped from me (I kept asking if it was a breakup, to which she refused to answer but kept talking about our relationship in the past tense). Next day, over text, she began breaking up with me but again, refused to answer my question if this was a breakup so of course I had to be the one to say it. Next day, she went out shopping with a mutual friend and texted me that she needed space and that I was the one who called it a breakup, not her. I made the mistake of begging and pleading, making dramatic offers, open relationship, etc. Long story short, we had talked about me going to her work event a couple weeks prior. I texted her asking if she still wanted me to go. No reply. I went anyways just in case it was the last time I would get to support her. She looked like she saw a ghost when she saw me. Didn't introduce me to anyone as I just stood there looking like a fool. Her friends did not say hello to me. She told her friends we were on a break without even coming to me first. We ended up having a conversation, me begging/pleading and crying again while she told me she was going through a sexuality/identity confusion and wanted out of the relationship. Asked me not to be mad at the guy, that he did nothing wrong, but that he broke up with his partner, too (All I needed to know). She refused an open relationship, told me it's possible that she could catch feelings for him when he comes to stay at her apartment. She compared us to a married couple but that she did not want to string me along. She hugged me and I went home. The next day she sent a bunch of reassuring text messages telling me she would not ghost me, would not go no contact, I'm still her best friend, she cares about me, that we shouldn't use labels, that she needs time, she won't run off into a relationship with him, etc. She became distant the next couple of days, barely texting, and expressed feeling mentally unwell. I offered to come see her/help. The day came where he came to stay at her apartment, and she immediately turned off location and never responded to me. The day he left, she removed all photos of me and us together off of her social media. Our mutual friend began posting pictures of her smiling and having fun, and my ex also made a post, including with this new boy. Mutual friend never reached out to me asking how I was.

4 months later and I never heard from her and we have not spoken since June. Couple days ago she deleted the playlist she made for me when we were younger. I ended up gathering the strength to block her on all social media last month after she began posting selfies and unfollowing my best friend. She continued to follow me.

The main part of this post is.....I still have belongings at her apartment, including a $600 console that I kept at her house for us to play together. She never returned it or made an effort to ask if I wanted it back. Maybe it is my responsibility but I am pissed that she did not have the basic decency to return it to me automatically, which I would have done for her. She doesn't even have to speak to me to send it back in the mail. I do NOT want to speak to her given I have so many things I would like to say to her but refuse to give her my time. I hate that I have to part ways with my belongings but I just do not want to speak to her and I feel like a coward. I also gave her hundreds of dollars recently out of the goodness of my heart for her project with this guy.

I am so broken and still hurting. I am in therapy but I am really trying. It feels like something always brings me back to square one and I have a lot of guilt, self-blame and self-hatred I do not know where to put. I have no way of knowing the extent of the cheating or if they are together now. She tried telling me it wasn't the same since I am a girl and he's a guy. She completely downplayed it, in my mind,

Now when I do that though I‚Äôm the bad guy for not trying to fix things?

I‚Äôm just looking for some advice and support as I navigate this extremely difficult chapter of my life. My partner and I were together for 6.5 years. We broke up for a month during the 2020 pandemic but she contacted me at the end of the month to try again. 

Since then, we have been together through life changes, up‚Äôs & downs, milestones, etc. I‚Äôm not here to diagnose anyone but she has an avoidant attachment style with diagnosed OCD and ADHD. The past 1.5 years have been rough but we agreed to work through our issues in couples therapy. After only a month of attending sessions she told me she no longer is in love with me, doesn‚Äôt yearn for me, something has always been missing, etc.

1o6n46l,"She broke up with me, and now I have to watch her at the job she got with my help","Hello, Reddit!

I would very much like to hear your thoughts, because mine are broken, thrown into the washing machine, and put on spin cycle.

I know that I am not the only one ‚Äúgoing through changes‚Äù at the moment; there are many of us, and maybe someone will find my story interesting. But I'm definitely interested in your thoughts on this warm and very silly story.

It was as if fate was pushing us towards each other, we fell into darkness and my girlfriend gave up just before dawn. 

We started dating a little less than two years ago. 

It was her first relationship, she was 24 at the time, I was a couple of years older.

We started in Kyiv. We are both from Ukraine, but at the time we started dating, I was living in Kyiv and working as a lawyer. She graduated from university in Vienna and was looking for a job there, but came to visit her mother in Kyiv for the New Year holidays. It was a fairy tale. We got off to a great start and found each other almost immediately (although I had been looking for the right person for a very long time, and her six previous years on Tinder had been completely unsuccessful). I guess what helped was that I overlooked her physical flaws (she's not ugly, but people don't find her attractive, and for me, attractiveness isn't the most important thing) and saw her very kind and naive soul. It was difficult to part ways after a few weeks in Kyiv, but we were confident that we would definitely wait for each other. The relationship continued online and was wonderful. 

A few months later, something changed, and I was forced to leave Ukraine. 

For a man over 18, this means either huge money or huge risk. I left completely legally, without paying or breaking the law. I was very lucky (actually, I don't want to call it luck, because it only happened because of my mother's illness, but she herself calls it luck ‚Äî leaving, not the illness, so forgive me!). Just imagine how we felt then. I called my girlfriend right after crossing the border, and she was in tears, she couldn't be happier.

It was as if fate had smiled on us.

We started living in Vienna. Our life unfolded in a 20-square-meter dorm room. Do you know what's surprising and paradoxical? We, people who had never lived as a couple before, spent a wonderful and magical year in that room. It was obviously designed for one person, there was little space, and we couldn't be alone. And yes, sometimes we had domestic arguments, like everyone else. But overall, it was wonderful, which we both agreed on and never questioned.

But after a year, we ran out of money. We were in a transitional period, as I had not yet been promoted, and my girlfriend still could not find a job (yes, for over a year). We had to move apart for a while. We agreed that as soon as she found a job, we would move back in together, and since she would be looking for a job remotely in Kyiv, the process would go much faster. I went to live with a friend for the time being, hoping that the separation would not last more than a month.

But she had no luck with the job search. Until she was offered a job at my company. It's important to note that dating is not allowed in our company. But since I have a good relationship with the management, and they sincerely wanted to help our couple, they hired her. 

Several more months passed. On the one hand, we were ready to move in together, but finding an apartment in Vienna is a terrible hassle. We spent months doing this. 

During our time apart, I fell into a slight depression, became a little irritable, and sometimes pressured my girlfriend about finding an apartment, as it seemed to me that she wasn't putting enough effort into such an important matter (she's a bit passive by nature, and it was stupid of me to pressure her, but alas). Don't get me wrong, I didn't insult her, swear at her, or call her names. I just tried to convey the importance of finding an apartment in a raised voice. This was partly because I understand perfectly well the impact of distance on relationships.

At the end of August, she came to visit me for a couple of weeks. The trip was frankly not very good. We always had a period of adjustment for a couple of days or a week after being apart (even a week or two). We would argue over little things, but it would settle down in a couple of days.

Here, probably because of the long time apart and different biorhythms by that time, we argued more than usual. But in principle, it all ended on a good note. The trip was originally planned for a week, but ended up lasting two‚Äîit was her idea. She left in tears because she was leaving. And when she arrived in Kyiv in early September, she told her friend and her mother that she would now be very actively looking for an apartment and wanted to move in as soon as possible.

And, miraculously, we found a good apartment option. It was a very encouraging call. During the negotiations, my girlfriend delayed an issue that was her responsibility for several days, which almost caused the negotiations to fall through. 

I got upset about it and had a fight with my girlfriend. It was very difficult for me to be apart for a month and see this passivity (which, unfortunately, was a character trait of hers). But literally an hour later, I called her and presented a solution to the problem.

A few days later, she said that our relationship was full of conflict. She has a lot of stress in her life, including work and her relationship with her mother. And when I put pressure on her, all the negativity in her life is reflected in her attitude towards me. She looked confused and said she didn't know what it was and that maybe it was just a phase.

We spent a few cold days apart, and on September 13, she told me she was thinking of breaking up. We talked on the phone and within an hour agreed that it was just a phase, that we needed to pull ourselves together and be strong. We agreed to devote more time and attention to each other, to take care of each other, and to get through this period together.

The next week was hell. She sent me several messages a day. And in the evening, she called me and said everything was fine, not to worry. It was a week of terrible stress, insomnia, and depression. I calmed down after the call, but then immediately ran into her avoidance. It's important to note that I didn't write a billion messages and tried to hold on, even though I said that it was all affecting me.

By the end of the week, we agreed to discuss everything on the 20th. I ordered flowers because I sincerely believed her words that everything was fine, and I was eagerly awaiting that call to calm down.

How wrong I was.

On September 20 at 4 p.m., I learned that she no longer had feelings for me as a boyfriend, even though I would always be a close person to her. That everything had become complicated. That the last thing that kept her was that I helped her with her work. That we are different people with different lifestyles. That we have different views on what it means to be a man and what it means to be a woman. That the magic between us was gone. That she was tired. She said that now she wants to focus on her work. And that there were some things she didn't like in Vienna, but since it was her first relationship, she was afraid to say anything. 

I was devastated and said that I considered it a betrayal, even though I didn't hold a grudge or blame her. That I wouldn't communicate with her the same way I don't communicate with my other exes. That in order to accept her again, I would have to kill my love, and killed love doesn't come back. 

So we said goodbye. At the end, she said it was cool.

That hurt me even more, because then why the hell are you leaving??? I didn't say that.

For four weeks now, I've been watching her on morning calls two days out of five. She's in the office and can be seen on camera while I'm conducting these remote calls (yes, I'm considered very successful at our work, and she was told this more than once before we broke up). Of course, on the outside, she is completely calm. To be fair, so am I, but inside, I am going through a terrible storm at these moments.

Just like 80% of the last four weeks.

Now I am living with a friend, without my own home, with problems of re-legalization in another country, with a terrible emptiness inside and fatigue from constant thoughts and a racing heart. 

I've had difficult breakups, even breakups where my partner left me for someone else. But this was the most devastating. It was as if a part of me had been torn out, and now it hurts a lot.

She was always afraid of breaking up, she didn't even like to think about it, she saw me as her future husband and talked about it all the time, there was no sign that anything was threatening our relationship. 

And then, very abruptly and suddenly, it ended. We were one step away from an apartment. We were supposed to move to Vienna for a while and then return to Ukraine, building our careers, caring for each other, and admiring each other. 

But she left. In four weeks, I haven't come close to accepting it because I don't understand. I've read tons of information about burnout, shutdowns, emotional rebounds, the workings of oxytocin, dopamine, and so on. And I still don't understand. I don't understand emotionally, unfortunately.

In her threads, she has some kind of reflection about trust in the path, strength as a curse, a happy future. And in my heart, there is a frosty downpour with no signs of clearing up. 

I know I'll get out of this hole. But being in it is awful.

1o6n3m3,am i in denial?,"I (24F) have been struggling to make a decision on whether or not i should breakup with my boyfriend (24M). He‚Äôs my first real boyfriend and we have been dating for almost 3 years. He‚Äôs perfect on paper and everything I thought I needed in a boyfriend. He‚Äôs kind, funny, smart, motivated, we have similar political views and want to settle down in our home city. He is all about me and tells me daily how grateful he is to have found me. As someone super anxious, having a boyfriend who constantly tells me how much he loves me has been amazing. i have some health issues that have subsided in recent months, but he was always caring and gentle with me when i thought i was asking for too much. he has never made me feel like too much and has allowed me to be myself. but, for a long time ive had this nagging feeling that he isn‚Äôt the person i‚Äôm meant to marry. at the beginning of our relationship, we had some issues with social media. not cheating, but he was always sneaky with girls and i had seen past girlfriends/flings in his recent searches often. i also constantly saw him like bikini pictures and thirst traps. i am pretty terrible at confrontation, so telling him it bothered me took a lot out of me and he seemed to understand. but i had to have that conversation three separate times before it stopped. we had some other issues that i brought up that I had to bring up 2-3 times before anything actually changed. for example, he kept slapping my ass in public and i hated it. i first started with just saying stop, but nothing changed. so i had to sit down and tell him that its disrespectful to me. it subsided but he‚Äôll do it every so often this pattern made me question a lot of things. a lot of it comes down to what will happen in the long term. there are some personality differences that make me wary. he is very passive aggressive in public - like saying ‚Äúsome people dont know how to walk‚Äù like right behind someone or right after they pass. idk it just seems like unnecessary anger a lot of the time. and sometimes he has big reactions to small things (nothing ever towards me tho) and i try to keep him calm. and for him, he‚Äôll feel better after 5 minutes, but someone getting angry like that around me just jars me and ill be feeling uncomfortable for like 30 minutes. he says im his rock and his peace, but i don‚Äôt know if i want that. also, probably the biggest thing to me, is that we don‚Äôt have many in depth conversations. yes, about life and shows and everything we can chat. but for trauma and hard conversations, it feels like we shy away. we‚Äôve never played one of those ‚Äúwe‚Äôre not really strangers‚Äù games. Im more private and don‚Äôt really say anything unless asked- then i don‚Äôt have an issue opening up. but i feel like he‚Äôs the same way. i have friends who are more open to asking and answering questions than me, and it helps me be more open and make deeper connections- and i kind of want that with my partner. and whenever I bring something up, all his response is ‚Äúim sorry‚Äù. like no discussion, no explanation for behavior. and he‚Äôs never brought up an issue with me. it just feels like theres a lack of emotional depth. all of these things has been ruminating in my mind for a while. none of them seemed particularly damning in the moment, but more of a constant do i want this for a husband? this part makes me feel vain and selfish but- in the past year he‚Äôs been gaining a good amount of weight. when i first met him, and started dating him, he had gained a little bit of weight and had been insecure about it. he had a little belly but i honestly didn‚Äôt see an issue. he had been gaining weight little by little as we started dating. still no issue with me because i loved him. but in this past year, he‚Äôs gotten a job that has drained a lot of life out of him, causing him to gain a good amount of weight, mostly in his belly. because we smoke, i started getting worried about him. i have been regularly exercising since january and i approached it with the angle of health. how gym time can help you sleep better, and how it gives you more energy over time- recommending him to work out 2-3 times a week for a short amount of time just to get some exercise in after sitting at a desk all day. he took it pretty badly. he went a couple of times and just keeps saying how tired he is. and i totally get that - im chronically sleepy. But the part that i didn‚Äôt say is that he also eats like garbage. he‚Äôll eat fruit and veggies, but he‚Äôll eat a lot of unhealthy things in large quantities. like we went to get pizza and he was using dipping sauces for each bite. and we got a garlic wheel last week and when he was done with it he added parmesan in the marinara and drank it. in a conversation a month ago, i think someone had mentioned that they didn‚Äôt want to eat something because it was unhealthy and he kept saying, ‚Äúeh live a little‚Äù. i don‚Äôt think anyone should police your food, or tell you how to live your life, and i usually eat whatever i want but in moderation. i don‚Äôt think he values keeping a healthy diet. The fact that he doesn‚Äôt work out, eats terribly, and smokes all make me unattracted to him- especially since he has a big beer belly now. sex has been harder because i can‚Äôt get over the belly in the way and because he gets out of breath a lot faster now. i have adhd and rocd. i can‚Äôt tell if ive just been thinking about this for a while and that‚Äôs why i feel so damning. but now that the attraction has minimized, i can‚Äôt tell if this is worth saving. at the beginning, i couldnt belive i could find someone like him. he‚Äôs good with people and i had no issue introducing him to my friends. he makes me feel like the most perfect girl in the world and he would do anything i ask him to do. he‚Äôs such a genuinely great guy i dont know if this would be the worst mistake of my life- dating is so hard. but i can feel myself slowly pulling away and i think he feels it too. The thought of breaking up with him, though, is heartwrenching. it would crush him and he just deserves kindness. i cant tell if this is just rocd or a sign that we should breakup. he talks about marriage and kids and i feel bad feeling unsure in a relationship he‚Äôs so sure about.

TLDR: great on paper boyfriend , but a constant feeling that he isnt my husband. am i overreacting?",OldManufacturer770,1760465450.0,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o6n3m3/am_i_in_denial/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o6n3m3/am_i_in_denial/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o6n1zr,I feel so used by my recent ex and now I‚Äôm missing my first love,"I was with my ex for 4 years. He was an okay guy. We broke up a year ago but I kind of went insane trying to get him back. This past year I was missing him a lot and romanticizing him, not focusing on the negative things he did. He drove me crazy for 4 years. Lashing out when I explained my feelings, always tried to protect his reputation above all, was never being appreciative for all the help I gave him, and always being negative about my life decisions even though I knew what I was doing and why I was doing it. He was altruistic basically and had a big ego. I would spend time sending him jobs, showed him so many places like museums and restaurants, elevated his personal style. I would get him gifts and spend money on him. Nothing I did made him happy and nothing he did for me made me happy. I always went to his side of town and he was still always 10-15 minutes late. Looking back, I knew he was never serious about me, always pushing back conversations, never acknowledging or respecting my decisions. 

In the beginning of our relationship, he was really mean to me. I mean yeah we were young (18) but I should‚Äôve never forgave him for the things he did to me in the beginning. The first times we hung out, we would just hook up and I felt used. Overtime he eased up, kind of matured and tried to become better by not drinking or smoking and valuing dates over intimacy and stuff but still would do things like be friendly towards other women and also abandon me or make things harder when I needed help or support. In the beginning, I would go to his place when I wanted some space from family but shortly after I would go straight back home because he was driving me nuts. I kept trying to break up with him because it never felt right to me but I really didn‚Äôt want to be single and I thought this would be the best I ever had, he had a way with words. He would also try to fight for us to stay together and I was kind of lured back in. It was just a horrible cycle. I didn‚Äôt like him anymore but I kept trying but both of us were just dragging the relationship. I was just miserable with him and made him miserable in turn. Every time I broke up with him, I would meet him randomly like at the vet and he would say I love you or one time, when I gave his book back, he followed me to the bus stop and say I want to get back together. 

My mom despised him and she had really good intuition so I should‚Äôve trusted her. 

I never liked his friends, they were all weird people who put themselves down or were red pill. His family wasn‚Äôt much better either, his sister was a mute and his parents weren‚Äôt that nice even though I was around for 4 years. 

Anyways I think the biggest lesson I learned was to trust my intuition. If I want to break up or cut ties with someone, I‚Äôll stick to it instead of dragging it further and further, forgiving them and then becoming miserable and lashing out on them. You can‚Äôt change people no matter how hard you try to help them if they don‚Äôt want to be helped. 

Now I feel bad because I feel like this is my karma for how I treated my very first love. The guy who understood me, spent hours encouraging me, hurt when I was hurt, stood up for me when others made fun of me. I walked away from him like he meant nothing to me. He had his issues sure but he understood me like no one else and he cut off friends who would make fun of me. He would get me gifts, go on long trips to come see me when we were long distance, worked at his uncles construction shop so he could make money for us to go on dates, listened to all the songs I showed him. I checked his Spotify recently and in his playlists, I see he still listens to the same songs I sent him 4 years later. He loved me a lot and I took him for granted just like my recent ex took me for granted. I never told him how much he meant to me. I missed him a lot when I was with my previous ex even though I was too embarrassed to admit it. I tried to hate him a lot in order to cope with losing him. I focused on the negative things he did not realizing all the good he did for me. I constantly compared my ex to my first love. I would think, my first love would instantly shut down people for being mean to me or show me affection openly, make me feel needed and appreciated. When I was with my ex, I would wish my first love was there. I was open to my ex about it, I told him I would think of my first love sometimes but he would just ignore it like he always did with my feelings. 

I wouldn‚Äôt understand why my ex wasn‚Äôt acting like how my first love acted. I lashed out at my first love years later because I was hurt he didn‚Äôt fight for me when I left him. No one understood why I broke down out of nowhere years later despite being with someone but deep down I was frustrated I missed him years later. I was holding resentment and hurt. I knew I wasn‚Äôt happy with my ex and knew I wasn‚Äôt over my first love. 

I wish I could tell him how much I miss him but it‚Äôs too late for that. I hope one day he finds someone who truly loves and values him. I feel sad I hurt him so much but I got my karma in the end. My now *ex*, did a temporary restraining order on me, slandered my name, humiliated me in front of his friends and exposed me to everyone. He also probably has moved on a year later so there‚Äôs that. What a life. 

If there‚Äôs any women reading this, please just leave them if you‚Äôre unhappy. My last relationship got dragged out for 4 miserable years. I knew all along it wasn‚Äôt right for me but I still chose to stay. My mental health and life suffered staying with the wrong person. If you keep going back and forth not knowing if you want to break up with them or not, just break up, it‚Äôll be the best for you guys. I know a lot of women stay a lifetime with the wrong men but just leave them, there‚Äôs better out there.

1o6n0ed,Ex (29F) who dumped me (30M) has been regularly updating a breakup playlist,"She ended things saying I did nothing wrong and that I‚Äôd treated her amazingly.
I respected it and stayed no contact for 3 months.

I gave her about 7 weeks without reaching out before messaging from an alt account. I said I was not mad, that I am not chasing and that she is free to contact me about anything - however, let‚Äôs try not leave things on a sour note at least.

I stumbled onto her Spotify account after the block and noticed she‚Äôs been regularly updating a breakup playlist titled ‚Äúgetting over you‚Äù, adding new songs every few days.

1o6n02w,Confused and burning,"I'll keep it short as I'm really devasted. I've been dating this girl for almost a year now. Did everything for her. Listened to everything she had to say. Gave her everything she wanted Even without her asking. Loved her unconditionally. Obviously there were ups and downs she obviously did alot of mistakes but small thing to mention i completely changed myself for her. Never gave her a chance to even complain about the smallest things and always thought what will be better for her. She often did some things which I really didn't like. She talked to her ex once without informing me. She talked with random guys saying there my childhood friends, I'm talking to them about my work etc etc and i always told her to set her boundries as i wanted both of us to be on the same page. She told me that she understood what i felt like and said she'll never do anything like this again ever. This whole thing happened like 6 times and i always forgave her as i couldn't imagine myself without her. And these were all the things she did wich were related to a 3rd person she did alot more frequent careless mistakes repeatedly. 
That' a whole another story. But today i checked her instagram an there was a guy wo she already told me about and i was like ""cool i trust you"". But today i checked the messages and there was a text saying ""Good morning cutie"" i was little shocked obviously but after that there were other messages like he wanted to impress her, was constantly flirting with her and sent insta post like he wanted to put his arm around her waist, wanted to vist the shirine with her and travel with her etc etc. she didn't flirt back or never said anything that would give the guy any hint but always replied in a casual way and never confronted him or never told him to stop or never on her own blocked or ghosted him. I did tell her like a thousand times that I don't like this stuff and please set your boundries with other guys. Today i confronted her as usal and she said that he's my really good childhood friend and his intentions are not what you think. Like gurl I'm a guy too and I've done these things in the past too. She obviously realised for the 1000000th time she fucked up and started apologising and blocked that guy. But does it really matter that she blocked that guy after all this and after i confronted her? I told her that I've reached my limit which I actually have. I'm really furious and confused right now and wanted to know if i should really give her another chance or should i move on for better?

I just could not walk away. I had a lot on my plate. Still do. Today marks the one year anniversary. I‚Äôm sick to my stomach. We‚Äôve had TWO meetups in this past year. Both heaven on Earth.

In order for me to move there with him who does not have his own home, who sees his daughter once every other week, who isn‚Äôt in school and who works part time I‚Äôd have to give up my whole world.

1o6mg8s,Ex (F20) still has my (M22) things and owes me money. What would you do?,"We broke up close to six months ago, kept talking, then had a fight leading to no-contact. I was not emotionally apt to talk with her at the time, so I let time pass

Eventually I felt well enough to talk with her, and last week was her birthday, so I sent an happy birthday message, she answered, and we changed a few messages about how everything's been and what we've been up to. Since it was her birthday, it didn't feel right to talk about money and the breakup. She eventually left a message of mine has seen and the conversation ended (it was about university, nothing of importance)

A few days after that, I sent a text saying I get that she doesn't wanna chat and we both need to figure things out on our won, but that she still had my things. At the time she was in another city on vacation, so I also said that she didn't need to answer right away, as it was not urgent, but to say something when she came back. The message was not seen

A week went by, she's already back, and no answer, didn't even read it (she may have read part of the text from the notification). I sent another text this morning, asking her to answer the message so that we can deal with this, this was 8 hours ago, still not seen. I also said that it was unnecessary to complicate an uncomplicated matter

If she doesn't answer the next few days, my plan was to text her mother (which whom I still have a good relationship) and ask her to tell my ex to answer me. I never had reason to doubt that she would return my things, as I've returned hers, and neither do I doubt now, so that whole plotline is not a possibility. But what would you do in this situation? Am I doing things wrong?

1o6mci8,People who lack self awareness and are emotionally immature/dumb,"These are genuine questions I want to know. I just want to understand and to help myself approach things with a better mindset and open my eyes.

1) When a man/woman is emotionally dumb, do they actually notice their ex is gone at some point? Do they notice during no contact?

2) if the people who still wanted them back stopped chasing and suddenly they disappear and do no contact, would they still notice if they lack emotionally immaturity and awareness?

I have a friend who keeps insisting people who lack those things will not notice at all. Especially on avoidant people. And then my friend said if they DO then they will never approach or chase cause they will never want to admit it and just sit in silence and never resolve properly their feelings cause they would just suppress it and hide it.

She told me they aren't worth it. They simply hurt people and that they are so stupid and dumb to even realize anything at all before it's waaay to damn late. She got me questioning if they can even love people at this point. Is it true?

1o6ma8l,am i tweaking or no,"this is a bit of a long one with a lot of context, so i'll do my best to try and explain. 

**tldr (for context):** me and my gf had been together for 2.5 years and were doing long-distance for the past couple of months, as she's a year older than me and graduated from our college this past spring. over the summer, i was studying for the MCAT and doing research at college, while my gf started work at a company near her hometown. obviously, with both of us being extremely busy, we only really texted and facetimed the whole summer, save for a short trip we took together with our friend group. 

**the story:** we broke up 2 weeks ago because of an issue that returned from a couple months ago. in april 2025, she had found out one of her close friends had liked her around 2 years ago (2023), when me and my gf started dating. because of this, she had experienced a return of some feelings (til now, i'm not sure if they were just the remnants of ""what could have been"" or actual feelings). she told me about everything much after the event happened, and we had a long convo about the lack of communication and how that needs to get better in our relationship for it to progress. and we both agreed we're in it for the long haul. 

fast forward to the start of october 2025, my gf breaks up with me because of guilt for living at home and not being able to tell her parents (we both have extremely strict parents and this is an issue i wholeheartedly empathize with), feeling stagnant in her professional life and with her job, and not being able to figure out her feelings with her friend SINCE APRIL 2025, which i thought we had moved past and fixed. 

cut to me being frustrated that we spent a whole 6 months in our relationship with her still having some feelings and not communicating them to me. when i asked her about it, she mentioned that she had doubts sometimes about us but was just so comfortable in the relationship that she didn‚Äôt want to ruin it, and that over the years, maybe we outgrew each other but we will always be friends regardless of what happens. she also mentioned that she had stopped talking to her friend in an effort to really work on herself and become a better person and for me to forgive her in the hopes of seeing if a relationship will work again in the future. 

this is a girl that i see myself spending my life with, and i've communicated this to her so many times. we both have similar backgrounds, and i always thought we would navigate the emotional turmoil of coming out to our families together and live a happy and fulfilling life. of course, i can see that i was being a bit too idealistic, but you know when you have a gut feeling that this is the person for you? 

right now, we're no contact until she visits my campus again in a month for an alumni event, where we plan to check-in and see how the other is doing. 

**my questions:** i would wait for her and that's just me acting on the gut feeling that i have. is it wrong for me to do that, and does that hinder the progress we both need to make to eventually be in a relationship again?

1o6m9f6,i broke up with my boyfriend after a month,"and i dont feel bad about it at all. for context, i am 21, he's 20 and we go to different colleges in the same town. we started going on dates early july, he asked me to make it official late july right before i went back home (so we did long distance for almost a month), came back late august, broke up early september. we met on a dating app and i had told him that i wasn't sure i wanted a relationship, and he told me that he wanted something long term. i agreed to be his gf because it felt right in the moment. right after he asked me, he told me he loved me and made me feel bad for not being able to say it back (i didnt feel the same way). when i left i also left the country and had little to no service, so keeping in contact was hard, on top of a shitty time difference. 

when i came back in late august, he gave up on taking me out on actual dates, even tho he would always say he was going to, and would want to cuddle on my bed every time i had a moment of free time. whenever i wanted to make time for my friends, he would get upset and try to guilt me saying i was choosing them before him, when i was already spending most of my time with him. whenever i set up boundaries, he would eventually be ok with them but that was after always having to explain myself extensively. he also would pressure me into having sex, as we were both virgins, and even when i had told him about how i wasnt still mentally healed from my rape a few months before. we tried once but neither of us knew what we were doing and he only cared about himself in that moment so it didnt end well and nothing ended up happening. on other occasions, he only wanted me to please him and never made an effort to reciprocate even when he said he was going to. i eventually got really annoyed by him every single day, and dreaded spending time with him.

he was also kinda rude to my friends, and weird so i started feeling embarrassed to have him around. on one occasion, i was tickling him in the living room (my friends were also there) and he slapped my arm out of instinct. this had never happened on other times when i tickled him. it did hurt and leave a little bruise and he seemed apologetic at first, but when we talked and i was trying to brush off the conversation because i didnt feel comfortable, he eventually said that i was basically asking for it and that he didnt mean to. later that week, i called him and broke up with him on the phone.",commanderoranges,1760463667.0,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o6m9f6/i_broke_up_with_my_boyfriend_after_a_month/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o6m9f6/i_broke_up_with_my_boyfriend_after_a_month/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False

I have family that cares and loves me but they live over an hour away, I rarely get a chance to see them in person so I‚Äôm left all alone to process this immense pain on my own. Also to add I have zero friends I‚Äôve struggled with really bad social anxiety my whole life so making new ones it‚Äôs a challenge especially at the age of 25. Everyday is a war in my head, constantly thinking about what‚Äôs happened, first thing on my mind when I wake up and last thing when I go to sleep. I‚Äôve been having suicidal ideation, I‚Äôm too scared to actually do anything but the thoughts scare me because I feel relief thinking about not existing anymore.

1o6logu,"Boyfriend of two years broke up with me over a short paragraph message on Snapchat, is this a normal thing or a messed up thing to do.  üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà","So I‚Äôve been in this relationship for two years now, met at a party, got to know each other, moved in and have been fine other than the rare argument about something small and silly.

We were planning on getting a flat together potentially after the holidays and also me spending Christmas with his family. I am disabled and on some strong sedating medication so I understand that I can be more of a burden, however the way he broke up with me hasn‚Äôt really sat right and I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm overreacting :)

We had spent our money for a month (mostly my benefits) and he had to go back to his family shop to earn some money for us to be able to pay rent and things, we are currently living at my family house but had a flat ready and were planning to move in. He stops replying one day (texts and calls) but I don‚Äôt get worried or anything since I assume he‚Äôs just busy working or meeting a mate. 

When he does reply he says he‚Äôs been on a night out with his friends and is acting more blunt than usual, not long before asking for a break (on Snapchat) which I obviously accepted just to give him some space, two days go by with nothing and I ask ‚Äúare you breaking up with me or is this a break as I‚Äôd rather know now‚Äù and he breaks up with me over a short Snapchat message, I try to call and ask him to call and at least discuss it so I know what I‚Äôve done wrong or what I could have changed.
 
He gave the reason (as a short snap) of that he hasn‚Äôt been happy for a year (despite nothing seeming to change) and that he had no routine and needed to sort it (which is why we had a house planned next to his work) 
(I forgot to mention also I have had two family deaths in this last year, which have obviously contributed to a low mood on my behalf but was always trying to make plans, or make a small routine like going to the gym) 
I‚Äôm not sure where he is staying at the moment apart from it‚Äôs his home village

1o6lmk1,AI ruining relationships,"AI is quietly destroying trust ‚Äî not just in society, but in relationships. We‚Äôve reached a point where screenshots, videos, and even voices can be faked so convincingly that ‚Äúproof‚Äù itself has lost meaning. Studies show people misidentify AI-generated images as real nearly 38.7% of the time (https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13023), and are only about as accurate as a coin toss when trying to detect deepfakes (https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16760). That means a single fabricated screenshot or deepfaked video could make someone look like they‚Äôre cheating, lying, or living a double life ‚Äî and even if the truth comes out later, the damage is done. Deepfake abuse is already a massive problem: roughly 96% of deepfakes online are nonconsensual sexual content, with 99% of victims being women (https://opdv.ny.gov/tfgbv-deepfakes-and-image-based-abuse), and there are documented cases of people being gaslighted, blackmailed, or emotionally manipulated using AI-generated ‚Äúevidence‚Äù (https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15564886.2022.2036656). At the same time, AI is reshaping intimacy itself ‚Äî people are turning to chatbots and AI ‚Äúcompanions‚Äù for comfort, but research shows this can make them lonelier and less emotionally connected over time (https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/its-not-just-in-your-head/202408/the-dangers-of-ai-generated-romance), while others use AI to build fake profiles and lead digital double lives. When you can fake an entire relationship ‚Äî or destroy one with a single AI-generated image ‚Äî trust becomes the first casualty. The technology is moving faster than truth can catch up, and it‚Äôs not just ruining reputations; it‚Äôs eroding the very foundation of human connection.



I hope people understand where things are headed with AI. I use AI for ethical and normal reasons. Just like this post. Also this is to create Awareness of the situation.

1o6lk35,Thoughts after breakup..,"tl;dr

I was in a relationship with a guy. Our first date was great; I loved it. He drove four hours to meet me, and we had only been talking for a few days. Two weeks later, I went to meet him. We spent a few days together and decided we wanted to date. I don't know if we rushed it, but we just decided. It was a long distance, and things were pretty much good for the first two months. Then we started seeing our differences.

Whenever we were together, it was easy to talk and sort things out. It got messier when we were apart. There were good parts and bad parts. I was insecure, and I wanted most things the way I wanted them. I had too many expectations of him. He tried his best to give me everything he could. He did lack in some ways, which every human does. But I always felt like we could do better, while he never moved past those arguments and differences. He kept telling me that we had differences.

Then, ten months later, he went on a vacation with his family. We didn't talk, and he decided he didn't have feelings for me anymore and broke up with me. We haven't talked for days; it's been a month now. There were times I knew we were both happy, and it just felt nice. We wanted everything perfect without changing, mending, or compromising. I belittled him at times, not knowing how he felt about it. He kept telling me I see the worst in him. He was definitely trying. He never yelled at me, never said a bad word, never spoke down to me, nothing. I was constantly pushing him. I know he deserves better. I wish I had treated him as well as I could have. I wish I had been more gentle. But there was also a sense of laziness. Just 3-4 months in, he used to say that effort wasn't needed anymore in a relationship, and that just never sat right with me the whole time. Maybe he didn‚Äôt love me that much, or maybe we just weren‚Äôt meant to be..",Professional_Rip4158,1760462150.0,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o6lk35/thoughts_after_breakup/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o6lk35/thoughts_after_breakup/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o6lk2p,I‚Äôm not sure how to get over the guilt of throwing away someone who gave me unconditional love,"About a year ago, I broke up with my ex for the dumbest reason. I lied and told her I needed space because my sister got into a car crash, the truth was that everything in my life was finally going right, and I got scared. I felt like she was holding me back, even though she was the one who actually made things better.

I came clean to her a few months later and told her the truth. She took it calmly, said it was fine, and has since moved on. She‚Äôs got a new boyfriend now.

We don‚Äôt talk anymore except maybe seeing each other‚Äôs Instagrams, but every time I see something she posts, I get that heavy feeling in my chest. I can‚Äôt stop thinking about how pure and genuine she was. She had her struggles, depression, time in a psych ward, but she still loved me completely, even when I was messed up. I couldn‚Äôt handle that kind of love, and I threw it away.

Since then, I‚Äôve avoided relationships. There‚Äôs a girl I talk to online who‚Äôs really sweet and seems into me, but I just don‚Äôt feel anything back. I keep realizing I‚Äôm chasing the feeling of being loved, not the person.

I‚Äôm trying to move on, but the guilt and sadness still hit me hard. I cry sometimes when I think about how I treated someone who only wanted the best for me.

I now often heard form ppl/ friends that had ONS during a breakup of even a breakup that could lead into getting back together (still were in contact) but then met with people and became sexual or something similar as ‚Äúcoping‚Äù. Often those were ppl that normally are against things like ONS in general, felt bad afterward, sometimes didn‚Äôt even end the situation and didn‚Äôt enjoy it and ruined all chance of getting back together (often the people that wanted the relationship more than the other part)

If you have experience about this, why did you do it, what made you feel that you doing this step to going to his home especially if you actually never did or like things like that etc etc.

1o6lftq,"Broke up while I‚Äôm across the country for an internship, and I now have absolutely nobody.","I‚Äôm 21 and just ended a 2 year relationship. It felt like forever‚Äîshe was the only person who truly knew me through everything. I‚Äôve only had one close friend since high school (my now college roommate), so she was basically my only real connection.

She checked every box for me, even the specific ones I thought no one else could. We were medium-distance, at different colleges a few hours apart, seeing each other 1‚Äì3 times a month for several days at a time. Those times we did get to see each other were essentially us living alone together and were the absolute happiest times of my life. I‚Äôve never felt that kind of closeness before.

A few months ago, I found out she cheated earlier in our relationship during a night of bad decisions. We reconciled; she was genuinely remorseful and worked hard to rebuild things. But since then, I‚Äôve treated her worse, especially when we have stretches apart. Now I‚Äôm across the country for an internship, and we finally broke. In just a week of no contact, she already seems to have found someone else to distract her.

I have no one here‚Äîno friends, no family‚Äîand I can‚Äôt focus or sleep. I‚Äôm shaking constantly and thinking about her every moment. I‚Äôm going to be stuck here until December with nothing.

I‚Äôve never had much success dating (only one other girlfriend, who I felt unfulfilled with). It feels impossible to imagine ever being able to find something that can match what I had with this girl. I know logically it sounds stupid, I‚Äôm young, she cheated, but I just can‚Äôt get past it. I got so lucky finding a girl who checked every single box and is so far beyond my capability to ever find again. I‚Äôm clearly just inept seeing as I have had literally one close friend in the last 7 years (technically a second, who‚Äôs now dead).

This is my first ever confession or asking advice about my feelings.. so please be kind and genuine 

It has been 2 years and i have recovered a lot from trauma i faced (although I don't like to name my bad life experiences as trauma but it is what it is)  but there's still something in me which is keeping me away to fully express my feelings in front of anyone...

There was a situation in which i had so many things to say or complain to my ex but everytime i tried to do so, it makes situation worse, I decided to stay quiet so that things would be better but i realized it was mistake... me being quiet doesn't make any difference and eventually i was alone...

Now, my situation is that i can't express those feelings or trauma to anyone, and i had childhood traumas too.. i cant trust anyone...

There is another girl, she's fully into me and said she loves me but I can't get attached to her or i cant feel anything, we(me and 2nd girl) are not in contact now, we had so many arguments just because i was trying to explain that i am not in situation to start new relationship..

1o6l6vp,Should I send him this letter? 10 years of love that keeps coming back but never lasts,"Hi everyone,
I‚Äôve been reading here for a while, but today I finally felt the need to write.
My story with him started when we were both 18.
It‚Äôs been 10 years now, a mix of real love, deep connection, and endless goodbyes.

It wasn‚Äôt one-sided.
He‚Äôs come back to me again and again over the years, every time saying he missed me, that I was the one who made him feel safe but alive.
But every time things got too real, he‚Äôd pull away again.
He‚Äôs what people would call avoidant. He runs when love stops being light and starts being deep.

The truth is, I never stopped loving him.
Even when he disappeared for months, I‚Äôd still find myself hoping.
And when he came back, it always felt like no time had passed, like our hearts still recognized each other.

But the pattern never changed.
He loves me, but he‚Äôs afraid of me, or rather, of the part of himself he becomes when he‚Äôs with me.
He once told me that being with me made him feel ‚Äútoo much,‚Äù like I saw through him completely.
And maybe that‚Äôs why he couldn‚Äôt stay.

After all these years, I‚Äôve accepted that I can‚Äôt change him.
I‚Äôve tried patience, silence, kindness, nothing ever made him feel safe enough to stay.
And now, after his last message saying it‚Äôs definitely over, I still can‚Äôt tell if this is truly the end or just another pause in our cycle.

So I wrote him a letter.
Not to chase him, not to fix anything, but because after ten years, silence hurts more than honesty.

The Letter:

I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôll ever read these words,
and honestly, it doesn‚Äôt even matter anymore.
I‚Äôm not writing this for you to understand, or to come back.
I‚Äôm writing because there comes a point where silence becomes heavier than pain itself.

You said it was over.
Definitively.
And for the first time, I didn‚Äôt try to change your mind.
Because I know what you call ‚Äúover‚Äù isn‚Äôt the absence of love,
it‚Äôs your escape.
You never knew how to stay where you were truly seen.
You never knew how to handle deep, steady, sincere love.

I loved you in your light, and forgave your shadows.
I loved you when you were present,
and even more when you disappeared.
I looked for you in my silences, in my prayers,
in every choice I made.
And you know what?
I loved you in the purest way possible, without owning you.
But you never knew how to love without running away.

I don‚Äôt blame you.
You are who you are,
a man who confuses freedom with distance,
desire with fear, love with control.
You wanted to experience everything except depth.
And I wanted to feel everything, even if it burned me.
That‚Äôs the difference between us.
I had the courage to love until I lost myself,
you preferred to leave before finding yourself.

Before, I doubted myself.
I thought maybe I wasn‚Äôt enough.
Maybe you wanted to travel, to live, to meet other women.
Maybe you were searching for something I didn‚Äôt have.
But now I know.
There was nothing to find elsewhere.
Because what I gave you,
you‚Äôll never find again.
And I say that without arrogance, just clarity.

I don‚Äôt blame you for not choosing me.
Because truthfully, you couldn‚Äôt choose someone
you weren‚Äôt even capable of facing.
It wasn‚Äôt me you ran from,
it was everything you felt when you were next to me.

I‚Äôve loved you since I was 18.
Do you really think I don‚Äôt see every side of you?
Do you really think I haven‚Äôt understood your silences, your fears, your contradictions?
I grew up with you, in your shadow, in your absences.
I know your wounds, your fears, your patterns.
And it‚Äôs exactly because I know you so deeply
that I can‚Äôt bring myself to hate you.

You said you gave me everything, that you have nothing left to give.
But if you really think about it,
what did you actually give me?
Everything a man gives to the woman he truly loves,
I never received from you.
Not a real gesture, not proof, not even a place in your world.

Ten years, ten years of emptiness.
Ten years where I was always waiting,
and you were always leaving.
Ten years where you said you loved me,
but never built anything beside me.

And yet, you knew.
You knew that if you had taken one real step toward us,
just one,
everything would have fallen into place.
Everything would‚Äôve been peaceful.
But peace scares you.
Because loving without chaos
forces you to face the truth,
your own fear of closeness, your own need to run.

Look at this last year alone.
Twelve months.
You were with me for maybe three,
and the rest you spent running,
from me, from yourself, from what we could‚Äôve been.
And still, I waited.
I listened.
I supported you.
I was there when no one else was.
I loved you unconditionally,
and never asked for anything,
not a gift, not a dinner, not an effort.
All I ever wanted was you.

But you took everything for granted.
You had me without seeing me.
You loved me without ever choosing me.
You say you‚Äôre empty now,
but that‚Äôs because you never knew how to give fully.
You loved halfway, afraid love would consume you.
But that‚Äôs what love is,
burning, a little.
And I burned for both of us.

So think about it.
Not about what you tell yourself,
but about the truth you keep avoiding.
You didn‚Äôt lose a ‚Äúnice‚Äù woman.
You lost the one who would‚Äôve waited for you forever,
if only you had respected her.

You can keep running,
keep chasing new faces, new noise,
but one day, your escape will catch up with you.
And when it does,
it will bring you back here,
to what you ran from,
a love that was real, deep, steady, rare.

I‚Äôm not closing the door.
I‚Äôm living, rebuilding,
but my heart isn‚Äôt closed.
It‚Äôs just wiser now, calmer, more grounded.
I‚Äôm not waiting for you, but I know.
I know you‚Äôll think of me in your silences.
I know you‚Äôll understand, late, maybe too late,
that it was me you truly loved.

And when that day comes,
I don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôll be.
But I hope you‚Äôll finally have learned to love
without running.
Because when you do,
you‚Äôll realize it wasn‚Äôt me you lost,
it was your peace.

‚∏ª

I honestly don‚Äôt know what to do.Should I send him this letter or keep it to myself? Part of me feels like I‚Äôll regret it if I don‚Äôt, but another part is scared it‚Äôll only push him away again.Please be honest with me.
Do you think a letter like this can actually make a difference?
And please, don‚Äôt tell me to ‚Äúmove on.‚Äù
If it were that simple, I wouldn‚Äôt be here.

1o6kv0j,I deserved my breakup,"Hi. I don't post on the internet in general, so this is a little throwaway account. I hope I can get some honest advice on what to do. Also, english is not my first language, so please spare me.

I'm 19 years old and my ex-girlfriend is 20, and we were on a relationship for 1 year and 7 months. We are long distance but we did meet in early July during both our birthdays. It was the best moment of my live. I never was on a relationship nor interested in one. But she was special. She took me off this shell I've build for multiple years of wanting to be alone and I fell in love with her.

3 weeks ago we broke up. I was a bad boyfriend and this was something that was building up. I never cheated on her, never talked to any girls. She's the same. We both didn't have many friends. I had some fake friends which eventually I cut off and she had just one friend, female, but they didn't talk much.

So it was me and her against the world, at least that's what I hoped it was. We argued a lot. Unfortunately our dynamic didn't work but I just wanted her. I love being cared for, love words of affection. So that's what I did to her. Was there for her, tried to be the most supportive for her even if it meant to throw away my mental health for her. I wanted to see her happy, but I was just doing worse.

If she didn't act caring nor loving I would be sad, and sometimes even mad. She wasn't consistent in showing love, while I was, and that bothered me. I told her many times I wish she was loving and I shouldn't.

She was really affectionate during the beginning but eventually things fell down, she wasn't affectionate and I was trying to push something that didn't exist, and when it didn't work I would be mad.

I was immature, I wasn't the bigger person when needed, I should've accepted those days she didn't feel affectionate, but my mind couldn't. I was overthinking everything, if she didn't say that she loved me that day or spoke to me in a different way I was assuming the worst.

I don't know what to feel. I tried to get her back, but she doesn't want the responsibility of being on a relationship. Even after post-break up I didn't act right. I removed her from every social media, and hours later added her back (which of course she didn't accept), I begged for her back, gave her money when she needed for food and even bought her flowers. But didn't give the space she wanted. I'm trying my best to give it to her. 

I miss her. She was my only person, where I felt happy. I just want her back. I know that giving space is what I should do but I wanna message her. I don't message her 24/7 but I cannot go a day without messaging. I wish I could do therapy but I cannot afford it. 

She told that we're in different places in life and doesn't feel much love for me at the moment. We were supposed to spend Halloween together, our favourite holiday, I was so excited for it. I was gonna hug so tightly but now it's cancelled.

I'm trying to focus on myself. Trying to understand her, trying to be the best for her. I just want her to comeback.",Front_Ant_3934,1760460631.0,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o6kv0j/i_deserved_my_breakup/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o6kv0j/i_deserved_my_breakup/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False

1o6koyw,"My wife left me after 9 years. I‚Äôve done everything to change and heal, but she says she‚Äôs done. I can‚Äôt imagine life without her.","Hey everyone,
This will be long, but I really need to share the full picture.

My wife and I were together 9 years, married 5. The first five years were truly great ‚Äî we laughed constantly, shared every interest, and built a partnership I thought would last forever.

Then Covid hit. I lost my job, and with her support I tried to start two different businesses. Both failed. My confidence crashed. I eventually joined her business as a wedding photographer and videographer, but we struggled financially, and I sank deeper into depression. I became negative and bitter. She begged me to get help, but I thought I could handle it alone. I couldn‚Äôt.

In 2021, I found out she‚Äôd been having an emotional affair online ‚Äî messages, photos, video calls, and him saying things like ‚ÄúI miss your voice‚Äù and ‚Äúcan‚Äôt wait to see you.‚Äù It broke me completely. She said it was never physical, and I chose to forgive her, but something between us shifted after that. Trust was never quite the same, even though we kept trying.

I also had anger issues. I never got physical, but I said cruel, cutting things in fights ‚Äî things I‚Äôll regret for the rest of my life. I started working on my anger and triggers, but for too long I was still reacting from pain and fear instead of calm and understanding.

This year, she got pregnant in June. I was so excited to start a family, but she said she didn‚Äôt trust me enough to have a child with me and decided to terminate the pregnancy. I was devastated. We started arguing more after that, and one day in early July, after a fight over text, I came home to find she had taken all her things and left.

That‚Äôs when I finally faced everything. I signed up for therapy immediately and asked her to try couples therapy too. For 3 months, I worked harder than I ever have ‚Äî learning emotional regulation, taking accountability, listening without defensiveness, and focusing on healing my depression. Our sessions went well, and for the first time in years, things between us felt calmer, safer, and almost hopeful.

Then she got a new job six hours north ‚Äî in the exact area we‚Äôd dreamed of living together. I was genuinely happy for her and supported her completely. It felt like maybe this was the next step for both of us.

But after she moved, she grew distant. She barely replied to messages. I tried to respect her space, but my anxiety got the best of me, and I reached out too much. I have an anxious attachment style, and she‚Äôs fearful-avoidant ‚Äî so my need for closeness made her pull away even further.

During those last few months, I also noticed things that confused and hurt me. She stopped wearing her wedding ring to weddings she photographed. Later, I found her deleting messages and talking to other men online. She denied anything was going on, but it deepened my sense that she‚Äôd already emotionally checked out ‚Äî even while we were still trying in therapy.

One weekend, after a full week of barely hearing from her, I finally told her it wasn‚Äôt fair to leave me hanging and that I needed to know the truth. A few minutes later, she sent a message saying she didn‚Äôt want to continue the marriage anymore, that she didn‚Äôt want to rebuild connection, and not to contact her except about our belongings.

That was last week.

I‚Äôm devastated. I‚Äôve taken full accountability for my part ‚Äî my anger, my depression, my emotional neglect, my failure to get help when she begged me to. I‚Äôve been in therapy for months, stopped smoking weed, built healthy routines, and learned to stay calm even when triggered. But she‚Äôs gone. She says she‚Äôs been emotionally detached for a long time.

I can‚Äôt help but feel like my growth came too late for the person I love most. I truly believe we could have had a beautiful life now that I finally understand what I didn‚Äôt before.

I‚Äôm not here just to vent ‚Äî I want to understand.
If anyone has been in this position ‚Äî where real growth came after the breakup ‚Äî how did you move forward?
How do you forgive yourself when the timing of your change cost you your marriage?

1o6khhr,I need to cut off my Ex for good and am struggling,"My ex (32nb) broke up with me (33m) roughly 2 months ago and today I got told about their new relationship despite them wanting to get together again in the future.   
To preface this, this was also my first relationship in 15 years, I actively didn't date in that time as  I have trouble trusting others, so this was a very big step for me. We were together for 14 months.

The alleged reason for the breakup was both our worsening mental health, especially their burnout, which they developed one month into the relationship. One month prior to the break up they suddenly got into their head that the only thing that could help them with their burnout would be to try polygamy with a woman they conveniently got close to the same month without telling me they were attracted to her. I assumed them to be just friends.   
The break up involved me getting pressured to decide between polygamy or breaking up in 2 weeks. only to be broken up with anyways one week in. Then they suddenly admitted that they were self-sabotaging by doing this and just needed more professional help, which was something I could agree with. Towards the end our relationship was mostly me taking care of them because they were too scared to do anything by themselves. Their mom would drive them everywhere, they wouldn't really go grocery shopping by themselves. Because I have my own fair share of issues I was very patient throughout all of this. I tried helping them with emotional regulation, gave them space to talk, tried to get them to seek additional help, but they didn't want to do anything about this by themselves. We decided on focusing on getting better on our own for now and to keep the option of dating again open for the future.

But today they suddenly told me they started dating this other woman, while at the same time insisting that they want a future with me and how they want to spend the rest of their live with me. This was after already confessing that they had a crush on my best friend, then feeling compelled to confess to my friend twice, getting rejected, and then being upset that I was not as affectionate immediately after.

When I bring up how dating someone else while talking about still loving and wanting to marry me just hurts me and my trust in them more if they really want to date again, they apologize and immediately bring up how they ""have to focus on themselves now"", because apparently dating someone else is ""self-care"" somehow. It makes me feel quite angry.

No matter how many times I bring up that if you hurt someone, it makes sense to try to commit to changing or doing things differently if you want to keep our relationship, it all repeatedly comes down to them wanting to ""focus on themselves"". I genuinely am starting to feel like I am slowly going insane. Is it wrong to feel somewhat gaslit by this? What I wanted was for them to reconsider dating this woman, especially because their stated reason for doing so is loneliness and not actual romantic affection for this person

After today I do know that it's for the best to never be (romantically) involved with this person again, but I need some encouragement to cut them off.

With that being said, I live with my fearful avoidant narcissist ex who has BPD. No shade to them just the truth. We share a child together. Distance came into the picture on their behalf about 4 months ago. Hit pretty hard almost no time for us or family just out with friends. It became exhausting and one day I said something about it. Then excuses and disrespect rose out of nowhere. Resentment and space built on both sides but I'm still giving effort and trying to solve the problem(which is my typical role in our decade long relationship) fast forward 2 months later I ask her tell me it's over because I needed to hear it. My brain couldn't process the acts of her acting single while I sit and wait so I looked for clarity. The next day I ask if this is what they want for sure. They said yes even though I asked if I wasn't around when they came back. Dealt with the hurt the pain the heartache. She's been doing her thing living her life. Going out sleeping out. I then stumbled upon no contact and I tried it. I used it only with the exception of household or family related issues. I continue working on myself and my future and I'm in a way better place now. I don't think about the pain anymore. I kill her with kindness and respect but keep it very simple and straight to the point. Now over the past month there has been so many attempts for conversations about stupid shit, breadcrumbs and even pettiness to get me to respond. I stay strong and don't give in. They say they want to come back into the bedroom (back issues) cook more (weight loss/meal prep) attempts to be my friend (jokes/telling me about work and life) future living situations( has no where to go I'm all they have) but I stay grounded and don't give in but I'm just curious to know what is this person truly getting at?

1o6k8aw,It took me 8 months to move on ‚Äî but I finally did.,"I ended a 3-year relationship back in January.
I didn‚Äôt follow the usual advice to go no contact. I tried to stay friends, tried to reconnect, tried to fix things ‚Äî for months. In April, we gave it another shot, but it lasted only two weeks. She ended things again, and I completely fell apart.

I went through one of the hardest periods of my life. Anxiety, depression, sleepless nights, days where I couldn‚Äôt even get out of bed. I kept trying to talk to her, to convince her, to get her back ‚Äî but nothing worked.

In June, I found out she was seeing someone new.
Even then, I still tried. Until she got cold and distant ‚Äî and that‚Äôs when it finally hit me. I stopped contacting her. That‚Äôs also when I discovered this subreddit and started reading people‚Äôs stories.

And something changed.

Two months later, I was finally starting to feel like myself again. I was learning to enjoy my own company, spending time with friends, feeling peace for the first time in a long while. My ex had already introduced her new boyfriend to our group of friends ‚Äî and surprisingly, I was okay with it.

In August, when I least expected it, I met someone new.
And she made me realize why everything had to happen the way it did.

I started to see things clearly ‚Äî how my ex had traits I didn‚Äôt actually want in a long-term partner, and how emotionally dependent I had become without even noticing. This new person came into my life with a sense of calm, of balance. She inspires me to grow, to experience new things, to look forward instead of backward.

I don‚Äôt know where this new relationship will go ‚Äî and honestly, that‚Äôs okay. I‚Äôm not scared anymore. Everything that happens teaches us something. Everything helps us evolve.

Eight months ago, I couldn‚Äôt imagine feeling this peaceful again. I thought the pain would never end.
But it does. It always does.

PS: When my ex saw me with this new person at a group hangout (while she was there with her new boyfriend), she texted me the next day ‚Äî not to get back together, but to finally apologize for everything. She took responsibility for how things ended, and even said she missed me.

I forgave her.
No resentment, no anger ‚Äî just closure.

So, if you‚Äôre going through it right now‚Ä¶ trust the process.
It hurts, it‚Äôs slow, and it feels endless ‚Äî but eventually, it all makes sense.
There‚Äôs always something better waiting for you.

A month prior to this he had wanted to break up before but over the fact that I dont want kids and he did(I told him day 1 I didn't want kids) this was also a surprise but we talked through it and I agreed that in a few years i would be open to the idea of having a baby.(im scared of child birth and of being a bad mom). We talked about names parenting styles everything. Just as my trust in him started to return to normal after blinsiding me with that conversation (he said he had been thinking about it for a month)
SIDE NOTE:he went to that same friends house before he blindsided me with this.
I know for a fact he avoids his emotions and his in distraction, the past year has been really hard on him and I know that, I wish I had seen how much he was struggling before. All he told be when we broke up was that he was too overwhelmed to be in a relationship and he just wasn't happy with himself or how he treats me and that he can no longer give me 100%. Now I know im far from perfect and definitely a little crazy i regret not giving him so much more when i had the chance. We have been no contact for 3 days now and I have lost 10lbs just crying with little sleep. I miss him so much he really did treat me so amazing, he is perfect in every way to me but he thinks hes hurting me?
I dont wanna break contact ( he still has me on a few socials) im scared to push him away to the point where he wont come back. He told me that he wasent saying no to coming back just that he didnt know.

Everyone in my life is giving me different opinions and its making it so much worse.

1o6jkxw,I feel like I blindsided my ex and feel immense pain,"We were together for over a year (maybe 16 months at most) and we split things off a week ago. She stood by me through some of tough times, and I did with her. She works long hours in film and has other people that she's responsible for so her time was limited and though she made time for me it was always based around other's schedules.

I was unhappy thinking about living that way for years to come. Our first year together her work was slow and she was focused on building a business, I fell in love with the potential and how happy she was doing work that made her soul happy and brought out her feminine side. 

At a certain point (a little over half way into our relationship) I stopped feeling safe to share my feelings or whatever is bothering me. I would usually be dismissed or she would get frustrated with me and I end up apologizing for triggering her instead of feeling heard myself.

I had no idea how to talk to her about that. I started going to therapy (inconsistently because of benefits allowance) thinking that I'm the problem in every scenario and I was curious about anxious attachment and relationship anxiety.

The day of the break up, I called her on my lunch break, told her I've been in my head a lot, and struggled to ask her where she saw our relationship going. Her response was ""I've had this conversation a thousand times and this is the beginning of the end"". I had nothing to say and carried on with my day in turmoil.

That evening I walked with my friend and he expressed his concerns about my well being in this relationship and that I should seriously consider the commitment I'd be making. I thought about it all night and these indecisive thoughts weren't new. I would actually experience them every time we had space away from each other and they became increasingly louder.

I've had some anxious episodes with her in the past and every time she would basically say that ""she's a lot and here's an exit if you want"". 

Anyways I had been ""feeling off"" about the relationship for a few of weeks leading up. The weekend before breaking up we had some quality time planned, I was really hoping my feelings for her would change

My friends and family tell me that she's always been one foot out the door. I keep thinking about all of our good times and I really wish that things ended on better terms. I can't help thinking that I'm crazy for leaving, that I was always the problem, and maybe I am the narcissist. (She was previously married to one, I was recently roommates with one, she taught me how to recognize their patterns)

I really loved her. In the end I didn't know what I was feeling anymore, let alone what my needs or desires were. I got sucked into codependency and kept repeating the same bad habits; I would burn out every few weeks and feel exhausted because I would continue pouring from an empty cup. 

Night of the breakup, I called her and said ""I don't know what I want anymore and it's not fair to string you along. These thoughts have been heavy and killing me""

Next day, she texts me ""fuck you"", ""I trusted you"", and listed some of her problems for the day on top of ""I'm so mad at you right now"".

I said okay to all that and that I'm heartbroken too. I told her I care about her and I can't figure my shit out from within the relationship (I genuinely believed that because each time I thought I broke this pattern it would just happen again and worse). 

I added that I'm having an identity crisis and have some work to do on myself and then she just cut me off from all communication. I may have initiated the breakup but I feel like she completely discarded me and then labeled me narcissist.



Can somebody call me out if I'm the problem?
Did I act disrespectfully?
Should I have tried harder to communicate?
Am I narcissistic?


I know that I have issues to navigate and I've been busy with that. (Ongoing therapy)
I feel like I'm going crazy.
We have no contact but as far as I know, she is painting me as the villain.
I don't know who to trust (including my therapist at times).
I don't know if my feelings are actually valid or if people are just telling me what I want to hear.
I don't know if I'm just projecting my own bs.

I just don't understand how we got here. Now that I'm out of that, I feel a lot of relief but sometimes get incredibly anxious when I think about her.

There's so many unknowns that I'm unraveling and learning about",Little-Cap-1988,1760457803.0,1,0.67,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o6jkxw/i_feel_like_i_blindsided_my_ex_and_feel_immense/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o6jkxw/i_feel_like_i_blindsided_my_ex_and_feel_immense/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o6jk4v,"Should I reach out to my ex after 5 months apart and 4.5 months of no contact? (Dumper, 26M)","I (26M) broke up with my ex (25F) after 2.5 years together. We met in our last year of college and moved in together within a week. The connection felt easy and natural ‚Äî not ‚Äúfireworks,‚Äù but real compatibility. I thought she was the love of my life. 

I ended things because every time I brought up a need or concern, she‚Äôd get defensive or dismissive. For example, I asked to split bills more evenly (I was paying about 70/30 since I made more), and she called me a penny pincher, saying she‚Äôd never be with someone who cared about how much she made. She worked part time and never got a job in her higher paying industry that she had a Master's degree in. But it wasn't worth breaking up with her over, so I let that dynamic continue. 

We moved to a new city away from her family and when I brought up how often she went home (she was gone nearly half the time), she said I couldn‚Äôt ask her to choose between me and her family. So I let that go and swallowed my loneliness. 

Sex became another painful topic. I tried to express that I wanted to feel more desired ‚Äî things like sexy texts, intimacy outside the bedroom, or reciprocal oral. Her reaction was shaming and invalidating, particularly regarding reciprocal oral: 

1) ‚ÄúNone of my exes wanted that ‚Äî you‚Äôre weird for asking.‚Äù 

2) ‚ÄúI have sex with you when I don‚Äôt want to, that‚Äôs me focusing on your pleasure.‚Äù 

3) ‚ÄúMy girlfriends have maintenance sex with their boyfriends ‚Äî you could have it worse.‚Äù 

When I said that might be a dealbreaker, she laughed and said, ‚ÄúNo one breaks up over sex. What would you even tell your family?‚Äù 

These comments really broke something in me. Even when she started trying harder near the end and changed her behavior, I couldn‚Äôt emotionally come back from that feeling of rejection and shame. So I ended it. She was blindsided and thought things were getting better. My regrets are: 

1) Not communicating my needs earlier or more effectively. 

2) Not realizing how burnt out I‚Äôd gotten before trying to communicate and then ending it. 

I‚Äôve stayed in no contact for about 4.5 months. Lately, I‚Äôve been wondering if I should reach out ‚Äî not necessarily to get back together, but to understand if reconciliation is even possible. Specifically: 

1) Could she live in the same city again (she‚Äôs very tied to her family)? 

2) Has she reflected or grown since the breakup? Can she understand her behavior and could we have better communication? 

3) Would she even trust me again? 

A smaller part of me fears she‚Äôll move on while I might not. 

I haven‚Äôt reached out because I don‚Äôt want to hurt her healing or confuse things if I‚Äôm still uncertain. But I‚Äôm struggling to tell if this urge to contact her is me missing her or just missing connection.

1o6jfqg,Dismissive Avoidant discarded me coldly,"I guess I (30F) didn't realize he (29M) was an avoidant but I'm pretty sure after this that I can be sure about it.

We were together two years ago and I ended things because he betrayed me during a visit (we are long distance). Started talking again 7 mo ago, he put in a lot of effort and made it sound like he had changed and took accountability for the past. He even booked a flight to see me so that we both knew it was serious (he would have been here for two week,  two months from now)

About a week ago I texted him because I was a little anxious about not hearing from him for a couple days (it was going against his normal texting patterns). I said it calmly and cordially that the silence was making me confused/concerned for things on where we stand (in the past he would bail a lot and not respond for days, and I had told him before that I still do not fully trust him but I'm working on it and he said that he understands) and I would have appreciated a quick response if he could.

I know I was also in a weird mental space, extra anxious because my pet had just died a couple weeks before.

Anyway, he got defensive and started sending me a lot of texts as if I was attacking him, he was also accusing me of things that I haven't done, and if it's something that made him feel that way, he definitely had not told me before or ever brought something like that up to me.

I obviously got frustrated and told him that none of that was true (in a another long message, I did not use those exact words and I was very kind about it, and made sure to tell him that I cared about him it would never intentionally do something to hurt him) 

The last text I sent was apologizing for all the messages, but just letting him know that we're both in a complicated spot because of the past and I think we should drop this argument, and then I told him that I want things to work with us 

Anyways, he didn't respond for 5 days at all to that, and then texted me very coldly that he canceled his flights and wanted to end things with us.

This goes against everything he's been saying to me, and how he's been acting for the past 7 months. He was always telling me how much he wanted us to be together, planning the future, calling me pet names, planning his trip when he was here, alluding to the fact that he loved me and just wanted to tell me in person.

I'm just confused and hurt about how he made it sound like it was my fault he ended things when I've tried to be so caring and empathetic to everything he's been through and done.

He literally said that this was an easy decision for him to make in the text that ended things, no other explanation besides that he doesn't want to do it anymore.

1o6jfo9,i dreamt about her last night and got closure via dream,"i have kept a dream journal for years. sometimes, my dreams are nonsensical. other times, they are freakishly prophetic. and others, they feel extremely real.

the night before she unexpectedly broke up with me, i dreamt i was an old man whose lover died. i rose up to heaven and desperately tried to cling to her, but she disappeared into smoke despite my best efforts to keep what i knew i couldn‚Äôt. i fell from the sky like icarus burned by the sun. i forgot i had had this dream until, several nights after my breakup, i checked my journal and found it.

i‚Äôve had many dreams about her since then. mostly, they‚Äôve just been making me feel terrible in the morning. recently, i found out that she‚Äôs already moved on to another man (despite her reasoning for our breakup being that she needed to work on her approach to romance, so she wouldn‚Äôt date anyone for a long time. i also happen to have been friends with the guy in question at one point), which has exacerbated my emotional injury quite a bit.

i dreamt about her again last night, but this time was different. it wasn‚Äôt just sadness for the sake of sadness. in this dream, i was able to speak to her again. we happened to be in the same place at the same time in this dream. it was terrifying and awkward, but we broke down the barrier and began to go back and forth like we used to.

i woke up and fell back asleep, which allowed some time skip in the dream. we were talking. i don‚Äôt know where we were. we might have been getting coffee several months down the line.

she told me that we cannot rekindle our romance because she cannot love me the way i love her. i love her a lot. i would have done literally anything for her‚Äîchanging my career path to make more money to support her, straining my familial relationships because they disapproved of her, etc. she loves me a little bit‚Äînot even enough to go to therapy with me to work on things. for this reason, she said that i need to move on and find someone else.

i was about to argue. i love her so much that i can work with only being loved a little bit. it‚Äôs okay if she can‚Äôt love me the way i love her. i don‚Äôt care.

but she read my mind and said, ‚Äúyou cannot hang your whole life on a little bit of love, op.‚Äù

i thought of how i had wanted a family and kids with her. she once told me she wanted the same, but she had since changed her mind, and that‚Äôs that. if we rekindled our romance, i would still be hoping for a future that she would never be able to give me.

and with that realization, i woke up.

i‚Äôve been hoping to rekindle our romance for seven weeks since she left me. even now that she‚Äôs dating someone new, there‚Äôs still been this part of me that hasn‚Äôt been able to shut the door.

but hearing those words from her mouth, even just in a dream, gave me so much clarity. for the first time in weeks, i woke up feeling at peace.

1o6j61r,My ex is telling me he didn't cheat by going on a dating app and I am confused.,"Hi. My ex, in the beginning of our relationship, told me that going on a dating app while we are dating is absolutely unacceptable, and he considers it cheating. I agreed to it as well, because it made sense to me. 

A few months earlier, he said he needed space, or we could just break up because it's been exhausting to remain mentally stable while being in the relationship, so I gave him the space we needed. Things started moving slowly between us, and there were fewer calls, and even fewer texts. 

Recently, there was a miscommunication between us, and we had a massive fight. Things got incredibly rough between us, and we didn't talk for days. Slowly, things got better, and we were just about to be back on track, when he (incredibly drunk) told me that he went on a dating app. I couldn't understand what was happening at that moment, so I just replied with hums and left the conversation. 

The next day, it dawned on me that I had been cheated on. At least, I felt cheated on. When I confronted him about it, initially, he agreed he cheated, but then, his story changed to him already having planned to leave me, and considering that he told me he was not mentally stable enough to keep the relationship going, it doesn't count as cheating. 

But, isn't a break up supposed to be a mutual decision? And, even if he has expressed his desire to leave, I genuinely made sure to do everything I can to find a solution to the problems, instead of agreeing to the break up. 

Is my ex right, or am I right?

1o6j2lj,A Month and Half Since I heard his voice - What I have learned :),"My ex reached out to me two weeks after he dipped out in a horrific way. Two weeks later after he abruptly made the choice to end things after I found out some not great things about something he did. He literally just texted me the link to a song that was about how sorry he was (I won't say the specific song). I left him on read. I was so confused and honestly so hurt that he couldn't just text me his thoughts. I understood why he sent the song, but all I truly wanted was a good final conversation with him after he continued to hurt me the way he did. He just ran away. It has been a month and a half since we last talked. It has been a month since he sent that message. I want him to text me again or hell maybe call, but at the same time it was closure enough realizing the way he treated me at the end of things. I know I am no perfect person, I know I have made mistakes, but what he did was hurt me on a different level and he just got to run away from it and drag me to the ground in the process. I am angry, I am sad, and weirdly happy. I feel more myself than I have in a long time. I have been achieving major career goals and doing wonderful things in my social life. Just sometimes when I get a quiet moment I find myself recognizing this deep pain that he caused. All I can say is, when they contact you - you have to make a choice. I made the choice to not respond. I already gave him enough of my time, energy and hope, and in doing that again I would be disrespecting myself almost as much as he disrespected me. That was a personal perspective. I made the choice because I asked myself the question ""What would my response change?""  It wasn't going to make me feel better long term. In some ways it made me feel like I was pulling back power into my being by not responding. To me- leaving him on read was my way of saying ""You hurt me. You need to recognize that. This link isn't enough to change what you did."" Is it hard not to message back? For sure. Last night/this morning was honestly the hardest it has been to not respond. I blocked him on practically everything. Now I just need time. And to journal. Here are some good habits to follow within focusing on those things that I have discussed with a licensed therapist.

  
1. Block them and stop looking at their stuff (I have struggled with this a little especially when I have little moments of deep reflection - you may think that checking or talking to them will help, but It will just make you sad most likely. Plus social media can make anyone look anyway they want so it can make your mind do a number of things. ""Oh they look so happy without me!"" Maybe they are happy - maybe they aren't. Reaching out or looking won't help that.)

  
2. Stop comparing. It is sometimes easier to think of yourself in competition with an ex. ""Oh I have to get with someone before they do"" ""They look amazing and I look like this!"" Y'all seriously. Comparison is the thief of joy. FOCUS ON YOURSELF. By doing this I have no only started making wonderful connections with people - but I have also began to become to person I always wanted to be when I was with that person. That brings me joy.

  
3. GIVE IT TIME. Relationship grief is not a race. No one is going to win. Pain heals over time. I always say to myself - ""My life is going to look so different in a year"" or ""I am going to feel so different about this in a year"" Be kind to yourself. Give yourself GRACE. There have been amazing days that I forget that I am even going through a break up and then there are days that I miss his laugh and his voice in my ear. I continue to give myself grace and recognize with every tear I shed I am one step closer to growing into a better person and a better partner for the future love that comes my way.

  
4. FINALLY - acknowledge the hopes that you hold toward the past relationship and that person that is still in the world. I know I hope one day we will talk again. I know I hope he reaches out. I hope that something like that never happens to me again. Treat these thoughts as cars driving by in your brain. Allow them to come and go. What will happen will happen, what will be will be.

1o6ibcw,Day 2 of No Contact ‚Äî We work at the same company,"We‚Äôve been together for about 3 years, but the last 2 have been a cycle of breakups and makeups, usually over small things that kept growing into something bigger.

We both work for the same company, same compound, but different departments and buildings. So we see each other briefly every day. It was perfect in the beginning, she was hardworking, thoughtful, did the little things that mattered, and genuinely cared. I‚Äôll admit, in the start I said some hurtful things and didn‚Äôt treat her as well as I should have. But I learned, and I changed. The sad part is, when I started to do better, she started to withdraw.

For the past year and a half, it felt like punishment. The affection, the effort, the support, all of it faded. Sex became controlled by her. She became dismissive and cold, and only seemed focused on herself. I kept trying to match her energy, but deep down I knew it wasn‚Äôt healthy. She stopped checking in like at my desk or driving to see me at my home, stopped being kind, stopped caring and saying the L word, and started snapping at me anytime I tried to talk, yet still kept communication going on like nothing was wrong.

I spent that year trying to fix things while she continued pulling away. I doubted myself constantly, thinking I was overreacting or overthinking. Then, a few days ago, she finally said everything outright, confirming what I had suspected all along: that she was purposefully eroding the relationship. She told me to stop coming back and stop trying to fix it which was something she never said. So I did. I blocked her on everything.

She then emailed me, saying I wasn‚Äôt a good ‚Äúprovider,‚Äù that I wasn‚Äôt the man she wanted, basically trying to justify everything and compare me to her ex who did everything for her (she still fked him over also lol). It stung, but it also made things clear. She wanted luxury and validation, not partnership. I just didn't respond.

I would never be abusive or anything of the sort. It just isn't who I am. After 3 years together, we picked out an engagement ring, but I hadn‚Äôt found the right situation in which I wanted to ask her yet. To be honest, I was waiting for a very specific scenario to propose. I made this clear to her so she didn't think I had cold feet or anything. Unfortunately, about a year ago, she started distancing herself from me. Sleeping in another room and no intimacy, hardly even kissing. I expressed my feelings multiple times, but I admit I get emotional (sad, not mad), and it can make things hard. Although I get emotional, sometimes I still say what needs to be said. She, on the other hand, would basically shut down whenever I got emotional. We both agreed to go to couples therapy and try to fix it. After 3 sessions, the therapist made it clear that she wants separation. Then she back peddled on the whole separation thing. Then, on a night, I was busy she made plans to go out to a movie with a guy I didn't know. All she said was he was a friend. Then the next day a different friend, a mutual friend of both mine and hers, reached out to me and it turns out this other guy she went to the movie with was an ex-boyfriend. After finding this out, I decided I was gonna have to confront her about this, and it could very well end our relationship. I will admit it was hard to do because I was afraid everything would burn down around me, but I also couldn't let it continue to eat away at me. About 2 weeks went by, one night she was out late and I was at home. I texted her a few times, but she didn‚Äôt say much. I was worried about her being safe. She comes home and basically dismisses my worries and is very distant. Turns out that night she cheated on me with a different guy than the one she went to the movie with. A few days later, she admits what happened and that she is so sorry and that she wants me in her life, crying and everything. She also brought up how long it was taking me to purpose and how she felt like I prioritized my time with my friends more than her. I said it's too late to bring this stuff up now, though. I put my foot down and basically said you need to move out, and we need to go back to square one if we are to save our relationship. I also gave her 30-day eviction notice. She then decides later that night that the new guy is the one for her. I accept this as much as it rips my heart out. As the one who owns the home we live in, I made a simple request. I will respect her tenants rights as long as she doesn't go facebook official with this guy until she is moved out of my home. She agrees, but two days later, she goes official with him anyway. I begin to move all of her belongings into my garage so she can get them, and I tell her I don't want her living in my home anymore as she has no regard for my feelings. She basically breaks contact with me, and 32 days after her eviction notice her parents, who are completely sympathetic to my position, help get her stuff out. Seems to me her parents are just as confused with the situation as I am. Of course, they'll still do anything for their daughter, but they aren't happy. She has since then moved in with this new guy and quit her job.
I've been trying to heal and move on with my life. Sometimes I get upset with the situation, sometimes I cry, but I am moving on. It's been 2 months since she cheated. It is getting easier, but trusting someone again is gonna be hard. 
That concludes my story. If you have any questions, please ask.

1o6i61c,Relationship of (almost) 3 years ended yesterday,"I(F23) started dating K(M23) 3 years ago on Oct 15th. When we started dating we both made it clear we were asexual, so that was never an issue for either of us. 

We often went to his family's houses to visit, and we spent every holiday with his family. His mom called me her bonus daughter, and I often joked with his siblings that I was their older sister. We even talked about marriage and family and the future relatively often. 

K initiated the break up as he began to realize he was aro/ace and he felt he couldn't give me the romance I wanted in a relationship. He explained that he did still love me, and if anything would view me from a queerplatonic way, but not romantically. Over our relationship, there would be times where I found feel like we were just roommates. 

We agreed we would still be friends, and want to be important parts of each other's lives. Im devasted because I feel like my life was so intertwined with his, with me being so close to his family and me making plans to stay near him (my family is from 4 hours away). 

Our lease ends in December. We already had decided to move, so we will be going Our separate ways then. Im fine living with him, but I just feel lost. We share a friend group (his from high school) so im scared im going to lose all my friends. 

Im trying hard to see positives and to be happy for him that he's realized what he needs and his identity is. I just need support and love. Im new to this subreddit so sorry if this is rambly. The break up happened last night (yes, 2 days before our anniversary) and im just kind of sad and lost.

If anyone has any words of wisdom about finding love again, or how to cope id appreciate it. Thank you all in advance!

1o6hwnt,I am in the pits,"Had (what I thought was) the best 6 months with this guy. I basically upped sticks and moved across the UK into his home after 2 months. Spending 90% of our time together‚Ä¶for the first time in about 15 years I felt genuine happiness. He made me feel safe and loved.

Last week I felt something in my stomach after he‚Äôd called to say he was going out with a girl friend from work‚Ä¶I didn‚Äôt hear from him until the next morning. I was back in my home for a few nights but would see him the next day. A few nights later and after this feeling just wouldn‚Äôt settle, I went against all of my good intentions and looked through his phone. Saw messages with this girl which pointed only to one thing, and also consistent messages to his ex who he‚Äôd split up with a whole year ago. 

I immediately confronted him about it and he denied everything, saying he needed to go to sleep as he had work in the morning. He went nuts with me for trying to keep him awake. He left the next morning slamming the door and not saying a word to me.

It‚Äôs been about 5 days now and I‚Äôve returned home after he said he thought we needed space to breathe. He‚Äôs had the whole weekend to come and talk it through yet has gone about his weekend as usual - parties, football etc. His messages all say he loves me and he wants to make it work and will work on rebuilding my trust. But has now ghosted me for 2 days. It‚Äôs a totally different guy to what I‚Äôve known this whole time. I gave this guy everything (and I‚Äôve overlooked a bunch of other things which i don‚Äôt think many would at his age of almost 40). I‚Äôve been blunt in my responses and not desperate in the slightest so still feel strong‚Ä¶is he pissed he got caught or pissed he‚Äôs messed up?

But we split earlier this year when I was paying her phone bill and realized she was using it to talk to another guy who she is now in a relationship with. I basically disconnected her phone and blocked her. About couple months ago I tried to reach out desperately and was shut down and since then I reached out again but deleted it shortly afterwards. It comes in waves I miss her so much at times and at other times I get so angry thinking about her. I wonder how she was just able to walk away and I wonder if she thinks of me at all.

1o6ht6s,I'm currently going through a breakup and I know it's the best for both of us but I just won't stop crying,"I met my now exbf last September. we got along pretty nicely, and I fell in love for real. I kinda knew it wouldn't work out, but I tried to convince myself I was being paranoid. 
he's sweet, funny, cute, taller than me and so good looking... but I cried since the very beginning because he wouldn't talk to me about his feelings or about being official, and I didn't feel like I had the right to ask him for anything because I wasn't his girlfriend. 
I'm now his first exgf, so I understand it most have been hard for him experiencing some things for the first time. 
his family is quite traditional, and his mom never really liked me too much. his sisters adored me, tho.
I was recently diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, so that makes it kinda hard for me to sustain healthy relationships.
we had a lot of problems because of his insecurities, and I tried to be understanding even tho I'm not good with being empathetic. 
He asked me to stop seeing one of my bestest friends, who's a straight guy that has liked me for about a year now, and i completely understand why he didn't like me being around that guy, so I stopped hanging out with him. 
we broke up about 6 times this year, and got back together every time, of course. 
we saw each other about 3-4 times a week, since he's studying and working and I also work. 
he's 1 year and about 3-4 months younger than me, I was his first girlfriend, his first time, and the first girl he introduced to his family. 
his mom didn't like the way I dress, even tho I try and look appropriate almost always. 
I usually wear jeans and a tank top, though it's really hot where we live. 
on December last year, he traveled to visit some family, so I spent Christmas and New Years with some friends. we still weren't official, also. 
I walked for miles on heels with some of my friends to go watch the first sunrise of the year, and my feet were hurting like hell, so I put them on a guy friend's lap. some took a picture of us and sent it to my bf. 
he ghosted me. 
I convinced a friend we have in common to make him talk to me, and cried all day. I couldn't eat a single thing. 
he called me around 1 am, and I explained everything, and cried. he said he didn't think i was serious about being in a relationship with him, but I swear I was. 
after that, he started being a bit more paranoid or less trusting. there was this one stage on our relationship where we both blocked a lot of people and downloaded Life360 to know where the other was at all times. 
he started talking to my exgf one time after a fight, and they bonded through sharing stories about their not-so-good partners. he even sent her some food because she was sad. 
he showed me the conversation and I made him promise he wouldn't talk to her anymore, since she had already stolen a boyfriend from me. 
then, she and I started being friends again, and he was super against it, which i also understand because she's my ex, but I wouldn't had talked to her again if it weren't for him. 
our latest problem was I couldn't take it anymore. I'm not in a good headspace right now for a relationship, he's too jealous for me, doesn't like me partying but won't go out with me, I have plans he wouldn't like and our goals in life don't really get along. 
I love him like I had only loved once before. I actually fell in love again.
I didn't want to tell him about a guy I ran into on Friday, because I knew he wouldn't take it well.
this other guy isn't even my friend, we've spoken like 5 times, but during one of our breakups, I did kinda date him, and I didn't want bf to know because I knew he wouldn't like that, but he kept pushing to know more. 
I was tired of all this drama all the time, and I recognize I haven't been the best girlfriend, but I don't think I was that bad. I've always been here for him, I respected his time alone, I texted him every now and then, I stopped being jealous, I work so I pay for my stuff, I never asked him to buy me anything, I've been nurturing, caring, empathetic, and always made sure everyone knew I had a boyfriend, so no other guys would try anything with me.
he wasn't so bad either, he was very supportive, caring, sweet and he would always pick me up and take me back home. he carried my purse no matter how heavy it was, and tried to help me with my insecurities about my body and personality. 
most of my friends think he wasn't a good partner and I was too pretty for him, but I didn't care. I wanted us to work it out. 
I ended up leaving him on Saturday. I tried leaving him a couple of times before, and he promised he could help me feel better and wouldn't be a burden for me, but he always started fights about stupid stuff, and that just stressed me out even worse. 
I've been crying since Saturday. I know it's for the best; I'm not the best I can be right now, and he needed to understand and learn things, so hopefully, he'll be a better boyfriend next time.
I'm also very sure I'm not what he really wants, even if he says I am. I know he'd like a more introverted girl, who doesn't go out at night, doesn't drink or smoke weed, a girl without male friends and maybe less complicated or depressed. he swore that wasn't true, but I just know it. also, his mom would approve way more of a girl like that than me. 
idk, anyone has any advice?

I am so lost. I‚Äôm so confused and hurt. My heart is just broken. 
He sat me down last night, and held my hand. He told me that he doesn‚Äôt feel hopeful about our future anymore and that we are breaking up. I wanted to beg for him to stay.

My boyfriend and I broke up a month ago because we were arguing a lot and going through tough times individually. We decided to patch things up recently.

I obviously asked him about this and he got mad. He couldn‚Äôt believe that no one stuck up for him and that the accusations are false. I asked him so when I message her asking her why she‚Äôs lying and if she isn‚Äôt then to send proof, he got flustered, talked about suing for defamation and eventually asked ‚Äúare you really going to do that‚Äù.

I‚Äôd like to start by explaining how I know everyone involved ‚Äî I‚Äôll be using code names because I don‚Äôt want this to be seen by anyone mentioned.

I‚Äôm friends with C (m), but not that close ‚Äî our friendship mainly revolves around a mutual friend, N (m). About two months ago, C started dating E (f), and about two days ago they broke up (C ended things).

N told me that C never actually liked E, but agreed to date her because he felt too awkward to say no after she asked a third time. N also said that C has been cheating on E since within a week of them getting together.

For context, N isn‚Äôt friends with E, but he‚Äôs best friends with C. I‚Äôve already told I about all of this but asked her not to tell E, because I‚Äôm still unsure whether it would actually help or just make things worse.

1o6gk9e,I (F20) ended my relationship with my soulmate (M20). Did I make the wrong decision?,"
I F20 just broke up with my boyfriend M20. We‚Äôve been together for almost 2 years and are genuinely in love. I know you might think we‚Äôre so young etc but this really isn‚Äôt a naive first love thing. He‚Äôs the only person I‚Äôve ever actually wanted to be with and I‚Äôve had plenty of guy friends and sexual experiences to know what else is out there. I have never been so sexually attracted to someone in my life AND intellectually connected/ attracted. We really were perfect together and that‚Äôs what makes it so hard.

Lately i thought i had been feeling trapped. It started to wear me down as I‚Äôm in my last year at uni (a different one to him) and it feels like my last window of freedom before adult life starts. And I just want to live it fully without feeling held back. I told him that I needed space, and explained my feelings which he apologised for. I feel like I live with this deep resentment at the fact I met my soul mate so young.

I‚Äôm in my last year at uni (he goes to a diff one) and I started to feel quite trapped. He gets upset when I‚Äôm around other guys, even in completely normal situations. I want to be able to hang around guy friends without feeling guilty. And even though i genuinely do not want anyone else, i still yearn for a bit of freedom. Although said freedom is purely platonic, i know that it can break boundaries in relationships e.g. having sleepovers with my male friends after 5am events and etc. but i miss being free to do that. I fear that being in a forever relationship this young will inevitably make me grow resentment. I‚Äôm just not ready to be locked in for life at 20.

But equally, I realised I've grown up around constant arguments and not a singular positive relationship in my life or family. And tbh I think im labelling his actions as reasons why I feel ""trapped"" but honestly it's more a personal thing. I never ever ever thought I'd be in a relationship let alone a serious one where I wanted to marry the boy at this age. I just can't see myself possibly being happy being with someone that long (other than him) but it feels illegal to commit at 20. And I gave into that mindset.

I have full intentions of getting back with him but realised it will take me ages to be able to feel normal again, and then I won‚Äôt even be able to experience the freedom because I‚Äôm that time I‚Äôll be healing. And if I leave it too long what if he moves on? I can‚Äôt think of anything worse losing him makes me feel sick. I keep thinking maybe I just ruined the best thing that ever happened to me. I love him so much, but I want the freedom and space for the sake of US. I‚Äôm usually always so sure of myself but I just don‚Äôt know what to do anymore I don‚Äôt feel real.

TL;DR

I (F20) just broke up with my boyfriend (M20) of almost 2 years, even though we deeply love each other.  I started feeling trapped and I‚Äôm in my final year of uni and crave freedom and independence before adult life starts. He sometimes gets jealous when I‚Äôm around other guys, and is overprotective. This made me feel trapped/ guilty, but I know a lot of my feelings come from my own fear of commitment. I have so childhood trauma because my parents never got along and I have never seen a healthy relationship example in or around my family / life growing up. I still love my boyfriend so much and hope we get back together one day, but I also feel like I need space for my own growth. I‚Äôm so torn as I want freedom, but I don‚Äôt even know if I do anymore. I‚Äôm terrified I just ruined the best thing that‚Äôs ever happened to me.

1o6ggg2,I told my boyfriend's (now ex) mom about what he did to me and he blamed me for everything.,"Context:  

I've been dating (LDR) this guy for 2 years. I gave him everything I had and was the ""perfect"" gf as anyone would say. 

I had given him 604 letters, 604 reasons 50 poems, 2 animations, 40+ artworks. 2 why I loved him (6/04 his bday). 
I supported him in every step of his life..even if he failed college and switched course I stayed with him. I even travelled 150km just to give him gifts and hugs.

However, he manipulated me and never reciprocated the same energy. He started emotionally abusing me such as blaming me for all the problems in his life.. lusting and hiding things from me.. and even choosing his toxic friends over fixing our relationship. 

I had enough since he also sexually harassed me. So, I told his mom through messages but today he saw the messages I sent through on her phone before her. 

He then blamed me and told me he hated me so much, I'm the worst, he regrets being with me and how I betrayed him then proceeds to block me everywhere.

He ran away from accountability.
I sent his mom the whole story along with every evidence. Yet, he ran away and hid all his accounts just because he'd been caught sexually harassing minors.

Any advice on how I can move on from this? or maybe quotes that you'd tell someone after they leave an abusive relationship?

1o6ggcw,How can I (21M) trust that my ex (20M) has improved after no contact?,"Hi all, just looking for some outside perspective on this. Apologies for the long post, tl;dr at the end.

I (21M) met my ex partner (20M) a couple of years ago whilst I was at university (UK). We got on like a house on fire and things began unbelievably perfect. By about 6 months to a year in we began to have some really nasty arguments, mostly over miscommunications or him prioritising himself rather than trying to accommodate me. Stuff like we had different incomes, so instead of waiting for me to save up so we could do fun stuff together, he‚Äôd just go do it himself, then not make other plans with me. Or he‚Äôd make jokes about my friends that I found nasty, or we‚Äôd have different political views.

Our trip away for New Years was cut short because of an argument and we didn't properly speak for about a week after that. I found out that in that time, he had been talking to people on dating apps, so I cut things off with him, but after about a week (so not long at all) we reconciled. We kept dating for about 6 months, but obviously I had issues with trust and (admittedly) a bit of a short temper for his behaviour after so much disappointment. But we both still really cared about each other.

By the summer a lot of our problems started coming up again. We didn‚Äôt see each other as much, and he‚Äôd often get angry and lash out, saying things like he enjoyed other people‚Äôs company more than mine, and that he didn‚Äôt have any faith in long distance (I was about to graduate and move \~3 hours back home), and that because of all this he doesn‚Äôt see the point in trying. Obviously I entered full damage control mode, trying everything I could to be better and prove my worth but we ended up just fighting a lot. He‚Äôd hide a lot of what he did, like who he was seeing at the weekends or what he did on nights out etc, and eventually admitted he didn‚Äôt feel the same about me anymore despite the countless paragraphs I‚Äôd text him.

I moved back home, but in July we had a week-long camping trip planned, so I convinced him to still do that together, to prove that things together wouldn‚Äôt be so bad. He reluctantly did and we had some nice moments, but I argued and yelled at him a lot over the fact that I couldn‚Äôt trust him and it felt like he wasn‚Äôt trying. We came home, and I found out through someone else that he‚Äôd been cheating on me for about a year. I only saw virtual proof, like explicit photos and messages, but it had been happening routinely for genuinely months (and obviously with how things had been, I didn‚Äôt believe him saying that nothing ever happened in person). I blew up, and we broke up officially after he made no effort to care.

We went no contact for a few months. For about the last month and a half, he has been trying to get back in contact with me, sending me messages on socials or ringing my number to leave voicemails (I‚Äôve had him blocked on everything thought the entire time). Over summer I‚Äôve taken the time to process things in my own head and although I still feel upset about things, I did feel in a much better place (aka not crying everyday)! Eventually he sent me a very long, heartfelt letter through the post, where he specifically admitted how things were his fault, how he misses me, and that he‚Äôs taken a lot of time to grow and make self-improvement now he‚Äôs started his new degree & is committed to proving that to me. Whilst I doubted how genuine it was, it did read sincere, and my family agreed that if he did mean his words it would be cruel not to reply back. So I did, and ended up driving to visit him this weekend.¬†

We had a nice time together, and although my ex is very much the same person, I did see the effort he was making and he seemed so happy to see me. He‚Äôs promised all sorts, such as to limit contact with people that he isn't particularly close with and to have life360 on etc, as he doesn‚Äôt want to give me any reason to worry anymore. We kept talking, and details of what he did over the summer began to come out in trickles. At first he was quite vague, saying he didn‚Äôt sleep with people like I was making out, but I ended up learning that he had started seeing somebody else (M20) over the summer (I‚Äôll call him M). He claimed things were never that serious besides things like dinner together, but after more pushing from me he admitted that yes they were physically intimate, saw each other lots, and even went on holiday together for a week.

I feel guilty for being upset over all that, because after we broke up I also started talking to other people and went on my own share of failed dates, but never anything as serious as what he described, and after some time I did delete all my dating apps to focus on myself & my real friends, as I realised I was only trying to move on out of spite and because I felt lonely after moving back home. Eventually I asked one of my other friends to talk to the rebound M, who confirmed that yes they were something serious: that he started dating my ex from about June to September, and that my ex admitted to his friends that he‚Äôd ‚Äúnever been happier‚Äù, but things ended on bad terms when my ex apparently slept with someone else, and (surprise) M found out about me!, and that despite how things ended my ex was still trying to contact me!

I brought all of this up, and my ex got quite emotional. He admitted that he minimised things when I asked because he didn‚Äôt want to further upset me. He said it was only a distraction for him, and that he didn‚Äôt see it as seriously as M did (who on the other hand admitted to my ex that he loved him, and was happy parading him around as a boyfriend). He insisted that they were not properly talking for as long as M made out, and vehemently denied being physical with anybody else in all of that time besides M (... despite the messages I‚Äôve seen from multiple other people of my ex asking to meet up again). He said it became scary a few weeks in since he realised there was no real feelings or connection, besides it being a distraction to how heartbroken he was. He was happy when it was over and understands that its hard for me to accept his life went on without me in a sense, and that he doesn‚Äôt hold any of my feelings about it against me (and although he regrets it, he says it helped him grow and put what me & him had into perspective).¬†

When I was angry about this, through his tears he admitted that he feels awful as he feels like he‚Äôs really losing me. He‚Äôs gone on a lot about all the qualities I have, and that nobody else brings him happiness as effortlessly as I do. Obviously I want to believe in him and that he wants to be better, but I‚Äôm hurt that all of this happened so quickly (and in particular how his antics began whilst I was still in the picture - at a time when I was really trying to have faith in our relationship, but he had given up.) He admitted that he tried to move on so quick as he was angry at how things ended between us, and that he genuinely didn‚Äôt see me talking to him again or us reconciling. When I saw him this weekend, although I had a good time, my mind kept wandering to everything he‚Äôd done without me and all of the stuff he is probably still hiding. We had sex (which was probably a bad idea) and I just kept imagining like I was M. Not fun.

I just don‚Äôt know what to trust, since he claimed to have taken months to ‚Äúimprove himself‚Äù, when in reality it has not been that long at all. In a way I‚Äôm both upset that he got his wish to ‚Äútry it on‚Äù with someone else (even if he then realised it wasn't for him, and has claimed multiple times that he only ever wants me), whilst in another way I‚Äôm jealous that I‚Äôve not taken that same opportunity.

Now he‚Äôs giving me space, but is upset at the fact that I‚Äôm more fixated on the past then the future, and wants to see me/talk to me more to prove that we should get back together. But the past is all I have to go on right now, and although these things happened months ago for him, it‚Äôs all fresh wounds for me. Talking to him hurts: I keep flip-flopping between feeling sad, angry, and wanting to just ignore it all and move on.¬†

I know it sounds like the obvious answer is to just cut contact again, but I think we do have an extremely strong bond in many ways, and although there‚Äôs been bad in our relationship there‚Äôs also been a lot of good that I haven‚Äôt described here. He was genuinely a huge part of my life and my best friend - we did so much together and made so many memories. I can‚Äôt imagine myself with somebody else and not comparing them to my ex, but it just feels like he‚Äôs still being immature, and I don‚Äôt want to feel like somebody‚Äôs second choice - I want to feel consistently appreciated from the beginning of the relationship. Not someone who you have to lose to realise how good they actually are.

I feel like only time can help me heal, and I worry that I only miss him so much because I‚Äôve finished uni, moved home, quit my job, and am far from my friends etc. And he‚Äôs the one bit of stability from my old life. I‚Äôm not even sure how things would work between us now, since we live further apart now, and I‚Äôm a bit lost in my professional life (and part of me wants to move out ASAP), whilst he‚Äôs starting his new course that will last a couple of years.

I just wish things never even turned out this way! And I keep wondering where I went wrong. How can I trust that he really can be better, and try to heal our relationship?

  


**tl;dr:** broke up with my ex after issues with trust & infidelity. we went no contact for a few months, and he started seeing someone else, but broke things off because he only wanted me. now he wants to reconcile, understands how he failed as a boyfriend, and is committed to self-improvement and healing our relationship. but i still don't know if i can trust him, and when we hang out i struggle to forgive how he was in the past, or forget about what i've learned he‚Äôs done whilst we weren‚Äôt together.",VeronalPasta,1760450751.0,1,0.99,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o6ggcw/how_can_i_21m_trust_that_my_ex_20m_has_improved/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o6ggcw/how_can_i_21m_trust_that_my_ex_20m_has_improved/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False

1o6gbir,"Situationship Breakup, do they ever come back if their reason was about their circumstances right now?","So I have been talking to this guy for about a week and a half, and things were going well to the point where there were these two intense nights that we were just talking and hanging out until rly late, cuddling and making out etc. It felt like a fever dream honestly, bc I really liked this guy. FYI we went to the same highschool but never talked to each other before, and then now in college he started talking to me and showed interest for the first time. And I did set my boundaries from the start as I told him that I dont do hook ups and I dont want to be involved in a weird stage where all we do is make out and cuddle. And that was two days ago, where he told me that he will put that in mind.

And last night, he ended things with me saying that he just doesnt have time for anything even casual with anyone, and that he still likes me but he just ""cant"" hang out. He wish he can, but he said he needs to commit to his schoolwork and sports (he is an athlete) and prioritize those two. He repeatedly told me that this wasnt anything personal, and that he can promise me that it wouldve been the same with anyone else. He also told me that when he says that he is locking in, it means that there are no girls in general period. He did wish that things were a bit different and college was easier than he thought so that he can have fun. He also told me that he still wants to talk to me occasionally, if that means grabbing a coffee or seeing each other during his frat party etc (which he also doesnt like that much of). 

I trust him with saying that he is struggling to be better in both of his sports and academics, since he did seem very deep in thought regarding grades and his future career etc, and that he is not a type of person who would be playing two girls. But it just feels like he is scared of failing or that there was a big factor (like his coach or his parents) who made him realize that he is not in a good spot recently, because it was just fine until today. 

Will that change at all when he starts to get into a routine and rhythm?

1o6fy8o,I want him back,"My bf of 5.5 years and I broke up last month. It was a strange situation where the last 9 months of the  relationship he would express he was unhappy, have angry outbursts (never physical), broke my trust repeatedly, and he even tried breaking up with me twice only to change his mind in the morning. We tried counseling, I tried giving him space, tried the opposite and doing more date nights, nothing worked and in the end I ended up initiating the breakup because I knew he wasn't happy and he didn't want to feel like the bad guy for leaving me. This past month has been the worst month of my life. I now come home every night to an empty home, I miss taking to him, and seeing his name light up my phone. I never wanted the relationship to end, I just thought of it as a rough patch we'd get over. Sure we had a rough couple of months, and I know I wasn't perfect, but the rest of the relationship was so good. Well all this to say, he broke no contact with me a couple of days ago, wanting to check in and see how I'm doing. He isn't doing well and neither am I, but he still says he doesn't want to be together, that he thinks he was a bad bf and we could both be happier. He said he wants to stay in touch and I want to reconnect but I don't want to chase him into a relationship if he isn't ready and doesn't think it would work out. I also think it would be very hard for me to try talking to him only as friends when I'm still in love with him. He ended up ending the conversation with my by saying he loves me.

We broke up in 2023 after 3 years together. He went down the rabbit hole of re-adding exes, trying to date new women, and filling the void with anything but healing properly and self-reflection. After 3 months, he failed and begged for me back. I had him blocked everywhere, but he got to my work laptop‚Äôs imessage. He promised to be better and not take me for granted. I was ‚Äúthe one‚Äù he said. He didn‚Äôt care what anyone says he said. He wanted to do better for me, he said.

I wasted another 2 years of my life from empty promises, lack of reciprocation and efforts. He constantly joked about being a house husband and me being his sugar mama. Mind you, I‚Äôm 4 years younger than him. All he ever prioritized was his social life, entertainment, and cheap dopamine highs. He always lied about being sick/do something shady to skip work or work from home just to play video games (he used my positive covid test so he can skip a week from the office). He always had wandering eyes and loved attention from new women. He‚Äôs still way too dependent on his parents for basic adult to-dos. We lived together and I carried the load of two people mentally and physically. We broke up almost three weeks ago and he‚Äôs back to his same patterns post breakup.

This time around, my doors are permanently closed for him. People don‚Äôt change or even improve tbh. They go for a few months ‚Äúacting‚Äù  then go back to their old ways. I accepted him for who he was, flaws and all but all he did was TAKE. No matter how much you two love each other, share interests, or have great chemistry, some people are just too self-centered for their own damn good and will drain the life out of their partner. He‚Äôs so charming and good with friendships, but he was a terrible partner.

Lately I am not in a right state of mind physically and mentally. And it is making me miss him more , everything reminds me of him . I miss loving him , I miss his jokes , his laugh the endless nights we spent talking and cuddling.  Those days were beautiful . 

It didn‚Äôt last long. 

The way he treated me in the last few months of our relationship was worst. He made it clear that he would never marry me or go against his family. He started seeing other girls and used to talk about them even though he knew how much it‚Äôs hurting me. And the worst he had developed some fetish of me flirting with other men. He wanted me to send explicit pics to other men. But he still claimed to love me. 
He used to tell me that he will continue talking to me till the day he gets married with someone else.   
I used to beg him to stop all this and try to go back the way we were. 
But there was a day when I found his lies about his identity. I lost it and blocked him. 
He also left and never tried to contact me.    

All these disrespect to my emotions is still affecting me mentally.   
Everytime I think of him I realise how much I was in love with him but for him I was an option. 

I hope this feeling of missing him will stop one day.

1o6fvit,How I Navigated a Long-Term Friendship That Turned Toxic Over the Years,"I met this friend in middle school. Back then, everyone else around me seemed even more toxic ‚Äî more judgmental, competitive, or mean-spirited ‚Äî and she was the only one willing to spend time with me. At first, I stayed close because I felt I had no other companions. But even in those early years, she was far from a healthy friend. She was moody, unpredictable, and showed jealousy on numerous occasions. Small things would trigger her anger: borrowing a compass during geometry class, waiting for her turn to use paints in art class, or simply me focusing on my own work.

She also spread lies about my other best friend, claiming she had overheard gossip or that mutual friends were mocking me behind my back. She never did any of her assignments on her own and would constantly call me and other classmates to copy answers, sometimes disrupting my schedule. She even passed disrespectful comments about my parents. Despite all this, she would cling to me when I started distancing myself, acting emotional and trying to hoover me back into her orbit. Even then, I could see the early signs of manipulation, though there were moments of genuine fun and connection that made it difficult to fully let go.

Through high school and college, she seemed to ‚Äúchange‚Äù ‚Äî at least on the surface. She became more pleasant and cooperative, and I assumed that her behavior had improved. We were close again ‚Äî vibing, chatting frequently, meeting, and enjoying hangouts before the pandemic. The spark between us reignited; our friendship seemed genuine and it seemed like things were healing and we're Best Friends Forever.

‚ÄãHowever, subtle signs of jealousy and insecurity persisted. She questioned my achievements, mocked my busy schedule, and hesitated to invite me to hangouts. Looking back, I realize now that these were early indicators of control and envy disguised as friendship.

During her master‚Äôs program, she became socially isolated and didn‚Äôt form new friendships. The spark in our friendship that had persisted through middle school, high school, and college began to diminish. Soon after, she faced a series of major setbacks: first, career loss as she lost a job nor could get selected in any job interview and she's still unemployed, and then she went through breakup with her then boyfriend a few months later after already going through many ups and downs with him and she was facing health issues which led to her abrupt weight gain and insecurities regarding her looks that she stopped posting on social media though she's very active on social media. Even when she was employed then in Mumbai she herself confessed to me that her boss a‚Äãnd company manager were most strict and ruthless with her as compared to her other colleagues. When she was staying in PG in Mumbai, her PG landlady and her roommates would be cladhing with her only. At the same time, she lost her closest and longest friend whom she was in contact with for almost 2 decades. ‚ÄãThese events seemed to trigger a dramatic change ‚Äî she became cold, avoidant, and emotionally detached, shedding the pretense of being a ‚Äúgood friend‚Äù entirely. The person who used to beg to be understood or seek validation during fights was gone. What remained was someone numb, avoidant, and hardened ‚Äî yet still manipulative underneath.

One day, on her birthday, I posted a heartfelt WhatsApp status for her ‚Äî but she didn‚Äôt reply. I assumed she was busy. Later, she claimed she couldn‚Äôt see it. I sent a screenshot as proof, and she was relieved, even appreciative. Everything seemed fine ‚Äî until my birthday came.

She didn‚Äôt wish me ‚Äî and instead accused me of never wishing her. I was stunned. After all my efforts, she flipped the script on me. This was the first crack that showed her hypocrisy.

A few months later, her breadcrumbing started. She grew distant, aloof, and cold ‚Äî replying late, acting indifferent, and withholding warmth. When I confronted her about her behavior, she abruptly blocked me.

I blocked her back in anger. Months later, she tried to reconcile ‚Äî apologizing vaguely ‚Äî and I gave her a second chance, thinking maybe she had reflected. But soon after, she began breadcrumbing again.

Even after I had sent her expensive perfume on her birthday as a gesture of goodwill and revival, she didn‚Äôt reciprocate. No gifts, no effort. Then when I finally blocked her again ‚Äî she, for the first time, blocked me back remorselessly. No apology, no guilt, no attempt at reconciliation. That was the final nail in the coffin. I sent an anonymous message expressing my frustration, exposing her manipulative tendencies, and sharing screenshot evidence of triangulation and gossiping with mutual friends to protect them.

Now, she stands where she placed herself ‚Äî alone, disconnected, and exposed. She lost her career, her relationship, her credibility, and her old manipulative grip on others.

Even now, I sometimes reminisce about the good moments ‚Äî our hangouts before the pandemic, the hours spent chatting online, and the feeling of connection that existed in the early years.

1o6fujd,How do you get over someone who treated you well and you truly saw a future with but the relationship was very short lived?,"26F me and the guy I was dating for only three months broke things off almost a month ago, since then I have been a mess. First week was horrible, I had to go back to my parents because I was extremely depressed, barely ate anything for two weeks straight, spent days crying. Second week was shit but I went back to work and my duties. Then around week 3 things started looking up again, I started eating, socializing again, started therapy, journaling, going back to my hobbies. My friends, family and even coworkers were very supportive and I truly felt the much needed warmth. Well, week 4 and it's looking bad again, I have no will to live. I wake up each morning with an empty feeling in my chest, I struggle with sleeping and performing normal tasks, I stopped socializing again. I know it's too early to judge, but my second therapy session was quite bad, my next one is tomorrow and I am already having a bad feeling about it.¬†I tear up at work whenever I remember things he did or things he said to me, and the switch up makes me go completely insane. It's like it was never genuine.¬†
For context, I've always been pretty sheltered, and I constantly have my guard up due to horrible life experiences, in a way this was my wake up call because I realized that I need to work on it in therapy. I had never received any affection or love growing up. Not even from my parents (abusive). This man treated me great, had all of the features I had¬†always wanted in a partner, was loving and affectionate. I disclosed a lot of information about my past, and he reassured me through words and actions. I truly believe my life was improved when I met him. I lived some of the best months of my life that I am really grateful for. Due to my life experiences, I did not have much of a romantic life until I started living alone a couple years ago, so what I am currently learning, I should have learned 10 years ago. Which makes me go even more insane, because it feels like I am not enough. I am practically reacting like a teenager getting her heart broken for the first time. Except I am 26 and I have work tomorrow. And rent to pay. I am grateful that I got to experience this ""relationship"" (although it was short), but it really feels like this was my last shot at love, due to my age and life circumstances. It feels like I truly lost the only person that has ever shown me love and appreciation. I feel completely unlovable now, and I am unable to keep a positive outlook on the future.¬†

I have absolutely no idea how to deal with the suffering. I try to get out of the house as much as I can, but I am seriously so depressed, I can't help but isolate from my friends and family and spend my time crying or ruminating. Journaling is definitely helping, but I cannot bring myself to write how I am feeling when I am so depressed.

1o6fsgs,"Found out my ex of 6 years was cheating the entire relationship and I'm not even the other woman, I'm the side chick","I dont even know how to process this. Im sitting here in shock just staring at my phone.

My boyfriend - ex boyfriend now I guess - and I were together for 6 years. We met in college, moved in together after graduation, talked about marriage and kids. I thought we were building a life together.

Last night he told me he needed space. Said he was feeling overwhelmed with work and needed time to figure things out. I was confused because everything seemed fine but I said okay, take the time you need.

This morning I got a message on Instagram from a woman I've never met.

She said ""I dont know how to tell you this but I think you should know. \[His name\] is my husband. We've been married for 4 years.""

I thought it was a joke or a scam or something. I responded asking what she was talking about.

She sent me photos. Wedding photos. Of my boyfriend marrying this woman. The date on them? Two years into our relationship.

She sent me more stuff. Photos of them together. Screenshots of texts. Their marriage certificate. Photos of their house - a house I've never seen before. She said they have a 2 year old daughter together.

A daughter.

I called him immediately. He didnt answer. I called 15 times. Finally he picked up.

Me: ""Are you married?""

Silence.

Me: ""Are you MARRIED? Do you have a wife? A kid?""

Him: ""I can explain.""

I lost it. Started screaming. He tried to talk over me saying it's complicated and he never meant for this to happen.

Apparently hes been living a double life. He told her he travels for work. Told me he visits his sick mom in another state every other week. Neither was true. He was just going back and forth between us.

The days he said he was traveling for work? He was with her. The weekends he said his mom needed help? He was with his wife and kid.

Every holiday we ""compromised"" on seeing each other's families separately? He was with them.

I've been the side chick for 6 years and didnt even know it.

His wife found out because he left his other phone at their house and she went through it. Saw all our texts, photos, everything. She confronted him yesterday which is why he suddenly needed ""space.""

He tried to tell me he loves both of us. That he didnt know how to choose. That he got trapped in the lie and couldnt find a way out.

I hung up on him and threw up. Literally threw up.

6 years. 6 YEARS of my life. I was planning a future with this person. I thought I knew him. I thought we were solid.

His wife messaged me again. She said she had no idea about me either until yesterday. She thought they had a normal marriage. She's filing for divorce.

She asked if we could talk. I dont even know what to say to her. Were both victims here but also how do you have a conversation with the wife of the man youve been accidentally sleeping with for 6 years?

I feel so stupid. How did I not see this? How did I not question anything?

He had a whole separate life. A whole separate family. And I was just... what? The side piece he kept around for convenience?

My best friend came over when I told her. Shes been here for 3 hours just letting me cry. She said theres no way I could have known, that hes a sociopath, that this isnt my fault.

But I keep thinking about all the signs I must have missed. The times he was unavailable. The vague answers. The separate finances. How he never wanted to post about us on social media.

I thought he was just private. Turns out he was just hiding me.

6 years.

I dont even know who I am anymore. Everything I thought was real was a lie. Every memory is tainted. Every plan we made was built on nothing

And theres a kid. A 2 year old who exists because while I thought we were building a life together, he was building a completely different life with someone else.

I feel like my entire reality just shattered.

1o6fkn4,Is this a reason to end things?,"Me and my boyfriend are having ongoing issues we‚Äôre long distance and maintaining a connection with time difference and schedules is hard. There is also another issue with his family. 

On my side I‚Äôm emotionally unmet, I don‚Äôt feel special there‚Äôs nothing romantic going on. I have to ask for affection and to connect. For example we have a long distance app for couples and I find I‚Äôm answering the prompts only and then I have to ask multiple times for him to answer it back. I also recently lost a relative and when it happened my partner went MIA for the night not responding and then pretended that he fell asleep. I found out through activity status he was lying. Since that incident he still hasn‚Äôt kept in touch with my grief or asking if I‚Äôm okay. It‚Äôs just overall the feeling of being alone when factually I‚Äôm not. With being romantic there‚Äôs no flowers or expression of love and that‚Äôs something I‚Äôve told him is important again and again. With meeting again during long distance it‚Äôs quite wishy washy he says ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know when I can take the time off yet‚Äù etc etc. he works a 9-5 like most sometimes having to do over time but I do feel his busyness is over exaggerated to make a point and I can‚Äôt stand it. 

On his side he feels I have not made the greatest effort with his family. I stayed with them for a few months before we went long distant. I come from a reserved family with a troubled upbringing his family is picture perfect, always together, all eat around the table type. So when I stayed I felt it hard to converse with his family and relate/get to know them. I still tried I went out with his sisters and his mother to do groceries etc I also made the effort to keep in touch even after my stay through messaging which his sister ended up ignoring my message. I bought his mother a birthday present which wasn‚Äôt cheap. I just don‚Äôt know where the ‚Äúlack of effort‚Äù is coming from other than I was more reserved and less like the family he‚Äôs came from and it showed outwardly to everyone. I was even criticised for beginning to touch my plate before everyone else had etc etc. Which in retrospect after it was explained to me how it‚Äôs disrespectful i understand, but I didn‚Äôt have the same morals taught to me because I haven‚Äôt even really sat at the dinner table with my own family, it‚Äôs just not a thing we‚Äôve done. 
And that‚Äôs the issue is I‚Äôm not unwilling to learn but I wasn‚Äôt understood from the other side I was just automatically judged and still am. 

I want to end things so he can find someone who comes from a similar background where something so fundamental isn‚Äôt an issue and I would like to be with someone who cares when I‚Äôm griefing and cares about maintaining a connection with me romantically. I spoke to him and he said ‚Äúhe won‚Äôt give up that easily‚Äù but at the same time things stay stagnant and there isn‚Äôt exactly any change. 

Has anyone had a similar situation? I‚Äôm still young and I don‚Äôt want to make the mistake of the grass is greener because I love him a lot. At the same time I don‚Äôt think he does as it shows through his actions or lack of. I also don‚Äôt know if the family situation will ever get better I feel like I‚Äôll never be enough in my efforts.",Beautiful-Potato-142,1760448636.0,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o6fkn4/is_this_a_reason_to_end_things/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o6fkn4/is_this_a_reason_to_end_things/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o6ffss,"F/20 and M/21 - In a 2 year long distance relationship, I think i want to break up","I (F/20) have been in a long-distance relationship with my boyfriend (M/21) for 2 years and 2 months. I care about him deeply, but I‚Äôve been unhappy for a long time and I keep wondering if it‚Äôs finally time to end things.

There are so many reasons I feel this way: he‚Äôs never given me flowers, never posted me on his main Instagram (only on his spam account), likes pictures of other girls, and refuses to delete them even when I express that it bothers me.

During arguments, he always makes himself the victim. Nothing ever gets resolved ‚Äî he just acts like everything is fine the next day. He doesn‚Äôt like when I talk to my friends for advice, or when I mention our relationship to my family. Meanwhile, he avoids letting anyone in his family (other members not his mom dad and etc)even know about me.

He follows ‚ÄúHoodville‚Äù on Instagram, and the things he likes there honestly make me question who he really is. When I cry, he doesn‚Äôt comfort me. It feels like everything I do annoys him. I feel like I constantly have to walk on eggshells ‚Äî watching what I say or how I act so I don‚Äôt upset him.

At this point, I feel like I‚Äôm dating a child. His parents and siblings like me, but I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that he‚Äôs just using me for sex. We‚Äôre each other‚Äôs first real relationship, but I‚Äôm emotionally drained and no longer feel appreciated.

1o6f8v0,"He (M31) said he couldn‚Äôt do long distance again, but he tried for me (F30). And that‚Äôs what makes this heartbreak even harder.","This is going to be a long story. 

I (30F) was seeing a man (31M) for about 6 months.

We met years ago in Brussels, where we had an awesome date that lasted 6 - 7 hours. We were supposed to meet again for a second date but someone stole my phone and I had to go back to my country because my student visa came to an end and I had graduated. It was one of the best dates I've ever had. Everything was flowing and natural.

2 years have passed, we lost touch, and he randomly found me as a friend suggestion on Facebook. He messaged me on Messenger asking about me. We started talking a bit more here and there on Whatsapp sporadically sharing messages. He lives in France and me in Morocco.

We reconnected this year. We spent 3 magical days together in Nice in May and later 5 days in June in Paris. It wasn‚Äôt just attraction, it was alignment. We laughed, talked for hours, shared values, emotional depth, and an ease I‚Äôve never experienced before. It felt like we recognized each other.

From the very beginning, he told me he had sworn never to do long-distance again. He‚Äôd had one in the past that ended painfully, and he said it almost broke him. Before he met me he was single for 6 years. He's only had one and serious relationship. They met when he was on exchange and decided to go for an LDR, it lasted 3 years, and while it was beautiful, it was frustrating for him, they had no idea on the future, they'd only meet every 3 months, they didn't really know how to tackle their problems and she broke up with him on Valentines Day. He got over her but the experience scarred him. The next experience scarred him as well because after his break up he tried to do casual with a woman who was really into him. He tried to end it but she would unleash her anger on him by sending really long paragraphs and he couldnt really avoid it as she was kind of his boss ( he was 21 back then and her 30). And when he tried the apps, he'd get ghosted or not have much luck. His job is hectic anyways. Anyways. He kind of became wary of women which I understand. He's such a gentle, kind and understanding, empathetic soul. 

But he also said that I was the exception to his rule, that what he felt with me was different, that it was worth trying again. He‚Äôs the one who asked to make our relationship exclusive. He‚Äôs the one who said he wanted to build something serious, in our own rhythm. He told me I gave him hope in women again.

He even asked to meet my best friend ( which he did ), and I met two of his closest friends in Paris. We were building something quietly but genuinely. We had already planned our third stay together, 11 days in Paris this September. Everything felt steady. I didn‚Äôt suspect anything.

Then, about 15 days before our next trip, he called me. He sounded tense. He told me he‚Äôd been struggling for weeks, maybe a month and a half, trying to make sense of his feelings. That he felt his ‚Äúromantic momentum‚Äù fade away, that the distance had slowly drained his ability to project himself in the relationship.

He said it wasn‚Äôt about me, that I was exceptional, emotionally mature, kind, honest, safe, but that he couldn‚Äôt bear the emotional gap anymore. He works long hours (9am to 8pm), barely rests, and said he simply didn‚Äôt have the energy for the frustration that distance brings. He told me his doubt began growing a month beforehand and he didn't wanna say anything to me out of fear or ruining what we had and instilling doubt and tension in my mind. He was mumbling, tripping over his words, repeating himself. What's crazy is that he ended things 15 days before we were supposed to meet. 

We planned and picked our dates and everything. He told everyone about me.. his colleagues, his friends, his mom..

It took him three video calls to end things. The first call, he was anxious, emotional, hesitant. I barely spoke, I was in shock. I just told him I understood his decision. I was very calm and understanding. I couldn't process what was happening. He then told me that if I needed to talk more about it, I should reach out to him. At first, I thought he was being polite. But then he repeated it at the end of the call. I took as a hint. The next day I reached out to him saying that I still needed to tell him some things.

The second call, he confessed to me that he felt a big emptiness after the first call and that he was so happy I reached out to him. He even told me that he wondered if he made the right decision but that he realized that it was the right thing to do. I told him how he should have told me about it beforehand.  I‚Äôd written him a letter and asked if I could read it. I told him I still believed in what we had, that I felt safe and at peace with him, that I wasn‚Äôt ready to give up something so rare. He listened quietly, visibly moved, and said my words touched him deeply. He admitted that he still wanted us to meet in September and that he just needed a bit of time to think before making his decision.

Two days later, the the third call‚Ä¶ that one broke me. His decision hadn‚Äôt changed. It lasted a long time. He told me I was ‚Äúrare in an ocean of normality,‚Äù that I‚Äôd reminded him that good, honest people exist, that he had never experienced something like this before. That I really understood him in all ways and kept telling how unique our relationship and I was. He told me he admired my strength, my empathy, and that I‚Äôd go far in life.

After that call he sent me a letter that night saying my message that I was a safe space, that I‚Äôd restored his faith in both women and humanity. 

And then, silence.

It‚Äôs been 24 days. I haven‚Äôt contacted him, and he hasn‚Äôt contacted me. I refused his offer of staying ‚Äúfriends.‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt do it, not after everything we shared.

I miss him every day. I know he didn‚Äôt lie, I know he cared, but I think he just reached his emotional limit. Still, I can‚Äôt stop wondering if he feels the void too. Because I do, constantly. I think about him when I wake up, before I sleep, in between work meetings, when I cook, when I pray. He‚Äôs everywhere.

The worst part is, this wasn‚Äôt a toxic story. It was healthy, tender, funny, respectful. It ended because of life, not because of betrayal or conflict. And somehow that makes it even harder. 

I know that he really did give it his all. I know he struggles with anxiety and burn out because of his job. He really did try with everything he could. And I hate to admit it, but he made the right choice. Our relationship wouldn't have lasted. Not like this.

The worst part in all of this is that living in Paris has always been my dream way long before reconnecting with him. I had travelled there 5 times before seeing him again. But I never told him about my dream to go and live there. Because it was my dream. And if I make it there, it's because of my ambition, and not out of romance. It wouldn't have changed anything if I told him because who knows when I'll make it.

Anyways, that was my story.

1o6f81e,We were perfect until he said we ‚Äòweren‚Äôt right for each other.‚Äô I don‚Äôt know if I can do this anymore.,"Sweet lord that title is painfully cliche. I hope I‚Äôm posting this in the right place because I‚Äôve literally never posted before, only browsed and watched those Minecraft Reddit TikToks lol. I could really use some answers right now (I don‚Äôt deserve any pity or empathy in my opinion). But yeah‚Äîonto my issue.

So I (17F) dated my ex (16M) for about five months, from March to July. Right before we got together, my life was literal chaos ‚Äî AP exams, teachers being evil, grades tanking, tech week for my school concert, family loss, just everything all at once. Then he came into my life, and I don‚Äôt know how else to describe it other than real love.

I‚Äôd known of him for a while since he was in my art class, but we never really talked until he confessed to me in the middle of March. We started talking after that and basically never stopped. Hours and hours every day, always together at school ‚Äî he just made life feel peaceful again. I‚Äôm usually the ‚Äútherapist‚Äù friend and not really the type to date casually (I‚Äôm Christian, and I only wanted something serious), and he was too, which is super rare at my school.

He was honestly one of the best people I‚Äôve ever met. Kind, thoughtful, patient, always respecting my boundaries, writing little things for me, surprising me ‚Äî just overall such a green flag (and I‚Äôm really picky with using that word lol).

Over the summer, we had to do long distance because of my mom‚Äôs rules, so we only saw each other once. We still texted and FaceTimed all the time though. Then, near the end of summer, he suddenly said he needed ‚Äúa day to think about some things.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt think much of it since I‚Äôve done that myself before ‚Äî just needing a quiet day. But later, he told me there were personal things going on (which I won‚Äôt go into because I want to keep his privacy), and that because of that, he thought ‚Äúwe weren‚Äôt right for each other.‚Äù

And then he said the words: ‚ÄúYou could do better.‚Äù

That crushed me. Because in my eyes, he was the better one. He was everything.

Now school‚Äôs back, and we‚Äôre in the same art class again. Same workroom, even in the same group sometimes. But it‚Äôs like we don‚Äôt even know each other anymore. I tried to act okay, but it hurts every time I see him. He tried reaching out once in August, but I shut it down because I didn‚Äôt know how to talk to him without breaking down.

I just don‚Äôt understand what happened. We weren‚Äôt having problems (at least not that I could see). He always said my support helped him and that things were getting better, but then he just left.

Im scared. Im scared and confused and hurt, and i dont want to get flagged but i tried something more then once (and failed obviously). Therapy failed me even before i met him. I could‚Äôve promised to God I was the best girlfriend i could be, but not I feel like I hurt him in some way or missed a sign. I‚Äôm so sad and I don‚Äôt want to do the thing again because my parents will be hurt and I know deep down there‚Äôs always gonna be someone who cares about me.

1o6f18i,Did I do the right thing ending it? or should I have stuck with the stonewalling?,"I'm a 29-year-old man who's just ended a 4-month relationship with my ex-girlfriend, a 25-year-old woman working in investment banking. We met through mutual friends in NYC and hit it off immediately‚Äîshared laughs, deep conversations, and I went all-in with weekly gifts, daily check-ins, fancy dinners, a Hamptons family vacation, and introducing her to my homes and circle. The first three months were honeymoon bliss with no real arguments, but after that, her brutal work hours seemed to trigger emotional whiplash over small things, like my behaviors or minor inconveniences.

The trouble started after a fun DC trip I planned and paid for (Giants vs. Commanders game with friends‚Äîher idea). A group pic from the weekend got posted on IG (I shared it, she did too), but on the flight home, she turned ice-cold. Back in NYC, she ghosted me for five days‚Äîno texts, no reels, nothing. When we finally met for dinner, she accused me of hiding a ""secret identity/life"" based on a paranoid Google/FB dive that uncovered a silly 7th-grade ""marriage"" joke on my profile. I explained everything openly (I've been fully transparent with family, friends, and my life), but it led to an all-night argument and ruined plans.

From there, it snowballed: She demanded a week-long ""break,"" followed by sporadic cold interactions, one-word answers, and dismissing my work talk while she was stressed. I suggested ways to rebuild trust, like a couples dinner, but she shut it down. Two weeks in, exhausted from chasing, I agreed to her ""reevaluation"" space. Then came my best friend's 30th birthday lake house trip (pre-planned, non-negotiable as I'm best man at his wedding). She asked me to skip it for an old couples trip idea I'd already said no to multiple times; I went, and she gave zero check-ins, just crumbs in response to mine.

We met after to ""talk,"" where she accused me of not prioritizing her. I called out the maddening double standard‚Äîher ghosting for days, weaponizing silence as ""space"" (which felt like punishment), admitting texting was a chore, and expecting mind-reading‚Äîwhile I followed her rules for minimal contact. She doubled down with two more weeks of near-silence, only one weekly text from me for a dinner plan. We pushed through for my parents' charity gala (they adore her), where she was warm to everyone but silent with me afterward, even over an Uber bill I offered to cover.

The final straw: I planned a thoughtful dinner at Cipriani Soho with drinks, texting details as she preferred. Her response was a rant about roles, accusing me of not fulfilling a ""traditional M/F dynamic"" (something we'd never discussed), saying she'd been handling ""boyfriend duties"" like paying bills and emotions (despite me covering nearly everything), and implying I was financially struggling. After a month of this emotional torture‚Äîstonewalling over an IG repost, nonexistent secrets, and petty bills‚ÄîI ended it, saying the silence made fighting for us impossible. She replied ""shocked and saddened.""

The outcome I want is clarity: Did I overreact by bailing after four months, or was her pattern of stonewalling a legit red flag I dodged? Either way, I want to know how to spot and handle this better in future relationships so I don't waste energy on unbalanced dynamics.

**TL;DR**¬†29M ended 4-month relationship with 25F after honeymoon phase turned into a month of her stonewalling/ghosting over petty triggers (IG pic paranoia, Uber bill) while expecting me to chase and prioritize unilaterally.

1o6ea98,He broke up and i‚Äôm losing my mind,"The love of my life said he couldn‚Äôt deal with my constant unhapiness anymore. I know I fucked it up by letting my depression and fear of the future reflect on our relationship, but I loved him deeply, i took care of him, i accepted him, he had his flaws, it was difficult to talk to him when things would go bad, he was avoidant, he wouldnt talk to me, and that would make me go insane. But its over. It breaks my heart that he did it over text. He didn‚Äôt even wanna see me saying it would be worse cause I would cry and try to manipulate him. The truth is that i‚Äôm losing my mind. This happened last night and i legit had a panic attack I felt like puking I couldn‚Äôt breath, it felt like my mother died (and I know that sounds terrible and dramatic but I swear to god it felt THAT terrible)
We had so many great times together we truly loved each other he was kind I just cant believe i lost my best friend and it‚Äôs all my fault. 
His last message was the he loved me and that I would be fine. So much I wanted to tell him and write him but I can‚Äôt beg anymore and it‚Äôs best to leave him alone before he blocks me. I‚Äôm at work trying no to cry. Sorry for the long text. Please give me tips on how to deal with this. I lost my best friend and my first love.

1o6e8zl,(22F) I don‚Äôt miss him ‚Äî I just don‚Äôt know how to live alone yet.,"(22F) I dated my boyfriend (26M) for seven years. We both promised not to sleep with each other until marriage since we were both virgins. We did everything else except sex. I loved him deeply and truly believed we shared the same goals and future.
    I cooked, cared for him, and gave everything I had emotionally, financially, and physically, thinking once he started working, life would get easier for us. I thought being there for him all the time was how love was supposed to be shown.
    But he stayed home all day and rarely worked. The biggest mistake I made was taking every responsibility on myself. I didn‚Äôt know back then that a man should also take responsibility or at least support his partner. We both claimed to hate ‚Äúgold diggers,‚Äù but I later realized he was the real one and I was too naive to see it.
   He lived in my house because he didn‚Äôt like staying at his mother‚Äôs. I didn‚Äôt realize he was only comfortable because I made his life easier. I fell in love, and he took advantage of my feelings to control me.
    When I turned 20, I started waking up to everything. I felt used, drained, and empty. Most of the money I earned online, along with what my mom sent me monthly, was gone. He would lie, borrow, and manipulate me again and again, and I kept believing him.
     To stop other men from noticing me, he even put things in my food to make me gain weight. I didn‚Äôt know what was happening, I thought maybe it was a health issue because I don‚Äôt eat like a pig. I suggested hospital checkups, and even then, I was the one expected to pay.
He never paid bills, never took me out, never made me feel loved. He just bragged about having a girlfriend with money. Anytime I talked about doing things together, he dodged the topic. But when I mentioned money, suddenly he was interested.
When my visa finally came through, I traveled. He still didn‚Äôt want to let me go. But I knew staying behind would destroy me, he only saw me as his ATM card.
         So I left.
    Now, I live with my parents in Spain. I barely have anything. I gather coins just to buy something small to eat or drink. My mom helped me join a gym to lose weight, and I‚Äôve lost 6kg from 104kg, that‚Äôs something I‚Äôm proud of. But life still feels hard.
    I lost my online job, I don‚Äôt make money anymore, and I barely speak Spanish. My dad wants me to go out and make a living, but I don‚Äôt even know where to start. He doesn‚Äôt care what I do, to make the living. I feel older than my age, and I‚Äôve lost my confidence.
    My landlady is about to throw us out, and I feel completely useless. I want to get a job, but I truly don‚Äôt know where to start. When I say I don‚Äôt know how to do it, please believe me, I really don‚Äôt. I‚Äôve never worked for anyone before.
    He (ex boyfriend) keeps trying to contact my mom, but I ignore him. He was nothing but a parasite in my life. Sometimes I still ask myself, ‚ÄúHow could he do this to me? Was I really alone all those years? Was I that dumb?‚Äù
    Now I‚Äôm left with nothing and no direction. How do I start again? How do I live?
I‚Äôm not asking how to move on from him, I‚Äôm asking how to live now. How do I walk alone and rebuild my life from nothing?
    I‚Äôve thought of so many ways to make money, but I don‚Äôt know how. I even thought of sleeping with someone, that‚Äôs how desperate I was, because the pressure from everyone telling me to ‚Äúgo and make money‚Äù keeps tearing me apart. They all say that when I had money, I gave it to a man.
      I never meant to. I thought he was with me and that was my biggest mistake.
     But the thought of being with someone just for money made me sick. 
    The moment I realized he only wanted what was between my legs, I ran out of his bar crying. I felt disgusted, like I wanted to rip my lips off just to take back that moment. The girls who sleep around for survival‚Ä¶ they are stronger than people realize.
     Still, I changed my mind. I can‚Äôt throw away my virginity for coins. If someone was truly helping me change my life, maybe I‚Äôd understand, but not like this.
     Now I‚Äôm thinking about getting weight loss shots and finding a job with a real contract. Even if it‚Äôs cleaning, anything that helps me stand on my own. Right now, I don‚Äôt have anyone to talk to. It hurts so much. Everything feels sore, my heart, my body and my mind..
I feel so confused. I was told not rush into another relationship. But how do I start...? I hardly sleep these days. It's been five months now. It's just so unbearable.

1o6dzd9,Anniversary is Today,"Hello all!
 Long time lurker, poster here as of lately.
Anyways today should have been 3 years together, I dreamt of him last night. Woke up to the pain, all the feelings associated. 
I decided last week to take today off and am going to Canada and getting a tattoo as I cannot be in the US without me going absolutely nuclear.
I spent some time this weekend with a friend who told me that she recently posted a picture on her Instagram story (Oct. 7) and that he viewed it. The picture was from a wedding we attended all together, the same one when my feet hurt from my shoes he carried me from the church to the car. 
I have had several breakups, but I am now at 8 months and it's still haunting me. He was my best friend for 5 years, we were friends for two years before we got together. This was the man I was going to marry, build a future with.
I know he needs his no contact to heal himself or whatever he says, but it genuinely killed me. I think he's a coward for it truly. When I reached out I was at my lowest, and he just was cold. He treated me cruely, and I know those are his true colors.
I know the holidays are going to be the worst, as we spent them together for the most part. The halloween party we went together to every year is coming up as well, which is not going to be easy.
I know today will be hard. I just need to deal unfortunately with it and continue. Just like every other important day between the break up and now he will not reach out, he will continue no contact, and I just have to tell myself he does not care about me at all as he proved it every day since the break up.",WestStressMongoose,1760444492.0,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o6dzd9/anniversary_is_today/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o6dzd9/anniversary_is_today/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False

It seriously breaks my heart to see people going through the same shit I did. That kind of pain, it‚Äôs indescribable. It was even worse because it was my first heartbreak. I had no idea what to expect. it felt like dying. I couldn‚Äôt eat, I‚Äôd wake up and cry, cry before work, cry myself to sleep because I dreamt of them. Watching them move on, ignore me, treat me like I never existed. The person I once called my best friend? the person I wanted to marry? they were gone. I didn‚Äôt recognize them anymore. 

But now, I can finally say I‚Äôm in a place where I don‚Äôt care for them the way I used to. 

I used to come here every day, scrolling through posts just hoping the pain would stop or that there was a person who would give me hope/say just the right words to make me feel better. And seeing people post here now with feelings I know too well‚Ä¶ it hits hard. I wish I could tell everyone still hurting that even though there is nothing I can say to help, time really does heal. 

The person you thought was one of a kind? The person you thought you‚Äôd never love someone as much as you loved them? The person you thought was your soulmate? You will get over them. I promise you, they‚Äôre not the last person you‚Äôll love. You‚Äôll fall in love again. And again. And again. Don‚Äôt let this consume you. You‚Äôll be okay. I promise.

1o6d5cc,This is a long one but I am so confused why does my ex continue to silently visit my Instagram like this after everything she's done and said?,"So its been about 4 months since the breakup and I can not for for the life of me understand whats going through this girls head, at the start she was very defensive and if I showed any concern for her she snapped at me, my every kindness which is just who I am seems to be mistaken as me flirting with her, I have left her alone since, started using Instagram again as a way to just vent and distract myself, removed all followers except for her and as a result I saw in my insight every time she visited, she has ignored me for the most part because ""I don't want to give you hope"" then at some point she was stuck and had to break the silence to ask me for help with money as she had no one else to turn to, so I helped making it very clear I will not hold it over her head and I don't want anything from her, she seemed very grateful for the help and again I mostly left her alone, on multiple occasions she has flipped at me, making it clear that it was over and she doesn't want anything to do with me anymore, rewriting the narrative of me in her head blowing everything out of proportion, calling me insane and obsessed, manipulative even, all while continuing to visit my profile over and over, all I've done is give her space, apologising for my part in everything and working hard on myself, all she does on the other hand is say ""I made mistakes too but your fault! Your fault! Your fault!"" Refusing to see my point of view while I've done nothing but try to understand hers doing my best but she wouldn't even allow me the chance to show up as better, but yeah she eventually snapped at me again, she does that a lot, made it clear she now has a new boyfriend who she says she is very happy with, I respect that so I backed off and I left her alone, I unfollowed and removed her from everything a long time ago, after telling me she had a new boyfriend and him being the ""jealous type"", she was talking about wanting peace with me, then days later I get ghosted and she deletes the account she was using, she mentioned have new accounts, which thanks to Instagram suggesting them to me I ended up finding as well as her dumb ass continuing to visit my profile cause she viewed my story multiple times from separate accounts, I guess she eventually realized I could see her viewing my story and so stopped viewing, I left her alone and stayed silent, leaving a blank white post at the bottom of my feed set to close friends only which if viewing from grid you can't tell its there and Instagram seems to register views from grid, checking my insight she is still visiting my account not like every time she is online but she still makes regular visits, sometimes she will stop for like a week, my account has been fairly quiet, nothing much to see but she keeps visiting after all the ""I AM DONE! I HAVE A NEW BOYFRIEND! YOU HAVE TO LET ME GO!""talk and i don't understand why, why when there is nothing to feed her ego and barely any life on my account does she come back, she does not view anything she literally just visits my account probably thinking i can't see her but I know because the blank close friends only post keeps registering view every time she visits (her accounts are the only accounts in my close friends list), if you are so done then fuck off, why come back every few days for months like that? I don't get her, she keeps being cold, angry and defensive but silently visits my account with no interaction with anything that will leave a trace.

You were right to leave and had every reason to feel afraid. That morning must have been terrifying and confusing. You needed safety and peace and I failed to give you both.

When everything fell apart, I made it worse by how I handled things. I reached out when I shouldn‚Äôt have and said things that only added to the pain. You didn‚Äôt deserve the chaos that followed or the silence that came after.

It took a long time to understand what really happened. It‚Äôs called REM: Sleep Behavior Disorder and it makes people act out dreams while asleep. Knowing that doesn‚Äôt change what you felt. The fear was real and you shouldn‚Äôt have had to face it.

This isn‚Äôt about asking for anything. It‚Äôs simply the truth and an apology for what I put you through. I‚Äôll always love you, and my wish is that you‚Äôve found peace, love, and happiness after the hell I caused.

P. S.
I sensed your presence at San Japan last year as soon as I walked in. The feeling was overwhelming.

1o6cowe,I (29M) cheated on my girlfriend (30F) and feel suicidal. I don't know what to do,"Until recently, I had been a in relationship with a girl for about 6 months (before this my last relationship was about 10 years ago). She's a really sweet girl and I loved her (and still do, despite what people will say). But for the past few years, I've struggled badly with depression, and many events this year had led me to what I thought at the time was rock bottom. I lost almost all of my savings, initially just to an unfortunate event, but subsequently through gambling. I started going to a counsellor about that a few weeks ago but wasn't finding it to be much help yet. And I stopped progressing in my career, to the point where I feel like a total failure. 

I think the very start of my depression was when my dad cheated on my mum several years ago, and my mum was suicidal at this time (told me she was thinking of ending it) but thankfully she is still with us. I developed a severe hatred for my father, I couldn't understand how he could ever do that to anyone.

Along with this, I've felt incredibly lonely for the last 10 years. Finally this year I met someone, and it was going great for quite a while. But recently I realised that she was showing very little affection for me, and it was cause for concern. 

We had a weekend away recently, and afterwards I was dropping her off at the bus stop, but we'd just had a (very small) argument about a minor thing. When she left, I said ""love you"", to which she just waved and said ""bye"". Which I was pretty upset about, and getting worried.

I was planning to have a chat to her about the lack of affection, but I had an upcoming holiday planned, for 2 weeks away with friends, on the other side of the world. 

We had initially agreed that I would stay with her for the night before my journey (which was going to be 20-30 hours) and her house was about 2 hours closer to the airport, so it made sense.
But the day before, shortly before I was about to leave, she told me that she didn't want me over because she had a late day at work and having me over would stress her out more. I could tell that something was up obviously, and she said ""We can speak when you're back"" (in 2 weeks).

This was concerning for a few reasons, firstly, she didn't want to see me the night before I'd leave for 2 weeks, secondly, the idea of having me over was adding to her stress instead of being a comfort, thirdly, she didn't seem bothered at all about changing my travel plans last minute and adding 2 hours to my already long journey.

I think I knew then that something bad was coming, and basically I assumed she didn't love me anymore. 
I was thinking about this for about 30 hours on the way to my holiday, and when I left I didn't get a message from her for quite a few hours, until she sent a basic, ""Hi [name], safe travels, enjoy your trip!"" message (previously, she would always say ""my love"" or something like that, or at least some romantic emojis). 

And then that whole day, and the next day, there was no affection shown at all, no calling me ""my love"", reacting with thumbs up instead of hearts. But she mentioned that we need to have talk but she didn't want to until I got back. I tried to arrange to talk to her while on holiday instead, but the timezones meant she couldn't (well, we probably could have in her morning time, but she was barely texting me at all, so it didn't happen). 

So, for the whole flight and since then, I'd basically felt the worst I'd ever felt. In my head I knew she was going to leave me, and the relationship was over. She was the one good thing left in my life and I'd lost her. This was the worst I'd ever felt, and I already hadn't slept at all for several days because of the gambling losses and my career going down the toilet.

But, on the flight over, I was sitting beside a woman probably about twice my age, who barely spoke any English. At the end of the flight, she asked for my help filling out security forms, so I did, and she handed me her phone and said ""give me your number"", and I thought she wanted it in case she had any language issues with security. I went ahead and gave her it.

Anyway the next day after the flight I get a text from that woman, just saying hello. I responded and then she started asking where I was. I thought it was weird, but I replied and made basic conversation, even though it made little since with her broken English.

 I didn't find this woman attractive at all (in fact I found her quite unattractive and was rude and annoying on the plane), and there was literally no chemistry or anything between us whatsoever. And I thought (and still believe) she really just wanted a green card. She was staying stuff like she wants to marry me (literally the day after I spoke to her for about 20 seconds on the plane).

But then, the conversation turned dirty, and I ended up asking her stuff like ""What would you like to do to me"" and things like that. At one point I asked for nudes, pretty much knowing she wouldn't, but just wanting to see what would happen. I don't really know why I did this, I think mostly curiousity. She wasn't visually attractive to me at all. 

To be honest at the time I guess I thought it was kind of amusing/entertaining (shameful, I know, but at the time it just felt like I was talking to a chatbot or something, it didn't feel real) given the age difference and randomness of it and just wanted to see what would happen, but also, at the time, I just wanted to feel like someone was actually interested in me, because I was feeling so unwanted and unloved. But in reality, I knew neither of us actually liked each other. 

Anyway, in the end she suggested that I come over to her hotel to do things. I didn't, I knew this was wrong. 
But the fact that I was doing any of this stuff in the first place just makes me feel so ashamed and disgusted with myself. I couldn't sleep for several days, and of course wasn't enjoying my holiday at all, constantly thinking about this, but also just waiting for my girlfriend to tell me that the relationship was over.

Eventually, I managed to get texting my girlfriend for a bit of time, and basically told her to just tell me she doesn't want to see me anymore, because I already knew. She wanted to wait til got I back, but then yes she admitted this was the end.

We managed to have a call the next day, which was very emotional, and basically it turned out she still thought I was a great person but felt a lack of connection. This kind of shocked me because it seemed like she still cared about me (albeit not romantically) when I'd been stuck thinking she didn't care about me at all. 

But then it really hit me again about how bad it was, that had texted that stuff to the woman from the plane. I felt (and still feel) gross, disgusted, and ashamed of myself. I felt I had to tell my now ex-girlfriend about this. I did and we were texting back and forth about it. She basically forgave me immediately and actually said she's sorry she caused this, she felt guilty for the lack of affection and making me feel this way.  

While I appreciate that she forgave me, it kind of makes me feel worse, because I know what I did was wrong and I don't deserve forgiveness, and I can't forgive myself for this. 

And worst of all, after telling her this, I asked her if the relationship was already over at that point (when I was texting the woman (not that that would make it okay)). She said doesn't know, she was still deciding at that time. 
So that makes me feel so much worse, because in my head at the time, I had already accepted that she had dumped me, or so I thought. When in reality it ended up being a few days later.

So since then (a few days ago) I've barely thought about anything else, haven't slept, and feel worse than ever. I don't know how to accept that I'm a cheater, because i always believed these were the worst possible human beings, and now I am one. I don't know how I can live with myself anymore. I hurt someone I love (even if she didn't love me anymore at the time).

I'm still on this holiday and don't fly home for another week. I feel awful and don't know what to do. 

If anyone has actually read this, sorry for the massive wall of text, I know none of it excuses what I did, but I felt I just had to spit it all out.",Normal-Music-4433,1760440620.0,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o6cowe/i_29m_cheated_on_my_girlfriend_30f_and_feel/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o6cowe/i_29m_cheated_on_my_girlfriend_30f_and_feel/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False

1o6cnlm,I‚Äôve made a grave mistake.,"I may not have left you, but I‚Äôm for sure the guilty party. In the beginning, I was soft for you. That‚Äôs the part that I wanna remember. I was soft for you the way that you‚Äôve always been soft for me. I was present, I couldn‚Äôt look away from you at times. How often do people comment? ‚ÄúWhy is he staring at you?‚Äù of course they did, I didn‚Äôt do anything to hide it. Your safety, your happiness, your health, your children, my world revolved around you. Sometimes, you would ask me if I was love bombing you. And I‚Äôm thinking back I really see how you thought that. Especially after we lost our son. And everything changed. My love never died, and I don‚Äôt believe yours did either. You can‚Äôt starve something so powerful intentionally or not. But it did hard for a while under the pain and loss and grief. I wish I‚Äôve been there for you and the way that really represented how I feel. Something so special doesn‚Äôt ever go away if even fade but It did hide, I was bitter and angry. You told me before that you feel like I blame you, and I could never ever do that. you didn‚Äôt do this. Never would do this to him. When we found outof course we were scared. I was afraid that having a child of my own, would somehow diminish the connection I have with your existing children. I was scared that I wouldn‚Äôt be a good dad and you comforted me. In a way that I didn‚Äôt know as possible. Encouraged me to be a better person. Encourage me exist in a place where family is who you love and who you‚Äôll be there for. I didn‚Äôt need to have blood in your children‚Äôs veins to be their dad. They will always have fathers and I don‚Äôt wanna be that. Having kids turned you into who you are you were always a provider, you were always motherly, but not the way you are a mom. There‚Äôs something powerful to a way that you care for people and I can‚Äôt explain it. Honestly, I hope I never understand it because not knowing does make it feel even more special. I don‚Äôt have to understand it, I don‚Äôt have to be able to replicate it. Because nobody else would ever have it, and you would always share it with me. and when we had the miscarriage my world stopped. That fear that excitement became a pit inside my stomach that consumed me I was here physically, but not mentally not emotionally. I was so consumed by that pain that I didn‚Äôt cater to you the way that you needed. The way that you deserved. Not only as a grieving mother, but as my partner. As my person you needed me to be soft and more than ever and I would love to save the world callous to me. It‚Äôs not my fault, but it‚Äôs 100% my fault you needed me to reassure you and to love you the way that I always had and still do, but instead, I let my grief turn to anger, and then anger to bitter. sometimes it was hard to hold your son. It was hard to read a book to your daughter. Not because I didn‚Äôt love them, because I always thought like why not me? Why not me why can everybody else have kids not me why would anyone put someone through this. And I never thought you were the one doing it. The stupidest part is that I do have kids or had kids I guess. They were a part of you that you shared with me, part that I love more than anything on the planet. I sit here in this apartment along. I regret that I would love to say it wasn‚Äôt a choice. It just happened, but that‚Äôs not true. It‚Äôs always a choice to be present for somebody especially somebody who is present for you. You did things that Mother should never have to do. You took care of me and the only way that I knew how to ask for and now, I regret that too you needed me to take care of you. I sat there that night and brushed your hair after we showered the blood off of you. That‚Äôs who you needed. That‚Äôs who I wanted to be and my bitterness slowly killed that man. At least it felt like that if I could do it again. it would‚Äôve never been bitter. I wish I could take that time, but I had trouble sitting with our family and make it something more. I‚Äôm finally seeing the healing that everybody promised me last December. I‚Äôm finally feeling better and being able to love your kids again, I just wish it was in our home. I wish I was together. We couldn‚Äôt grieve together, we didn‚Äôt start the healing process together. But we have the opportunity to finish it together. This awful wound will never go away. Don‚Äôt ever be on scene. And we don‚Äôt have the exact same one, but just like the tattoos on the arm they match. They may not be identical, but neither are we and we don‚Äôt have to be I would give anything to have the opportunity. Give anything for a chance to show you that you don‚Äôt have to beg me to be nice, but I can grieve and hurt and still be here for me. That‚Äôs what you deserved then, it‚Äôs what I can offer now. When we fight sometimes I send you books and books and books about how angry I am. And today I wrote you books about how much I love you and it was so much easier than writing a hateful message. Because you are something that inspires love in me. There was never an effort to loving you, there was never an effort to wanting you around. We can‚Äôt wait to see you again just stare at you and drink you and watch your moves like it I look away I may never see you again. Because now more than ever it‚Äôs a real possibility. And I thought I was scared when you were pregnant I‚Äôm 1 billion times more scared now. Not because the loss was easier, or harder, but because we are meant to be family and we‚Äôve already lost one. I can‚Äôt lose you too.

1o6clc1,Did I scare him off?,"Me and this guy only went on two dates over two weeks. We talked on the phone, texted every day, and even made plans for the next couple of months. On our last date, which was honestly the most fun I have ever had on a date (both dates were the best dates I‚Äôve ever been on), we were kissing in the car. I told him I was not going to sleep with anyone unless it was something more serious, he liked and respected that and then he completely pulled away. He said he was not into me, that I was not his type, and that we would not be seeing each other again. He was polite about it, but I was shocked. 

It came out of nowhere. I know he liked me because he was the one asking to call me, he had a list of future dates for us, dates which extended out over the next two months, he was making plans and jokes about us moving in or going on a trip, and we had already made out a few times. It just does not add up. I told him I was not expecting anything serious. I did not need to meet his parents or move fast, I just wanted exclusivity. He seemed fine with that at first and that I was the ‚Äúonly one on his roster.‚Äù Then I asked what he thought about relationships, and he did not really give me an answer. He just said he was new to this. About thirty seconds later he said he was not into me and did not want to see me again.

I went from having the best date of my life, my hand on his thigh and his in my hair, to ending things in the span of a thirty second car ride.

I feel a little led on and kind of gross, like he just wanted me for sex maybe. The worst part is I really fell for him. I thought this time might be different, maybe something more genuine or traditional, which feels rare as a gay man. I guess I am just venting, but also trying to figure out how to move on. It is hard to accept how quickly it all changed, and part of me still hopes he will reach out and say he made a mistake. I just really liked him and I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it all.

1o6c451,Feelings changed over long distance in a week,"

I met this girl while on holiday five months ago and we really hit it off, slept together on holiday, then went on a date the next day. We share the same hobbies, music tastes, and have a playful, flirty dynamic that just clicked. We‚Äôve been talking daily since then, but she lives about two and a half hours away, so seeing each other in person has been tricky. The last couple of months, we‚Äôve started phoning regularly.

The dynamic has been really up and down for me. I often felt like I was putting in more effort ‚Äî constantly trying to arrange plans, suggesting meetups, even travelling down ‚Äî while she often responded with ‚Äúmaybe,‚Äù ‚Äúdepends,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôll see what I‚Äôm doing,‚Äù rarely following through or offering alternatives. We met once last month for a date; I slept with her and stayed at hers. There were times when she seemed really affectionate ‚Äî late-night calls, sending TikToks and reels (mostly sexual jokes, or couple things, relationship things, date ideas), chatting, planning things ‚Äî which made me feel she genuinely wanted something. But then she‚Äôd occasionally pull back, disappear, or act distant, leaving me confused and questioning where I stood.

This past weekend really made things click. I was in her city to see my friend and asked if we could meet for 20‚Äì30 minutes for coffee. She didn‚Äôt make the time, said she was too busy, and then blanked me the entire night which isn‚Äôt like her at all, but she‚Äôd been pulling away all week. It became clear to me that her mind was made up ‚Äî it wasn‚Äôt about being busy. I realized I‚Äôd been feeling uncertain for months and probably should‚Äôve walked away long ago. She ended things on Sunday, citing distance, busyness, and anxiety. For context, we met finally again in mid-September and agreed to be exclusive, had planned to meet last weekend (but I was ill so cancelled), and could‚Äôve met this weekend. That‚Äôs more than some short-distance couples I know, so it felt like something else was going on.

Over the last couple of months, she acted like my ‚Äúfuture girlfriend‚Äù ‚Äî late night calls, chats, trip ideas ‚Äî then suddenly backtracked, saying she didn‚Äôt want to lead me on. This decision came over the course of a week right after I cancelled, even though things had been the best they‚Äôd been between us the week leading up to it ‚Äî flirty, jokey, planning me coming down. It didn‚Äôt add up, but I realized I was chasing someone who wasn‚Äôt fully truthful or making me a priority.

As i say she messaged me Sunday to say she doesn‚Äôt see this going long term, citing busyness and distance. She said she was just too busy to see me even when I was in her city so no way this can go on. I didn‚Äôt fully believe that, knowing she avoided me that weekend. If she wanted to see me she would, i asked for 20 mins. She added that her anxiety made her need to focus on herself. I didn‚Äôt reply yesterday. Our 140-day streak died and she turned her location off for me on Snapchat.

Part of me wants to reply one last time to explain how I felt over the last few months, that i know that isn‚Äôt the full reason, i know she avoided me, i feel very led on and played, but I‚Äôm torn ‚Äî I don‚Äôt want to seem soppy or give her the final say in our dynamic, and I also know that sending something won‚Äôt change anything and might just make me feel worse waiting on a reply or not getting one. At least if i just ignore I feel like i‚Äôve left with dignity (even after kind of begging to talk about things as opposed to ending it).

1o6byzd,I‚Äôm shattering into pieces,"Mainly a vent, but advice is appreciated.

I never knew it was possible to miss someone so much. It‚Äôs only been a few days but a hole has been formed in my chest, and I‚Äôm gasping for air. It‚Äôs so hard to read him, I can‚Äôt predict how he is feeling. He doesn‚Äôt want to be vulnerable with me, I scared him away from that long ago; he wants to be a strong man.

I‚Äôm dying to know how he feels. At first it seemed like he regretted his decision, but then I had to go and say ‚Äúno contact‚Äù, just until we have thought things through on our own. I really thought he would‚Äôve caved. I feel so guilty that I didn‚Äôt fully grasp what he was going through. I just thought, ‚Äúhere‚Äôs my perfect person, my best friend, the person I‚Äôd share my life with‚Äù. I could‚Äôve done so much more to make his life easier. 

I can‚Äôt sleep anymore. I slept for days. I feel like we should stay no contact, but I can‚Äôt bear the thought that he wants me back and I‚Äôm not there. I want to hold him one last time and tell everything is going to be okay. I know how much he is suffering under the weight of the world.

1o6bw3c,Asking for some advice and perspective so I can avoid a repeat,"I‚Äôm a 30-year-old woman seeking advice and perspective about my current situation with my ex-boyfriend, 28, whom I‚Äôll call L. My romantic experiences have been challenging, and with L, I really thought he was the one‚ÄîI was faithful and truly believed we would marry. Despite this, he treated me terribly. He‚Äôs never apologized or shown any remorse or empathy for the pain he caused, even though I always admitted my mistakes and apologized when I was wrong.One of the worst experiences was discovering he cheated on me. While he was away in jail and treatment and I was using his phone because mine was broken, I received disturbing messages from two people whose numbers weren‚Äôt saved. After some investigation, I realized one was a woman (J) he‚Äôd slept with. She messaged not knowing I had his phone, saying, 'Why didn‚Äôt you tell me that before we hooked up in your truck where your girlfriend sits'‚Äîwhich felt cruel and humiliating.The other messages came from P, his friend S‚Äôs ex-girlfriend, who he was also involved with. She sent abusive messages, mocking my past traumas and telling me to kill myself. This left me devastated and alone while L was away. When he returned and I showed him the messages, he just deleted them and excused P‚Äôs behavior, saying she was bipolar, as if that explained everything.Currently, L is sober and living at an Oxford house, and he has a new girlfriend. I‚Äôm still living at his mom‚Äôs place because I have nowhere else to go and no support system aside from her. Even so, I find it hard to talk to her about things that bother me, so I keep it all inside.After breaking up with L, I met another guy‚ÄîA‚Äîwho seemed great at first and even moved in. He gained L‚Äôs mom‚Äôs approval, but after several months, he became mentally and emotionally abusive, constantly accusing me of cheating even though I rarely left the house. Eventually, the abuse turned physical and he was kicked out. After all of this, I feel mentally and emotionally drained.I‚Äôm desperate for advice and any perspective on how to break this cycle, avoid these situations in the future, and regain my strength.

1o6bsq9,My ex and bsf of almost 3 years broke up with me,"The relationship was going great the first year we were in the best times of our lives together, we were intimate and so loving.

The downfall started happening after we had some issues in the relationship that triggered old trapped emotions I thought i let go on my first healing journey 

The more issues were arising we always made sure we didnt sleep mar at eachothers but i always got cold, mostly from self doubt and if im doing enough

I started making up fake scenarios in my head till it took control of my life and hers

I lacked at work, our talks were so surface level
And i made the mistake of opening up about how i felt about the last couple of months in the relationship and how i felt and what we should do moving forward to ensure our rs stays stable

But once again i couldnt make my point reach out in a healthy way

Time passed and she wanted to break up after she has family issues, uni issues that i was trying to help her with and that our rs got a bit cold

She said she cant handle anything anymore and she wants space to allign herself
Called me her first and last, doesnt mind me checking  up on her

I took time to reflect and understood where the issue began, and where it rooted from
I started journaling identifying emotions
Turning my overthinking to critical healthy thoughts 

Last time we got in touch was last week 
We still have streaks together, we have an invisible line between us

What would be the best way to re introduce myself moving forward, its hard i know but im willing to marry her.

1o6bmk4,What can I (20M)  learn from this Breakup experience and also my first love?,"Basically we met on a dating app, talked for a week and I was lovebombed for the week (I was new to dating so I didn't know what red flags to look for, especially this one). After that love bombing I invited her (19F) for some coffee, but she rejected me and started being cold, on her dating profile I saw she uploaded new photos even though her excuse for not going to get coffee with me was ""I'm not ready for a relationship"", as if getting some coffee is a couples thing now. But she started texting me and lovebombing again 3 days later.

A month has passed of us texting each other and I thought it was the time to offer to meet again, was rejected, but she came back the same day and 2 days later invited me to a date. Everything went well, our chemistry matched, we spent a good time, I even met her mom at the first date.

We met up a total of 5 times throughout May-July, I always invited her to go somewhere but she was either ""feeling under the weather"" or something else. Her parents really loved me, because they saw how much I want to care for her, but her cold-hot behavior was driving me crazy, she would rather meet up with her classmates than with me. On my birthday she went to drink with them and didn't invite me, on the day didn't even congratulate me until I told her ""thanks for the congratulations"". She started apologizing and telling me how much she loves me. She always texted me saying that she's not good for me and I always reassured that I love her the way she is, and won't ever leave her.

Then came the final day of the relationship, August 1st. aka the ""Girlfriend day"". We met up at her house and I bought her plenty of gifts, had BBQ with her parents. Everything seemed perfect. Had our first sleepover. Next morning I went home and was hit by ""I'm not ready for a relationship, you treated me like a princess but I couldn't understand it"".

I was very confused, angry. She wanted to stay friends. I wanted to try it, even though I know that's not how it goes. A month passed, she downloaded Tinder again, and that was my last nail in the coffin. I always innitiated conversations but she didn't seem interested, even though she was the one to suggest ""Friendship"". Her downloading Tinder angered me very much and I called her ""Childish, mentally immature"", with no intention to hurt her, because she herself has told me that she's not mentally mature yet. After that I got blocked everywhere on her socials, even though I tried apologizing for calling her childish, but she didn't care to listen.

My question is, what could I learn from this? It seemed like I did everything correctly, made her feel seen, loved, appreciated with gifts, and tons of attention. And is there a chance she would contact me in the future, since it's my first ""true"" love and it's hard to get over it.

1o6bf43,Last night I left my long-distance boyfriend of 3 years that I love more than myself,"Last night, I made the hardest decision of my life: I broke up with the person I have loved more than myself for three years.

We tried for three years to fix our issues. I begged him to take initiative for his own healing while crying almost every night because he felt distant, had barely anything to tell me, and rarely took emotional initiative‚Äîbeyond suggesting to meet in person, saying generic love words and basic compliments after the honeymoon phase, or travel to see me, which I genuinely cherished and appreciated.

I suffered endlessly when I expressed concerns: his porn usage, lack of intimate calls, or when I asked for tenderness and care during my most painful and vulnerable times. Many times when I asked for affection, he called me *‚Äúneedy‚Äù* or *ungrateful* for ignoring all his efforts and erasing all his good deeds without really trying to understand what I was asking from him. I endured broken promises, emotional dismissals, being mocked or yelled at when crying because my raising a concern automatically turns into a heated argument, and even breakups over small things. For example, before my birthday, I prepared a special picnic and tea for him, and he criticized it: *‚ÄúThis tea‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt drink it. Too plain. Can I pour it down?‚Äù* so I got hurt. He told me, ""Okay, sorry, sorry, but you are too sensitive"" with an annoyed then acted mad when I didn't magically turn cheerful. It turned into an argument so bad that he told me ""you are insane and I am breaking up with you"".

I constantly heard that my needs were insatiable, that my wounds and trauma were the problem, and that my depression relapse had nothing to do with him. Even in my moments of vulnerability, he used my past self-harm scars as proof that I was always ‚Äúsick.‚Äù I followed his advices as best as I could, saw a therapist, tried to get better‚Äîbut it was never enough. He wanted me to just be happy with him being present in my life no matter what. I always felt I was the source of all problems, while his anger, temper, lack of emotional availability, unhealthy conflict management, porn usage, and foul language were never addressed. I am not an angel. I admit and admitted to him that I have a lot of things to work on myself. I apologized for not raising my concerns without blaming him and I knew it was a problem that I have to work on. I admitted that I panic and get anxious for nothing ( which never happened in my past relationships). I really tried very hard to get better, to heal, to lessen my anxiety, lessen my emotional needs. I was raised with secure and emotionally mature and present parents but I have a lot of wounds from school bullying, racism (I am ethnically mixed) and religioius shaming at school . I showed him every little progress I did everytime, I opened up about every new thing I learnt about during my healing journey, only for him to say ""yes, but all your efforts failed"" in the end or used my openness agaisnt me when I raised a concern about some of his behaviors... I wanted him to reciprocate and try to become more self-aware, understand how his behavior impacted me despite his intentions being good.. I reassured him that I knew his intentions where good even if not enough and everytime, I apologized for telling him he doesn't love me and care about me when I was hurt but not enough... I just wanted him to put the same efforts I put to understand how he participated in the creation of the unhealthy dynamics between us.

The previous night of our breakup, I reached my breaking point. He noticed I sounded sad, my voice was breaking, I was barely talking so he asked me 3 times what was wrong. When I softly said, *‚ÄúNothing to worry about,‚Äù* he responded cheerfully, *‚ÄúAlright babe, goodnight. Love you, sleep well‚Äù*‚Äîand hung up which broke me. I called again to explain that I was hurt by his behavior, asked why he left just like that why he couldn't just give me presence, be there with me until I was okay, even if I couldn‚Äôt explain why, why he didn't suggest it himsef without me asking him every single time. He told me *"" I asked you 3 times what's wrong, you didn't answer, so what did you want me to do? I thought I'd better go to sleep at least""*  when I tried to further explain my expectations and how much I need him right then to be sweet and loving he ended up getting angry, yelled, and said, *‚ÄúGive me some rest. I won‚Äôt accept you blaming me any further‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt push me over the edge, or else‚Ä¶‚Äù*

So I finally said, *‚ÄúI will give you rest forever. Farewell.‚Äù*

This morning, he spoke to me as if nothing had happened. I decided to detach and later officially broke up with him in the most loving softest way possible. I made sure he was okay first, I made sure his health was alright, I made sure he had company, I wished him well, I told him that our love is not enough anymore to keep us going forward, that we bring out the worst in each other, that I can't see him being hurt anymore and unhappy because of me and that I can't guarantee that I will not get more sick and even be able to survive because my body and mental health are literally at breaking point, I apologized for involving his siblings, I thanked him for every beautiful memory, help, love and his care. That I genuinely appreciate everything he did for me but I can't see how we can keep going forward anymore. To which he answered me "" *Well, I hope you meet a man who will be present every minute of the day for you, meet all your emotional needs in the form you want it and expect it*"" the he said his mindsent and philosophy of life were right. He reminded me how he predicted that I will leave him. He also told me to not jump into the next relationship fast (something I never did. I only dated 3 times. 5 years between the first and second and a year and half between the second ex and him) because I need to heal my wounds and trauma and void that I have inside of me that I try to fill through insane love from others. That no matter how the man will be history will repeat itself if I don't heal and I will never be satisfied...

Breaking up filled me with guilt and heartbreak. I wanted to stay. I wanted to choose him, love him, and make him happy. I wanted to hug him, comfort him, and tell him I‚Äôm sorry for hurting him by suggesting separtion. I wanted to continue building our life together. But I couldn‚Äôt anymore. My love for him was slowly destroying me emotionally and physically, and I couldn‚Äôt survive by his side in his current version. I was hurting, and I was hurting him too.

Sometimes, it‚Äôs not that the other person (the dumper) isn‚Äôt your person. Sometimes, the dumper really wanted to be yours, chose you over and over, and loved you deeply‚Äîbut despite all that, love alone wasn‚Äôt enough to make you understand them and meet them in the middle. Sometimes you were too stubborn or rigid to see another point of view, which drove your partner to leave you, so you can also heal and grow, and so they can somehow survive because being by your side hurts them more than separation now.

I miss him tremendously. I still see him as the love of my life and can‚Äôt imagine talking to or seeing anyone else ever. I will love him forever, adore him from afar, and hope that one day, somehow, we might meet again and be happy together. But for now, letting go was the hardest‚Äîand the most loving‚Äîthing I could do for both of us.

I love you ""Y"", I will always love you and I will cherish all our memories dearly. I will miss you tremendously. I hope a miracle will happen to bring us back together but now as 2 new healthy individuals that are compatible with each other, and if not I wish you to meet the woman of your dreams who will give you what I couldn't... I am sorry for hurting you in this way and for any other hurt I caused you. Please be safe, happy and healthy my love.",LiiA_Snss,1760436357.0,1,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o6bf43/last_night_i_left_my_longdistance_boyfriend_of_3/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o6bf43/last_night_i_left_my_longdistance_boyfriend_of_3/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False

1o6bbzh,M21 F21 Did my girlfriend cheat?," Hey guys need advice.
Have been in my current relationship for more than 3 years, no breaks no other partners. 
This week i felt the need to test for STD, which was positive. Is there any way that I‚Äôve had this symptom free for 3 years since my ex and only prior partner? 
For extra context, I seriously cant imagine that she has cheated, it doesn‚Äôt feel possible and I‚Äôve had zero reason to think she had been unfaithful prior. 
However she had been tested as part of checkup just over a year ago, which was negative‚Ä¶ 

This raises the question that she has cheated since and passed it onto me recently.

I will add the only part of me that thinks it was possible that i recently got put onto immunosuppressants, so in my mind potentially  the STD has shown symptoms only now after 3 years due to a compromised immune system.
But then as a counter argument i had a week on high does IV amoxicillin last year which im thinking would have cleared anything i did have from 3 years ago.

1o6babw,Should I break NO CONTACT because I'm afraid of being alone?,"Hello everyone,
It's now been a little over 4 months since my ex left me. And honestly, it's still very difficult for me.
The hardest part is that all my friends in the city where I am are also mutual friends, and I can sense that things are shifting a little on his side. It's not a criticism, I understand: she's probably better than me, she's the one who made the decision to break up, and I'm still sad.

I'm not in major depression: I try to move around, I play sports, I've started playing music again, I try to take care of myself. But it would be a lie to say that the breakup no longer affects me on a daily basis. I kept our apartment, and there are still lots of memories everywhere.
I miss our times together. I also miss times with our friends. I even miss the cat we had together. There are lots of little things about this life together that I miss... and I simply miss her.

Since the breakup, I have only seen her once again, at a party with mutual friends. The evening went pretty well, but the days that followed were very complicated. I was completely emotionally drained.
And today, I'm already starting to dread the New Year. These friends are also the ones with whom I celebrate it every year. I've been spending New Year's Eve with them for almost 15 years, it's become a real tradition, one of the highlights of my year.
So yes, I know that it‚Äôs ‚Äújust an evening‚Äù, that it doesn‚Äôt involve anything, but just the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãnot being with them makes me sad. At the same time, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãgoing there and meeting my ex scares me even more.
And I think, somewhere, I'm afraid of being alone that evening. Not necessarily to be alone physically, but to feel that I no longer have my place in this group, nor in this tradition which was part of my life for so long.

So I don't know what to do. Do I go there, even if I know that seeing her risks putting me back for several days? Or do I protect myself, even if it means spending this moment alone without being sure that it will be much better?
I know that many here advise not to break the no contact, and it is true that this is what helps me the most to move forward. It doesn't take away all the sadness, but at least it allows me to breathe a little.
The last time I saw her, I spent the next 3 or 4 days crying.
So I ask myself: do I want to start 2026 like this, crying, regretting, going backwards?
Or should I protect myself, even if it means spending the holidays differently?

I don't really know.

1o6b4vi,Me and my gf broke up during summer and we met again at work,"A little context about this. I met my ex girlfriend at work and at that time she was in a relationship but I had a feeling that she liked me in someway. I take my bicycle to work and we ended up leaving work together and chatting about stuff. Who would‚Äôve guessed i started catching feelings and had a hunch im not the only one. Fast forward she broke up with her ex and i knew about it because she told me about whats going on with her life. A bit later we ended up confessing our feelings to eachother and went forward with our relationship.

At the time we knew about the risk off starting something new nearly instantly her old one ended, but decided to see how it goes. Well no one is surprised we had some slight issues, but we talked them through. Now in august during our holiday from work we broke up due to the same reasons, those being I felt like I was the only one committed to it, planning things and asking if we could meetup. It felt like shit and i decided that either she does something about it or we cant continue. We decided to break up, no drama or anything like that. Just a mutual breakup because things didn‚Äôt work.

I had a longer time off paid leave than she and came back to work later. The first shock is that it felt like nothing had happened. We talked about it again and mutually agreed this is weird how natural it seems. That‚Äôs a couple months ago and i was fine until the recent cpuple weeks. We have been chatting over text about stuff regarding us and other random things and work. Im starting to feel like theres a chance for redemption due to all the signs that are there. I acknowledge the issues, but they arent anythign that cant be talked through.

However she says that she cannot currently give me what i need, but also says she cant deny the possibility that we could be together. Due to this im a bit lost on this matter and dont know how what to do or say. Even after all the not so good things in our relationship, i still care a lot about her.

1o6ar69,What are the reasons why you wouldn't date a recently divorced man?,"* **Emotional Unavailability:**¬†A recently divorced man is often still processing the grief, anger, pain, and loss associated with the end of his marriage. He may be emotionally unavailable and unable to prioritize a new partner, as he needs time to heal and find his footing as an individual.
* **Being a Rebound:**¬†Jumping into a new relationship too soon often results in a ""rebound"" situation, where you may be used as a distraction or a ""consolation prize"" to help him forget his pain, rather than being a truly valued partner.
* **Unresolved Baggage:**¬†Without sufficient time for self-reflection and personal growth, he may not have learned from his past mistakes or identified his own role in the marriage's failure, potentially dooming the new relationship to repeat similar patterns.
* **Family Complications:**¬†If he has children, they may be struggling with the divorce and could resent a new person in their father's life. You may feel like an ""outsider"" in his established family dynamic, and his children's needs will, and should, always come first, which can affect your own feelings of priority.
* **""Ex"" Drama:**¬†The ex may still be a significant, and potentially hostile, presence in his life due to co-parenting or ongoing legal and financial negotiations. You may get caught in the middle of this conflict or become his sounding board for bitterness, which is not a healthy role for a romantic partner.
* **Financial Strain:**¬†Divorce can be expensive, involving legal fees, alimony, and child support, which may lead to a strained financial situation. This can limit the type of lifestyle or dates he can afford, which requires understanding and patience.
* **Lack of ""Firsts"":**¬†For someone who desires traditional relationship milestones, dating a divorced man means he has already experienced ""firsts"" like marriage, honeymoons, and the birth of a first child with someone else. This can lead to a feeling that your relationship isn't a ""complete"" union or is less special.
* **Commitment Issues (or Too Eager):**¬†Some recently divorced men may be hesitant to commit due to the trauma of the past, while others might rush into a new serious relationship too quickly as a way to find stability, without properly processing their feelings.
* **Legal entanglements (if not finalized):**¬†If the divorce is still in the process of being finalized (separated, not officially divorced), your relationship could complicate the legal proceedings, affect the settlement, or impact child custody arrangements.¬†",AsianLoveDoll,1760433892.0,1,1.0,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o6ar69/what_are_the_reasons_why_you_wouldnt_date_a/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o6ar69/what_are_the_reasons_why_you_wouldnt_date_a/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False

Then couple days later she posted a video on instagram her jiggling her boobies with her tongue out while asking should she get a butterfly tattoo on her boobies you can almost see the nipple when she did that. She normally ask and send it to me before posting something like that when she did without asking me it felt a bit off. So I told her you gotta take it down because it was uncomfortable and not respecting yourself. She told me to take mines down when I took a pic of me getting a cut and so I did it because I understood. And when I tell her to take hers down it got heated and comparing me I‚Äôm like one of those dudes she dated and messed with controlling.

1o6aim8,I've been in bad situations,"I‚Äôm a 30-year-old woman seeking advice and perspective about my current situation with my ex-boyfriend, 28, whom I‚Äôll call L. My romantic experiences have been challenging, and with L, I really thought he was the one‚ÄîI was faithful and truly believed we would marry. Despite this, he treated me terribly. He‚Äôs never apologized or shown any remorse or empathy for the pain he caused, even though I always admitted my mistakes and apologized when I was wrong.One of the worst experiences was discovering he cheated on me. While he was away in jail and treatment and I was using his phone because mine was broken, I received disturbing messages from two people whose numbers weren‚Äôt saved. After some investigation, I realized one was a woman (J) he‚Äôd slept with. She messaged not knowing I had his phone, saying, 'Why didn‚Äôt you tell me that before we hooked up in your truck where your girlfriend sits'‚Äîwhich felt cruel and humiliating.The other messages came from P, his friend S‚Äôs ex-girlfriend, who he was also involved with. She sent abusive messages, mocking my past traumas and telling me to kill myself. This left me devastated and alone while L was away. When he returned and I showed him the messages, he just deleted them and excused P‚Äôs behavior, saying she was bipolar, as if that explained everything.Currently, L is sober and living at an Oxford house, and he has a new girlfriend. I‚Äôm still living at his mom‚Äôs place because I have nowhere else to go and no support system aside from her. Even so, I find it hard to talk to her about things that bother me, so I keep it all inside.After breaking up with L, I met another guy‚ÄîA‚Äîwho seemed great at first and even moved in. He gained L‚Äôs mom‚Äôs approval, but after several months, he became mentally and emotionally abusive, constantly accusing me of cheating even though I rarely left the house. Eventually, the abuse turned physical and he was kicked out.

1o6ai5h,Still doesn't make sense,"I dated someone for 2 months from a dating app, it ended in early march, was my first time in some sort of extended dating situation. Whilst we had our small differences it seemed like we had potential to work together and a chemistry that I still haven't experienced since. She was suggesting date ideas and sending me cute messages close to the breakup, but all of sudden started to be distant one week, after being ignored for a day I received a long breakup text. It still really confuses me, she said she was ""struggling to be vulnerable"" and included phrases like ""I saw a future together"" ""closest to you than most everyone else"" ""This isn't a reflection of my feelings towards you"", followed by her saying she wasn't ready and never wants to see me again whilst she goes into therapy. I said I wanted to work with her whilst she is going through it and we can take our time with intimacy etc and she pretty much said no and she would never forgive herself for doing this to me. I told her I would give her space and check back in a month which I never received a reply to.

A month later, I sent her a text asking if she wanted to have an evening out and got a cold reply. I responded lightly then a few days later noticed her on dating apps. I spiraled and I sent her a rly long text saying I still deeply care about her and sorry if I did anything wrong that I wanted to give it another chance. I didn't get a reply, then over about a month or two I spiraled further sending her texts like once a week trying to understand what happened and if we could just talk. I eventually broke and sent a more serious text telling her its not fair to ignore me like this, that I'm still confused and hurt. More on this, I found out she was lying about her name which confused me even more, probably for protection I would assume but I don't understand why it would be hidden from me for so long. After being ignored for over a month I finally received a text saying ""Please don't message me again"".

I haven't texted her since but its been over 3 months since that and I still struggle everyday trying to comprehend what happened. It's obvious she doesn't want to be with me or at least talk to me. Everyone around me is annoyed whenever I bring up that I still feel for her, I feel like a creep sometimes obsessing this much over some person I barely knew. I don't know why but I still feel to my core that was my person but something got in the way. Most of everyday consists of me thinking of her and what happened, I just want to hear from her, have an actual conversation so I can find some peace :(",beautyofknowing,1760432921.0,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o6ai5h/still_doesnt_make_sense/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o6ai5h/still_doesnt_make_sense/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o6afk5,Pls How can I improve my life,"For context my ex (26M) and I (26F) broke up 3 years ago near the end of 2022. Right after he wanted to get back together and up to like September 2023 he stopped trying and then became cold and distant. I broke things off in June of 2024 and we‚Äôre still somewhat in contact. 

A main issue was that he became friends with his coworkers around 2020 and started prioritizing them. Like we‚Äôd be out and he‚Äôd pass by work to see who was there, he‚Äôd go on his days off. So he pretty much destroyed our relationship while he built all those. 

He‚Äôs been in that company since he started working at 19 so he‚Äôs been stable there. I on the other hand went to college and have been at around 8 jobs since I started working. So in 2023 I graduated, was unemployed and kinda lonely bc I no longer had the social aspect of school and shortly after graduating he was one of my sources of socializing and soon he just went cold on me.

When I broke things off I started reaching out to friends more and trying to build up my social life. And I saw my ex just glide into his bc he had been building his while he was destroying us. So since that 2024 break up he‚Äôs found a new friend group apart from his coworker friend group. So now he has more hangouts with them, birthday parties, trips. 

I‚Äôm still building mine. Honestly,I‚Äôm trying but I‚Äôm only almost a year in of having worked a full time job . I feel like i deepened some friendships more but i still feel lonely like I don‚Äôt have a friend group like my ex does. I‚Äôve found myself in more one on ones. I even tried joining a social group club but my most recent meet up was weird.

This past weekend my ex went on a birthday trip for his friend. And mind you there‚Äôs a lot of girls in that friend group with like 4 guys. The birthday girl posted a photo of my ex in the bathroom together ig in the morning when he was brushing his teeth‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm seeing him this weekend at my best friends sons birthday. 

My best friend and I also have a gc with him and he‚Äôs been sending messages there- that‚Äôs what I meant by we‚Äôre somewhat in touch.

Anyways I don‚Äôt know how to feel about that post I saw but I like just want to flip my life around. Like my ex just got a new car too, he has a social life. 

I thought about changing jobs to a new city. Idk please I‚Äôve been trying to get some positive change for so long and I feel like my exs life is the only one changing for better.

1o6a8cf,Ex and me are friends,"So me and my ex broke up back in June then in august we started talking again. We broke up because I accused her of cheating someone she works with causing drama and me feeding into her coworkers drama and her coworker reaching out to everyone in my family talking bad about my girlfriend. So a lot of outside drama and me not shutting it down and my sister disrespecting her and me not shutting that down killed our relationship. We started talking again back in august hanging out here and there etc. she told me she lost her job and is not looking for a relationship with anyone at this moment. She said she needs to rebuild herself and her situation before even thinking about one with anyone let alone me.. so we keep hanging out and I keep pushing the being more than friends thing etc. she hugs me she absolutely hates hugs from anyone but will hug me before I leave her place. Well one night she took me to her old neighborhood and went down her old memories growing up with her loved grandmother and it seemed her walls went down. Then later that night before I was leaving she and I finally talked about what happened in the past and everything that went down she said why didn‚Äôt you be the man and stand up for me etc and stand in my corner etc. even though that conversation wasn‚Äôt a good one we finally had it. I‚Äôm thinking we are building something trust something then she goes back into this walls up situation. Well tonight we hung out and just laughed talked etc she asked me my opinions on paint for her walls and she agreed with my choice and what scent to clean her floors with and she agreed and then we filed a report for her stolen dog and she kept saying my partner etc she said I never took you off and won‚Äôt take you off secondary custody for his location chip. But she said I‚Äôm a great guy and all of that and yeah it felt like we were getting somewhere again. She even said it was nice having you here tonight I felt safe secured and your presence was nice.

Before we broke up, we had already planned a week off work to spend together. Despite the breakup, she still wants me to visit and spend that week with her.

Right now, I‚Äôm still hurting ‚Äî and she knows that. Part of me feels it might not be the best idea to go, but another part of me wants to see her for this week and then communicate to her that I need some time and space.

1o69vdr,Navigating guilt and extreme sadness,"Posting a lot on this subreddit but it‚Äôs the only alternative to either texting my ex or calling my friends (which I try and avoid when I‚Äôm supposed to be at work for obvious reasons).

For context, my ex and I broke up (I ended it) because I had become deeply unhappy both with the relationship dynamic (arguing, raised voices, him accusing me of ruining special occasions when I voiced something I was unhappy with etc) and the fact that our aspirations for the future seemed to be splintering off in different directions.

I still love him and care for him deeply but I completely lost myself. I was desperate to make him happy and much of my thoughts were consumed with wondering whether or not he was happy, whether he was lying about going certain places or seeing certain people and why he didn‚Äôt seem to care about my happiness (at one point even admitting that although he knew it could be done relatively easily, he just wasn‚Äôt that kind of person). 

We were together for 5 years and I don‚Äôt know adult life without him, having started dating him not long after my previous relationship ended and me still being a teenager at the time. 

I was hoping for advice on how to cope with the guilt you may feel after ending a long-term relationship and hurting someone you care about. I am going through a particularly rough patch now (a month and a bit later) and I‚Äôm consumed by the concern that he‚Äôs upset and that I‚Äôve blindsided him and he hates me. I know I shouldn‚Äôt worry about him now it‚Äôs over and that he has his own network of friends who will support him but ultimately emotionally, I was most proactive in asking him how he was doing and being there for him. I know he can handle it but it‚Äôs his first breakup and I feel so so evil for doing this to him (even though I‚Äôm suffering myself). 

If any AFAB individuals have read to the end, I would also appreciate any advice on navigating a breakup on your period. This feeling was brought about by my ex texting me about something miscellaneous and telling me he‚Äôd cry if he saw me and although this was a few days ago I‚Äôm still crying on and off and can‚Äôt face other people. 

Any advice would be so appreciated because I‚Äôm not sure how much longer I can go on feeling this way if nothing changes.

1o69u74,My ex boyfriend [32 M] just confessed to me [32 F] that he slept with prostitutes while we were in a relationship,"This is not a post I ever thought I‚Äôd write. Not something I thought would happen to me. 

I broke up with my now ex in September. Made the mistake of starting to hookup with him last week. This past Saturday we are at brunch and he tells me that he tested negative for STDs. Mind you he had told me that he had slept with one person once since we had broken up. I was confused by this because he said he used protection. Didn‚Äôt trust his answer. I‚Äôm about to leave to go see one of my favorite artists in concert (he knows this) and I ask if there‚Äôs anything else he wants to tell me. 

He asks to sit in my car with me, tells me he cheated in July when we were together. Said it happened once with a chick he met at a concert. He had told me a few weeks ago that he has gone to a sex club. Then told me it was a lie. Then on Saturday says it was the truth that he did sleep with 1 person at the sex club. He says there‚Äôs nothing else to tell me that he‚Äôs lied about. 

Fast forward to yesterday. I text him that I think he hasn‚Äôt only slept with 2 people since we broke up.  there‚Äôs more he‚Äôs not telling me. He eventually says there is something he wants to tell me. But he is addressing it in therapy. I push him to just tell me. He tries to ask to tell me in person. I push back and say to tell me over the phone. 

I will note one thing- I had a sense that he had cheated on me in July. I has called him, told him this and he reassured me nothing had happened. At this time he hasn‚Äôt done or said anything to lead me to believe he had cheated. It was just a gut instinct. 

A few hours ago he tells me that in July he slept with a chick it a concert. Goes to Warped Tour in Long Beach. Convinces himself Im going to breakup with him (I don‚Äôt even know he had cheated).

He then tells me he has all this pent up frustration. So he looks for a strip club. Goes there and finds out it‚Äôs a brothel. Proceeds to sleep with 3 women, 2 women he takes back to his hotel where he does cocaine with them. Has sex with them. 

Also 2 weeks prior to me ending our relationship, he hired someone to come to his house for sex. He told me all of this to ‚Äúbuild trust.‚Äù That‚Äôs his own words that Im quitting. I have cried, screamed, felt numb. I was in this relationship for almost 2 years. I‚Äôve never in my life been deceived like this before.

1o69r8u,Got dumped by my girlfriend for her male bestie,"Hey everyone,
I‚Äôm a 24M, and I was in a long-distance relationship with my ex for almost 3 years. We had an amazing bond great emotional connection, great chemistry, even our sex life was perfect whenever we met. From the start, she had a male best friend. I wasn‚Äôt comfortable with it initially, but I accepted it because I didn‚Äôt want to be controlling. Things went really well for about 2.5 years.At the beginning of this year, I lost a family member and went into a bad depressive phase. I wasn‚Äôt myself for a while. During that time, her ‚Äúmale best friend‚Äù went to meet her. Later, I found out that they stayed together for 3 days in the same hotel and same room. I didn‚Äôt know any of this back then I only found out after our breakup.

After that, things started going downhill. She said I wasn‚Äôt emotionally available and started blaming me for everything. Around July, she came home for 10‚Äì15 days and became distant. She stopped calling, barely texted, but was online late at night. When I asked, she said she was busy with family. A few weeks later, she broke up with me over text, said I ruined her happiness, deleted all our pictures and videos, and blocked me everywhere.I accepted the breakup, but I wasn‚Äôt over her. I asked a few of her friends what she was up to and that‚Äôs when I found out the truth. She was on late-night video calls, going out with that same guy, and even stayed in OYO with him for 3 days before coming home in September. Apparently, they‚Äôd been seeing each other since March basically, she‚Äôd been cheating since the time I was fighting depression. It broke me. If she wanted to be with him, she could‚Äôve just been honest and ended things. Instead, she slept with another guy and lied to my face. I keep replaying everything in my head, trying to understand how someone I loved so deeply could change like that. She works in an IT company in Bangalore, and I don‚Äôt know what changed maybe the environment, or maybe she just decided she wanted something else. But it hurts knowing she could sleep next to another guy while still being in a relationship with me. Even after two months, I still catch myself checking her profile or asking about her. I can‚Äôt seem to hate her, no matter how much I try. I stayed loyal and gave my best, but apparently, loyalty doesn‚Äôt mean much anymore. I‚Äôm slowly realizing she‚Äôs not the same person I fell for. I didn‚Äôt lose her she lost someone who was real, loyal, and stood by her even at his lowest. I‚Äôm focusing on myself now the gym, my career, and my peace. But some days still hurt like hell.

Just wanted to get this off my chest.

TL;DR: Was in a 3-year long-distance relationship. Lost a family member, went into depression. During that time my girlfriend cheated on me with her male best friend, lied, and then dumped me blaming me for everything.

1o69r4a,Will my ex come back? Feeling confused and need advice,"
Hi everyone,
I‚Äôm going through a really confusing situation and would appreciate some honest advice. My ex and I broke up in late August. Since then, we‚Äôve had some physical contact (most recently in late September), and he‚Äôs shown multiple signs that he misses me. He‚Äôs commented on things like missing our time together, my cooking, and even small intimate moments.

Communication has been inconsistent: he responds briefly to practical messages, checks my stories, but rarely initiates meaningful contact. But always says hey or somthing in the moment when he sees me in college (like when I forgot somthingin my car). On top of that, some rumors about me have reached him, which have affected his trust. He‚Äôs mentioned that he probably could never fully trust me again, and that might limit the possibility of restarting.

He also says he misses me and cares about me, but at the same time, he‚Äôs hesitant and doesn‚Äôt want to create false hope. I feel like there‚Äôs still something there physically and emotionally, but it‚Äôs unclear if it‚Äôs lust, nostalgia, or genuine feelings.

I‚Äôm trying to figure out: is there a realistic chance he might come back, or should I accept that it‚Äôs over? How have you handled situations like this? Any insights or similar experiences would really help me make sense of it.

1o69mhe,Is there a chance?,"Around three weeks ago my girlfriend of 3.5 years broke up with me. I saw her drifting away for the last month‚Äôs but she‚Äôs quite bad in speaking her emotions and it was hard for me to fix it. She said she lost her feelings but still misses and loves me.

During the breakup itself she cried and she wasn‚Äôt sure it was the right decision but she felt like she had to make it, during this time she also said that she‚Äôs not doing well mentally.

In the next three weeks she texted me several times, she said she still loves me and misses me and she looked on her phone if I messaged her everyday. She also asked me if I behaved when I went out for drinks with my mates. After three weeks of texting I told her I think it‚Äôs best for her not to contact me for a while to see if she‚Äôs truly missing me which she (I think) didn‚Äôt like too much but she understood.

I spoke to her one more time afterwards and I told her that I took it quite hard. While I also lost my feelings for a while after the breakup they came back stronger and I realised that I also wasn‚Äôt the best partner. She didn‚Äôt think I would be so upset about the breakup as she thought this was also what I wanted.

Anyways she said I couldn‚Äôt convince her NOW and that for the time being she think it‚Äôs the best choice, but she‚Äôs not 100% sure if it‚Äôs the right choice in the end. She told one of my mates girlfriends that she think it‚Äôs over for good but to me her signals are quite unclear. She said that she doesn‚Äôt want me to give me false hope.

She also thinks that we are quite incompatible about a lot of thinks but she doesn‚Äôt make too much of an effort into them, something that I said to her would probably be the same with a new partner.

For now I have started no contact with her and told her it‚Äôs probably best for her to not contact me if she‚Äôs unsure as I don‚Äôt want to be friends with her. She understood and won‚Äôt contact me for a while.

Do you guys think there is still a chance? I told her I believe our differences are quite solvable and that feelings come and go. For context we already broke up around 2.5 years ago for around 2 weeks, we both are quite similar in character.

I also asked her to meet up in person one more time to speak about it, but she declined. Knowing her I think she‚Äôs afraid to catch feelings again but that‚Äôs guess work.

Edit: for context I‚Äôm 27 and she‚Äôs 24. Lately she hasn‚Äôt been interested in a lot of things (for example she doesn‚Äôt like her hobby‚Äôs anymore) I think she‚Äôs not doing well in that way she also said that she‚Äôs changed since our start of the relationship.",Tempariar,1760429480.0,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o69mhe/is_there_a_chance/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o69mhe/is_there_a_chance/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o69kzr,My experience with my avoidant ex-the most heartbreaking breakup,"I (26M) was with my ex (30F) for five months this past summer. She dumped me via text after what, to everyone on the outside and to me, looked like an incredibly loving and passionate relationship.

I‚Äôd heard the term avoidant before, but never paid much attention‚Äîuntil now.

We met on a dating app and had one of those first dates where everything just clicks. We talked for hours, the waitress had to keep reminding us to order, and before I knew it, the bar was empty. I thought I might‚Äôve found ‚Äúthe one.‚Äù

Looking back, she warned me early on: ‚ÄúI can be cold and aloof.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt realize how true that was. The typical avoidant traits were all there‚Äîhyper-independent, constantly busy, and emotionally guarded‚Äîbut I mistook them for green flags. She‚Äôd been in one long-term relationship (eight years) and since then said she struggled to find something that felt real. Another red flag I missed.

Our bond deepened fast. She told me she loved me, and I felt the same. We never fought‚Äînot once‚Äîwhich I thought was strange. When our first conflict finally happened, I made a mistake that upset her, but it also exposed something she didn‚Äôt want me to see. No one was really at fault, and I thought we could grow from it. Instead, she began gaslighting and snapping at me, something I‚Äôd never expected from her.

It calmed down, and I thought we‚Äôd moved on. I even took her to meet my family it was a great trip. But shortly after, I made one harmless joke, and that was it. She blew up, twisted the situation, and used it as her excuse to end things.

For a woman in her 30s to dump someone she claimed to love and who she was planning to move in with via text was shocking. I‚Äôd been broken up with before, but never with so little empathy.

I lashed out in confusion and called her a narcissist (not realizing I was close to the truth). After two weeks of no contact, I caved and reached out. She breadcrumbed me‚Äîapologized for a few things, said she wanted to meet up, even admitted she was scared I‚Äôd seen ‚Äúthe real her.‚Äù Then the walls went right back up, and she offered me friendship.

That second rejection hurt even more. I couldn‚Äôt believe someone could go from ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù to ‚Äúlet‚Äôs be friends‚Äù in just a few weeks.

After that, I declined the friendship and said goodbye. The next day, I started researching and found this subreddit. Reading others‚Äô stories helped me see I‚Äôm not alone.

This was by far the most traumatic breakup I‚Äôve ever experienced‚Äîeven more than my previous six-year relationship. The confusion, anxiety, and emotional whiplash have been unreal. It‚Äôs changed how I see relationships, people, and even myself.

There were so many other red flags I didn't even mention. She called her parents by their first names not mom or dad. Her father used to number her boyfriends Dead boy #1 dead boy #2 and so on. She also used to say out loud ""I'm a nice person"" and I would say yeah I know you are. But one day she said it and it hit me that actually nice and good people don't usually have to say that out loud. 

Thanks to everyone here who took the time to read this. ",Glyphh,1760429310.0,2,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o69kzr/my_experience_with_my_avoidant_exthe_most/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o69kzr/my_experience_with_my_avoidant_exthe_most/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o69kqa,"Still wondering after 11 years, is it normal? Should I reach out or let it go?","I had a girlfriend back in college in first year, and we were in a live-in relationship for about a year. The breakup was sudden, and I never really got a reason why she ended things. I tried reaching out a few times over the years, but she never replied or picked up my calls. I even tried talking to her friends and sister as they also know me but no answers.

It‚Äôs been 11 years now. I‚Äôve dated since then, but she still crosses my mind sometimes maybe because it was the first love. I was thinking about sending her a friend request or message just to say hi - not to get back together, but maybe just to be on peaceful terms.

Would that be a mistake after all this time, especially knowing she‚Äôs ignored me before? Or is it better to leave it completely in the past?

Has anyone felt the same ever?

1o69k24,i love and miss her so much and i hate that i do,"we‚Äôre both 17, and she broke up with me about a month ago. i normally dont do relationships, in the sense that id rather keep to myself and have my peace and quiet. but something about this woman is different, and no matter how objectively i try to look at how things really were, i just feel like shes the one still. building up to when she left me, i was dealing with personal issues with my father, and bottom line is, i was extremely hurt by him after a huge argument and i asked her for reassurance more often from her. looking back, it maybe came off as not trusting her, and i wish i could‚Äôve said things differently. then, the final tipping point, was the night of homecoming.

we go to neighboring high schools, and we decided to go to hers for homecoming instead of mine since ours were happening the same night. i really bit off more than i can chew, though. normally, im totally fine in large and loud social situations, but this was different. everything was so overwhelming, and i felt like i was ready to collapse and break down. she kept on going up to her friends and talking to them, and im not the kind of guy to like force myself into a conversation if i dont know the people, so i chose to step back whenever she did that. eventually, i felt completely overwhelmed. i knew literally nobody there except for her and a handful of mutual friends, and i really wanted to step out to breathe because i felt like i was going to break down. i expressed this to her, but she shrugged it off, and walked off with her best friend. i felt so hurt and shut off, and i decided to walk away and sit outside on the curb for a couple of minutes to collect myself, which i deeply regret. the day after, she dumped me. she told me it hurt her feelings when i walked off, and she wants me to work on myself and my confidence ever since that tanked after that big argument with my dad. she said she wants her relationships to be happy, and having the stress of me not being the best mentally was too much for her to handle, and she needed a break. ive been giving her the space, but part of me feels like deep down shes not coming back. tonights been especially bad, and i have no idea why. i miss her more than ever, i thought i was getting over her slowly, but i really miss her. i miss how beautiful her heart and soul were, i miss the memories we shared, even if they weren‚Äôt the best, i miss her qualities, i miss her flaws, i miss holding her hand and embracing her, i miss seeing the most beautiful woman in the entire world, i miss the love. i want to text her, but im scared to, and i feel so lost. ive tried everything i can to move on, and at the end of the day, i just cant.",No-Comfort-5780,1760429206.0,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o69k24/i_love_and_miss_her_so_much_and_i_hate_that_i_do/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o69k24/i_love_and_miss_her_so_much_and_i_hate_that_i_do/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False

1o69fnt,Now I know why she left so quickly out of nowhere. She was cheating on me.,"2 and a half years we were together. Friends for about 2 years before. I never expected her to do something like that. I‚Äôve never been so vulnerable with someone in my life. And she took advantage of it.

It‚Äôs been a few months since she left me, and things aren‚Äôt any better. I accidentally saw a picture of her smiling with her new better boyfriend. It killed something inside me. Why wasn‚Äôt I enough? Why have I never been enough for anyone?

All I‚Äôve ever wanted in life was to be loved by a woman. I‚Äôve never had any dreams or aspirations in life. The only thing I knew I wanted since I was a kid, was for a woman to love me as a man. For a while it felt like my dream came true. But it all crashed down.

Now I have nothing. She was the only reason I was even staying alive in the first place. Now I‚Äôm just a 28 year old fat ugly guy who still lives with his mom and can‚Äôt even drive a car. I have no reason to keep living. There‚Äôs not one woman out there who would want me. And even if there is, she‚Äôll just cheat on me like the last one.

Why even bother anymore. The best of days have long past, and now I‚Äôll only continue to find that there‚Äôs always a worse day. The hole is getting deeper. It‚Äôs getting darker. I can‚Äôt see any light anymore. I have nothing to offer any woman. I‚Äôm beyond worthless.

1o69cnx,"I couldn‚Äôt fit my boyfriends d**k inside of me, so he dumped me","I (27f) and my EX bf (27m) broke up after having sex with me as he couldn‚Äôt put his whole d**k in.

We were together for almost two years. We had a really strong bond, we laughed a lot, got along well, and built so many memories together. But our s*x life was always something that caused issues.

I‚Äôve always had some health problems down there that made sex painful at times. Sometimes I‚Äôd get tears or need breaks, and my boyfriend is someone with a very high s*x drive. At first, he was understanding, and I tried everything I could to make him feel satisfied, like more oral or finding other ways of being intimate, but even when we had s*x multiple times in a week, he never seemed fully content.

Eventually, the lack of constant s*x started to make him frustrated. He‚Äôd say things like I wasn‚Äôt flirty enough or that I didn‚Äôt compliment him enough compared to how his friends hyped him up. Once, when he was drunk, he told me I didn‚Äôt excite him, didn‚Äôt flirt enough and that I had no emotional intelligence. That one really stuck with me.

I‚Äôve always been a respectful girlfriend. I never disrespected him, insulted him, or crossed his boundaries. I always asked before doing anything I thought might make him uncomfortable, like even asking if he was okay with me staying at a friend‚Äôs place. But when it came to my boundaries, he didn‚Äôt always offer the same respect. He once invited a female friend he‚Äôd had a sexual past with to stay at his house, even though I had already told him that situation made me uncomfortable. But because they were now best friends and that history was a drunken night, it wasn‚Äôt something that he thought mattered anymore.

Then a few months ago, I saw messages between him and another girl. The tone was definitely flirty, playful and suggestive from her end, even though he claimed it was just banter. Later, he admitted it was flirting but said he didn‚Äôt realise it at the time. He told me maybe he‚Äôd started talking like that because he was getting more of the flirty energy and validation from her that he didn‚Äôt get from me.

When we finally broke up, it was right after I asked him to be gentle during s*x because I‚Äôd recently healed from a tear. Instead, he told me he couldn‚Äôt keep doing this, that he felt something missing between us, and that he worried he‚Äôd eventually cross a line with someone else unconditionally.

I‚Äôm heartbroken. I feel so betrayed because I loved and respected him deeply, and I gave everything I could within my limits. I just don‚Äôt understand how someone can walk away like that, not because of a lack of love or respect, but because I couldn‚Äôt physically or emotionally(flirting) match some unrealistic level of excitement he needed all the time.",Alternative-Bar3934,1760428398.0,26,0.77,36,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o69cnx/i_couldnt_fit_my_boyfriends_dk_inside_of_me_so_he/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o69cnx/i_couldnt_fit_my_boyfriends_dk_inside_of_me_so_he/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False

1o691j6,My ex claims she is very happy w her new bf and he treats her great - but is this true based on her actions?,"2 weeks ago my ex of 1.5 years, who now lives an hour away was in town and drunk called me at a club as well as liked a shirtless picture i recently sent her, wearing boxers she bought me. When i picked up she made small talk and then said ‚Äúnever mind‚Äù and hung up. But it was cute. Up until that point i‚Äôve been trying to win her back for about a month and have been ignored the whole time.

She has a current bf and they prob have been together 2-3 months. He‚Äôs already taken her on a nice vacation. Which sucked to see. After she called me, i texted her to come to a fall fest event and gave her the dates. Well she ends up being there with a group of friends - boyfriend left behind (2 hrs away). She didnt tell me she was going but we happened to bump into each other which is rare because its a big bar crawl type of event. Immediately we start talking, she is smiling, holding my hand. I asked if she misses me and she says ‚Äúmaybeeee‚Äù. Eventually i put my arm around her telling her how i feel about her and kissing her on the cheek and forehead multiple times. Saying sweet things in her ear. Shes looking in my eyes and smiling the whole time. We talk for over an hour. She claims she is happy with her boyfriend and that i should find someone else. Then she goes home and makes a social media post the next day about making dinner with her bf. I do love her and want to be w her badly.

1o68zi4,"""My [21M] fairytale start with [22F] ended in a breakup, and I'm not sure what to do now.""","On a certain day, to be precise, 13th November 2023, we had a function in college for Ethnic Day. All the students wore Indian attire, and she did too. She [21F] wore a black saree with flower designs and a red blouse. I [20M] usually notice girls with long hair, but even though she didn't have long hair, I fell for her instantly. I didn't tell anyone, and time went by.
After 3-4 months (I hadn't seen her since), one day my friend [20M] was looking at his crush's [20F] group photo on Instagram, and there she was, beautiful as always. That's when I told my friends about her, and some of them tried to set us up.
On 7th March 2024, a Thursday, my friend [20M] and I were standing in front of the college when he suddenly said, ""There she is."" I saw her going home. The next day was a holiday, followed by Saturday and Sunday, so she was going home. My friend told me, ""Go talk to her, man, now's your chance."" Since she was alone, I made up my mind and went after her. When I caught up, I said, ""Excuse me. Hi, you have a beautiful smile, and that saree you wore, you were beautiful."" She smiled and asked, ""Why are you telling me this... mostly now?"" to that I was like, ""You always travel with your friends, but now I saw you alone, so I took the opportunity. That's all."" I said goodbye and left.
On Tuesday, 12th March 2024, in the evening, I went to propose on the 4th floor of the college block. I had planned everything, but when she saw me, I was just a nervous guy. She told me to calm down. It felt like an eternity. Finally, I made a move and said, ""You know what? I'm here to say, I think I love you."" After a pause, she replied, ""I don't know anything about you. Now, let's get to know each other, then I'll tell you"".
After that, I blacked out for two days emotionally. I didn't talk to her or send a follow request. I remember she did everything‚Äîlike sending the follow request, messaging, and even initiating what felt like a first date‚Äîdespite her not liking to take the initiative.
Then, on Saturday, 23rd March 2024, she reached out and we went to a restaurant. It felt like an invite, sort of like a first date, but her friends were with her, and I brought a friend along too. After all that, I sat beside her on the bus to return to college. Normally, the 30-minute ride feels long, but that day, it felt like only 5 minutes.
Later that night, at around 12:03 AM, she said, ""I ‚ù§Ô∏è you"" in a different style. My legs were shaking, and my hands were cold. She said she had similar feelings, and it's still continuing.

I had been communicating some small issues I had with him but he was determined to work through them and as far as I was aware he didn‚Äôt have any problems with me.

But he also said he had only been thinking about it since the last day he saw me and it seems weird to end a 2 year relationship after thinking about it for less than a week. 

Anyway he told me I didn‚Äôt do anything wrong and he wished me the best. Now 2 months later he‚Äôs reposting very contradictory things.

1o68mkk,How to deal with a fearful avoidant,"Hi,

I need some REAL advice and not all of that ‚Äúrun‚Äù advice.

I was dating this girl for 7 months and she was very confused because she did really like me and thought i was perfect for her but it‚Äôs like her body wont let her surrender to me because she‚Äôs afraid. She has always chased guys that was very avoidant and that treated her wrong. Anyways, we broke it off because things was just not working.

2 months after the ‚Äúbreakup‚Äù she contacted me again saying she misses me and that i‚Äôm perfect for her but she is really afraid. I truly believe her because she‚Äôs a very honest person and not the typical avoidant type. I don‚Äôt have the most healthy attachment style too - but I definetly know that if I were to change it for anyone it would be her. This is not just me trying to get what I can‚Äôt have because trust me i‚Äôm a very reflected person. I believe this bond and deepness we have is on another level and unlike anything i‚Äôve tried with anyone. Maybe only my convos with my mom comes close. The Girl and my relationship has never been toxic in any way and we have never been fighting and we share all the same values.

She is now realizing that all of this is her attachment style and that might be why she is the way she is and is willing to work on it because she wants a healthy relationship with me.

I guess my question is - do any of you have any sort of experience with all this?

What can i expect? Is it realisticly possible for us to have a future? How do you change this?

1o68kd7,Ex fiance that I still live with is being a bit toxic?,"So we broke up about a week ago now after 8 years right after we had only been in our new place for not even a month right as I'm literally finally on track to fixing a bunch of shit in my life. I've already basically accepted this and I'm sitting here trying to give her space while we still have to see eachother. I'm not looking at her as much and I'm not wondering who she is talking to or where she is going. But tonight and last night she'll sit in the living room with me and our roommates and text all these people I'm assuming and just be giggling here and there and every now and then she looks at me. I'm very chill about everything because I sort of saw it coming and was thinking about leaving her myself. But tonight when I left to the store walking kinda late she was all up my ass about it. Even texted me saying. ""Be fr this is going to affect my decision"" girl be so honest affect your decision on what? You already broke up with me. Sure I want her back and I want to work on things but the more she does this shit the more I can't wait to be away from her and find my peace. I had issues in our relationship sure but so did she and now it's at this point where it's like I was the issue and she really thinks she still controls me. Told me she might be going out tonight with a big ass smile on her face. I literally didn't have anything to say. I'm thinking""cool stay safe"" but I don't even wanna give her that. Hope she finds herself and is fine being alone because Lord knows I will be no matter what happens. I will be anywhere in life even in a coma and I will have peace knowing her toxic ass is not fucking with my peace playing these dumbass games so many women do. I don't know what she wants from me? If she wants me to go off on her or if she wants me to beg her to stop or what. Thing is I wanna do both of those things.

1o67b8v,Posting to vent,"They were abusive the whole time, but I feel good now. My partner gave me an ultimatum to discuss our politics during our first couples therapy session saying ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt want to talk about this at our session, I don‚Äôt want to do this anymore. I‚Äôm done‚Äù. I had called them to say good night, and they were suddenly yelling at me to delete something I posted to my story thinking it was political (it had nothing to do with politics). It didn‚Äôt make sense to start discussing a brand new (nonexistent) issue when we haven‚Äôt addressed the old ones. It also doesn‚Äôt make sense to give the supposed ‚Äúloved of your life‚Äù an ultimatum in the first place. I don‚Äôt even care about politics, so I feel like it was just to start a new argument, deflect past issues etc. I was tired of constantly arguing, and honestly didn‚Äôt want to hear it. And so I told them to cancel the appointment if that‚Äôs the case because talking about it was becoming exhausting. They told me when to exchange belongings and that was that. 
Strange considering this person damaged my car, damaged my laptops, swung a bat at me, threatened me with a knife, and trapped me in their apartment when they didn‚Äôt want me to leave during previous manic/psychotic episodes. But it was the easiest chance I‚Äôve ever gotten to leave, so I didn‚Äôt hesitate to take it. Someone who can‚Äôt go a day without complaining or being negative, whose idea of peace is chaos and whose idea of chaos is peace, was only going to continue making my life miserable. 
By the end, I really saw 0 benefits in dating them. They only added problems and stress to my life, they weren‚Äôt affectionate, they weren‚Äôt nice, all throughout the relationship they made me feel as though everything I did was wrong. They hit me. They destroyed expensive equipment I still haven‚Äôt paid off, and that I needed for my creative passion, they complained about how I slept, how I ate, how I cleaned, how I dressed, how often or how long I would use the bathroom, my hobbies, my work, literally everything. They would treat me like a leper when I would try to touch them. They would gaslight me into thinking I had bad memory telling me to record disputes, then when recordings proved me right, I was told they no longer like the idea of recording because I only use the recordings against them, apparently. This became a common trend with any ‚Äúadvice‚Äù they‚Äôd give me to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù in the relationship. 
Honestly I really don‚Äôt know why I stayed so long. I guess I was hoping things would eventually go back to the first 6months we were together. I kept thinking maybe I wasn‚Äôt doing enough or working hard enough. That maybe if I found success, a better living situation would magically transform them into the person they pretended to be when they wanted to manipulate me into doing what they wanted. The whole relationship sucked, and looking back the good only felt so good because they gave me such horrible anxiety about their reactions.

1o67ao9,Anxious attachment,"I learned early that love 
could vanish mid-sentence‚Äî
a slammed door, a voice gone cold,
a silence that stretched long enough
to make me think it was my fault.

So I became a warning system
in human form.
I studied faces for danger,
tone shifts for rejection.
I learned to say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine‚Äù
so no one would leave faster.

When you grow up like that,
your body forgets what calm feels like.
Closeness feels like fire‚Äî
warm, but always one spark from burning you.
So you hold it too tight,
try to control it,
mistake anxiety for connection.

It isn‚Äôt brokenness,
it‚Äôs adaptation‚Äî

where safety was never guaranteed.

1o679rk,My girlfriend broke up with me and I feel like I hate my life ever since,"Like the title says, she broke up with me a few days ago. It feels like it came out of nowhere, I thought things were going well but she began to have days where she would feel off and couldn't figure out why, we talked a few times and came to the realization that the honeymoon phase was over, there was not as much passion and excitement. Which is fair, we dated for a little more than year, we agreed that that was part of any long term relationship. Then last week she said we need to talk and told me that she just didn't feel the same way she feel anymore and realized that maybe she didn't like me as much as she liked dating someone and that it was better if we broke off. I didn't argue with that, it's her decision and I only want to be with her if she wants to, but I still love her. I mean she was my world, she was comfort and warm, I truly wanted to build a future together and she told me the same thing, it really felt like she loved me but now I guess she doesn't. Needless to say that this has been devastating to me, it all happen so abruptly, the next day she drove by my place to exchange stuff we had of each other and there was such coldness, she gave me a small hug and there was barely any words exchanged, I guess that's when it really dawned on me that she doesn't love me anymore. Just the day before breaking up we were at a cafe we frequent for small jazz concerts like we did every week, we were embracing each other and kissing here and there, I would have never imagined that she would break up with me the next day. 
So yeah, my life feels so off right now, nothing feels right, like I'm in a nightmare I can't wake up from, like I somehow fell into a different reality that is not my own, like this was not meant to happen like this but it did. 
I don't know what I want from posting this, I guess I just need someone to listen, I don't really want to talk about this to any of my friends cause I'm afraid they'll see me as a burden and leave me too.

1o678d8,Do I send a Happy Birthday text or is it wiser to just let it rest?,"(Just a heads up, this is like a 4 minute read. About 7 minutes if you wanna read the 3 comments I left, they just have extra context to the story. But any and all advice or input would be incredibly appreciated, thank you in advance)

So I‚Äôm 18 and she‚Äôs also turning 18 in just a couple days. Our relationship ended 3¬Ω months ago and we‚Äôve been no-contact for almost 3, but her birthday is coming up very shortly here and I‚Äôd be lying if I said it wasn‚Äôt on my mind.

We went no-contact because when we initially broke up, nothing had really changed and we were still talking a lot. Not as much as before, but definitely still a whole lot more than normal friends do. Still sending tons of reels to each other n shit, things just weren‚Äôt really changing even though we had broken up already, and I told her we had to actually separate in order to separate ykwim? If I was still her go-to guy, she wouldn‚Äôt bother finding anyone else and recovering. Anyway, things unfortunately ended on a sour note a few days later and we went full no-contact, she had blocked me on social medias and everything so I took that as her finally understanding my earlier sentiment of moving on, even if the way she took it was a little extreme. Something to keep in mind is that we both initially wanted to stay friends, neither of us wanted to just stop talking, but we knew things had to change.

And since then we haven‚Äôt spoken a word. I sent her sister a text just over a month after the breakup explaining that I needed to unfollow her family, not because I had any problems with them or anything, but just because I couldn‚Äôt keep seeing her on my feed. I was going through a really rough patch for a while there and I just couldn‚Äôt. (another thing to note is that she unfollowed all of my family as well when she blocked me, not something I‚Äôm sour about, in fact I get it because I did the same, I just waited longer because I didn‚Äôt want to ruin my relationship with her family, they were super cool) Now should I have just done something like that quietly, maybe, honestly I probably should have, I think it probably came across as self righteous or ‚Äúshe unfollowed us so I‚Äôm gonna do the same hah‚Äù but I really was just struggling and couldn‚Äôt keep seeing them on my phone.

Point is, I haven‚Äôt had anything to do with her for 3¬Ω months and the last I texted her sister was 2 months ago. And tbh if her birthday was just a few more months out I would have no qualms sending a simple ‚ÄúHappy birthday [Name] üéà‚Äù but the fact of the matter is that I question whether it‚Äôs just too soon to do so. I don‚Äôt want to reopen old wounds just because I wanted to wish her a happy birthday, especially considering that I‚Äôm not wanting to do this with intent to reignite our old relationship, but just because I miss having her as a friend and don‚Äôt want her thinking I hate her now, ykwim?",Or1Guy_24,1760420289.0,1,1.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o678d8/do_i_send_a_happy_birthday_text_or_is_it_wiser_to/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o678d8/do_i_send_a_happy_birthday_text_or_is_it_wiser_to/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o671oi,Ex-gf insults me every now and then‚Ä¶,"I need emotional help and picker-upper from Reddit. 

Long story short: I (34M) broke up with my exgf (28F) about 4-5 months ago. Reasons were basically I didn‚Äôt see a future with her as my wife and basically started checking out of the relationship. When I broke up, she didn‚Äôt take it well and it was a little messy at that time. I felt very guilty at the time and still do, so it hurt me a lot to see hurt basically. 

We had a long NC, I respected completely, but every so often she found an ‚Äúexcuse‚Äù to write to me about something meaningless and I tended to just acknowledge but not give way to continue talking. I wasn‚Äôt rude but didn‚Äôt try and lead on, but this happened a good 5-6 times in the last couple of months, including her saying her best friend (who lived on another country and I never met) was coming to visit her and still wanted to meet me (despite the breakup, weird I know). 

Today: she reached again about something trivial, and made a comment that she found out from a source that I had a new gf and wanted to know who she was (I‚Äôve gone out but haven‚Äôt even had a kiss since we broke up). I, albeit sarcastically, said ‚Äúyour sources are incredible‚Äù and shrugged it off to which she completely went all out.

She said no woman will ever be happy with me because I‚Äôm a egocentric child, basically said I never pleased her in bed, basically said I was an unhappy man and she wished I died. 

So I get it, she‚Äôs still hurt and overreacted but fuck everything and hearing it hurts so much and makes me feel like shit. I wasn‚Äôt perfect but never have I ever disrespected her. I decided this was the final straw and blocked her on everything, no desire to acknowledge her again with her attitude, but fuck I‚Äôm so deep in my own fragile ego and confidence from this that I can‚Äôt stop this from hurting me or even believing that I don‚Äôt deserve anybody and I am the worst man and bf ever. 

I just need a pick me up because today this sunk me so deep, I feel like shit, and I don‚Äôt even understand why. At least letting it off may help, thank you Reddit.

1o66rl8,Feeling stuck after cheating and my ex immediately getting with my friend the next day,"Hey, I‚Äôm 16 and I really need to get this off my chest. I‚Äôm struggling so much with a breakup that happened about five months ago, and I feel completely stuck.

I cheated on my girlfriend. I didn‚Äôt mean to, but it happened. I was tempted, overthinking things, and ended up making the choice to tell her what happened as soon as I went home after seeing this girl, and broke up with her a couple of days later. I even told her she deserved someone better, thinking it was the right thing, but it still haunts me. I regret it so much, and I know I messed up. 

The worst part is what happened right after. A day or two after, if not then maybe not even a week  after we broke up, I found out she started seeing one of my friends ‚Äî someone I‚Äôve been close to since freshman year. We had been friends for years, and I feel completely betrayed. Even though he told her she should break up with me, it still feels like a huge betrayal. It all happened in the same week, and I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it.

We had so many plans together. We talked about writing letters, making bucket lists, planning the future, even being intimate. We even talked about losing our virginity to each other. Now I can‚Äôt stop imagining her doing all of that with him ‚Äî probably already has. Every memory of us laughing, hugging, talking, or being close comes back constantly, like a loop.
It‚Äôs especially painful because she went from crying in my arms and worrying about me, to acting like an entirely different person almost instantly. One day she‚Äôs upset with me, the next she‚Äôs gone and telling me she found someone else. I‚Äôll never forget when she said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve given you so many chances and you just threw it all away,‚Äù and then when I said ‚Äúokay, good luck,‚Äù she just replied ‚Äúpresh8.‚Äù That coldness and sarcasm hit me harder than anything else.

I feel anger, sadness, guilt, heartbreak ‚Äî all at the same time. I can‚Äôt stop replaying the moments we shared, the intimacy we had, the plans we made. It‚Äôs like my brain refuses to let me move on, and every time I try to think about anything else, these thoughts come rushing back. It makes me feel like my body is on fire inside, like I just want to explode or go psycho sometimes.
I feel like she‚Äôs the same person with him in some ways ‚Äî doing the things we would‚Äôve done together, maybe even writing letters, laughing, being intimate ‚Äî and that makes it worse. I keep thinking that the bond I shared with her might be happening again with him, and I can‚Äôt stop imagining it. I know it‚Äôs not my relationship anymore, and that it‚Äôll be different, but it still hurts the same because it‚Äôs her ‚Äî the same person I was so close with.

I‚Äôve tried blocking her and him, but I keep seeing reminders everywhere ‚Äî on social media, through mutual friends, even in random things like old notes or photos. My mind keeps bringing her back, and I feel like I‚Äôm completely alone with these thoughts. I don‚Äôt know anyone who‚Äôs been through something this specific ‚Äî cheating, breaking up, and then your ex almost immediately getting with a close friend.

I know I made mistakes and hurt her, and I feel guilty for cheating, but I also feel like what she and my friend did wasn‚Äôt loyal. I can‚Äôt stop thinking about the possibility of them being intimate, and it‚Äôs excruciating. Every day it feels like my mind is stuck on repeat, and it‚Äôs exhausting.

I just want to know if anyone out there has gone through something similar ‚Äî someone who cheated, broke up, and then had their ex move on almost immediately with a close friend. How did you cope with it? Did the thoughts ever stop?

1o66jst,"My avoidant ex is telling people ""we weren't working"" as the reason for our breakup.","Hi all.

My FA ex informed me that he already told our common friends that we have broken up (1 month after our breakup).

The reason that he told them was ""it's just wasn't working anymore, so we didn't force it"" and he told them ""I don't want to talk about it further"" and they respected him.

I felt so much injustice because that's not what happened. Our relationship was working up (at least that's what I thought) until he discarded me and there's a lot of compromises that we could've did but he outright refused.

I feel like the way he framed it is that we had issues and it just didn't work. But we weren't even fighting.

1o66iyw,Why Did He Do This to Me?,"He got close to me when he had other women in his life and kept denying it to me. Eventually I found out I was just one out of many. And I still gave grace thinking maybe he saw something special in me because he kept telling me I‚Äôm not like other women in his life and I shouldn‚Äôt compare myself to them. 

But then he kept crushing me by showing up for other women and doing the complete opposite to me and I don‚Äôt get why? 

I never did a single thing to hurt him in any shape or form. Neither him or the women in his life. I kept feeling him drifting away and changing with me since July. I kept begging for explanation and he gave me nothing. It‚Äôs always the same excuse ‚ÄúI‚Äôm busy‚Äù. 

And I still tried to make justifications. I thought maybe he just felt he made a mistake. Maybe he was really curious at first and then he just didn‚Äôt feel that attracted to me. 

What destroyed me emotionally wasn‚Äôt that he couldn‚Äôt love me back, but it‚Äôs the WAY he treated me in the end. Telling me he would help me with something and then bailing out. Making tons of excuses just to avoid seeing me even when it wasn‚Äôt personal and had something to do with work. He tells me he‚Äôll be there and when I show up he‚Äôs not and he tells me he left cuz he‚Äôs tired. He tells me to join an activity with another friend and then leaves me waiting for hours, not answering my calls or messages while I‚Äôm seeing him posting on Instagram online. 

I still kept begging for closure. Anything. He wouldn‚Äôt give me clarity. Why would a man behave like this? It feels like HATE. It felt like he‚Äôs punishing me for something and I couldn‚Äôt figure out what. 

One time he told me he was distancing himself because I did something to hurt his female friend whom he loves so much and ditched me for. I tried to confront and understand what is it that he thought I did but he gives me NOTHING. 

In the end he finally agreed to meet me for closure and then bailed out again, but agreed to speak to me on the phone. Those past two weeks I was dying inside from the things he said to me ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care if another guy gets close‚Äù, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm never marrying you‚Äù, ‚Äúthis is casual‚Äù when he told me countless times before it wasn‚Äôt when I asked. 

And during that call he struggled so hard to phrase things to me‚Äîto tell me he doesn‚Äôt feel anything for me. He said ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt continue with you loving me and me loving you‚Äù 

I felt my whole world was falling apart üíî I did everything I thought I could do to support and be by his side. I can‚Äôt think of anything that might spark resentment or hate to justify the way he treated me üíî 

I still tried to accept it. I said at first I want to do things his way and do casual but he still wouldn‚Äôt meet me halfway. 

Meanwhile during that time I kept seeing him with other women. Coaching one he‚Äôs extremely fond of as soon as she told him she needed his help. It took less than 24 hours for him to run to her rescue. The same thing I saw him do for another woman. And another. And another. 

That last week I sat there watching him flirt with another girl at his workshop while he was being extremely cold to me and asking me indirectly why I was there. 

I get that at times men don‚Äôt feel the same. I really do. I just don‚Äôt understand why a man would treat me this way? Like was I soooo horrible to the point where it couldn‚Äôt allow a man to give me the decency of telling me when things are over? 

He just decided he didn‚Äôt like me and then he didn‚Äôt feel it was necessary for me to know? Because I‚Äôm nothing worthwhile? My time. My feelings. My body. All of it. Was nothing to him? 

I‚Äôm on a trip after the breakup and I was feeling so strong about moving on. Then I saw one of his ****** yesterday posting about being out with him and it just broke me. 

How extremely easy it is for him to be with other women when he made excuses to avoid me like the plague. 

My issue right now is not that I didn‚Äôt get the man that I want. My problem is how I feel about MYSELF. 

How can I not feel like something is wrong with me???? Like I‚Äôm never good enough for a guy. I can‚Äôt stop feeling like if there was anything meaningful or amazing or special about me a guy wouldn‚Äôt do this to me üíî he wouldn‚Äôt avoid me like this.  He can‚Äôt even bring himself to say anything platonically to me. Nothing. While he‚Äôs completely fine doing it for others. 

It‚Äôs so difficult not to feel there‚Äôs something wrong with me. He kept telling me I‚Äôm better than her in every way. That I was his type. That he‚Äôs not into other women. I didn‚Äôt need to better than other women but why tell me that when he didn‚Äôt mean it? 

I know my worth but I no longer feel men see my worth. It‚Äôs breaking every drop of esteem that I have inside of me. 

I‚Äôm in horrible pain üíî I really am.

1o65y8w,I can't get over her after 2 years,"Hello guys please don't think im a bad person for this, but I have a girlfriend right now. Me and my ex girlfriend broke up 2 years ago because she thought I cheated on her. Months later she reached out to me saying she couldn't stop thinking about me so we had a weird situationship type thing going on. 

While we had this thing going on she started getting extremely distant and stopped texting me. I also realized she was following this boy again that I didn't like her talking to before. I asked her to please just block him but she said nothing was going on between them and he was a really good friend. I decided to start talking to another girl because she hadn't messaged me in about 2 weeks. I didn't tell my ex about this but I kind of just hoped she would kind of let us drift apart.

I started dating this new girl and then my ex found out and again started telling people I cheated on her. I know I was in the wrong but I dont believe it was cheating because im pretty sure she was seeing someone else behind my back. I kept dating this new girl (current girlfriend) and she's a much better match for me. 

After about 4 months I saw my ex and the guy I asked her not to talk to before WHERE DATING. I mean its not my place to tell them what to do but it still hurt me in some weird way. Now after a year passed I haven't thought about her in months but all of a sudden I just feel this gut wrenching feeling about her that I haven't felt before.

 I looked at her Instagram and she posted this guy everywhere and it hurt me even more because when me and her where actually dating she would be so stubborn about posting me and we had a lot of arguments about it.

And now for some reason I can't stop thinking about all the lies and terrible things she's done to me when I was dating her. I dont want to think about her anymore but why is she in my mind all of a sudden? Its causing just as much pain as the original breakup 2 years ago and I haven't talked to her in over a year.

1o65x0o,how to get over the feeling of being misunderstood,"going through a really bad breakup - I was starting to see some light though still miss my ex terribly. I feel like I lost not only my best friend but also my entire family from the last couple years. I have been trying to connect with whom I thought were my closest friends ever since and have been met with lofty statements of wanting to be friends and connect and be supportive and make plans, but nothing came to materialize. Recently found out one lied to me about plans not being set, found out through a social media post that I just wasn‚Äôt included. Some of these individuals knew my ex longer than me, some did not - but they had accepted me into their group and family even before my ex called me their partner. 

I reached out and expressed my disappointment in seeing the social media post, and was met with hostility and essentially being told my approach to grieving is wrong. I was just trying to stand up for myself, as this really hurt. I essentially found out these last few months when I‚Äôve been trying to maintain my connections and ask for support they have been spinning their own narratives about me (and likely to my ex). I just thought I knew my ex and these people better, and don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm the bad guy for trying to maintain autonomy from my ex in my friendships. I know I have a bold communication style and I did send receipts when incorrect accusations were being made, but it‚Äôs clear I wasn‚Äôt received well. 

My breakup was with an avoidant and was a discard - I didn‚Äôt expect the others to discard me, too. I guess their responses speak volumes. I‚Äôm trying to beat myself up for standing up for myself, albeit maybe not in the best way‚Ä¶ but really feeling like I went from a strong family and the best birthday celebration with them all to 6 weeks later being dropped and discarded in a very irrational manner. 

I have unpacked in therapy that I really hate feeling misunderstood, and think this just gave them more ammo in their false narratives. I feel powerless and support-less. It‚Äôs pretty soul crushing. How do you get over this feeling? I don‚Äôt even feel like I can continue living in the same city anymore‚Ä¶ but the thought of moving is overwhelming. I don‚Äôt know how to start over here, and I feel pretty powerless to try to fix their perception of me. 

I just don‚Äôt know how my ex could be okay with taking all this from me and making me feel like this. They told me they love me and were wanting us to grow together and a minute later said we need to break up (literally). Many of the others in the group always thanked me for being there for them, so I guess that‚Äôs why I imagined they‚Äôd be here for me. What are some ways to advocate for yourself and express pain and hurt without others taking it as guilting?

1o65wge,Boyfriend broke up with me out of nowhere,"I still feel like I‚Äôm in shock. 

Two nights ago he told me he can‚Äôt do it anymore and I thought he was joking. Hours before he broke up with me he was FaceTiming me while he was at work bc he said he just missed me that much. Then he came home and broke up with me. 

His reasoning was he feels like he‚Äôs a bum with no money and he doesn‚Äôt have his shit together. He‚Äôs had this feeling before and even told me I should break up with him bc of it and I told him I‚Äôm a grown woman and can decide for myself when to leave a relationship. I never had an issue with him having no money but I didn‚Äôt know the extent of his problems he‚Äôs been lying about paying rent on time his mom has to give him money every month for rent that still gets paid late. 

I told him I don‚Äôt care about any of that stuff and we can work through it but he‚Äôs insisting he can only get his shit together if we break up. He told me he can‚Äôt focus on himself & me at the same time that if I‚Äôm in his life he will use me as an excuse every time to not get his life in order. I begged him to try something different before we just break up bc we have no issues I asked him if he was happy in our relationship and he said yes he just wasn‚Äôt happy with himself. 

The emotional whiplash I‚Äôm feeling is unlike any other I feel like he just had a breakdown I know he‚Äôs been unhappy with his financial situation for some time but never thought he would make breaking up with me the solution. 

I told him if I had known it was this bad I would have been helping him save money and make smart financial decisions he told me he was embarrassed to tell me and it wouldn‚Äôt have changed anything bc he doesn‚Äôt want to be somebody who can‚Äôt spend money on their gf. 

I am just at a loss he won‚Äôt listen to reason he claims it‚Äôs not a mental health episode but he is acting in ways I‚Äôve never seen before he‚Äôs very calm in everything he‚Äôs doing and I feel like I‚Äôm losing my mind. I told him to take a week and think it over before finalizing any decision and he agreed. 

I feel like I‚Äôve been in a fog ever since I can‚Äôt believe he‚Äôd do something like that we‚Äôve been together a little over a year we talk about our future every day we talk through every issue that comes up and there really aren‚Äôt many. 

We live in the same complex his rent is 100$ cheaper than mine and we worked at the same job until very recently when I quit to go back to school and I‚Äôm paying all my bills fine. I truly don‚Äôt know where his money is going we don‚Äôt even go out much and when I do want to splurge and go somewhere I will gladly pay. 

I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôll do if he comes back in a week and tells me he‚Äôs fully done with us I can‚Äôt help but be insulted that he feels like he needs to make big changes in his life but so far the only thing he‚Äôs done is break up with me. 

Has anyone been through anything similar? He swears up and down it‚Äôs nothing to do with us & he just needs to get his life in order he has a history of mental health problems I‚Äôm worried this is the beginning of something bad.

1o65rn1,People hanging out and engaging with a horrible person,"Hi so for more context, I broke up with my ex of 5 years 6 months ago. I feel safe to say I am over him completely and do not wish them well as they were super abusive, manipulative and overall a horrible human being. My question is, will their friends ever figure out the horrible things my ex did to me? I find it crazy that people still associate themselves with someone like him who did me so dirty and made me completely lose myself. (I told my friends things I am not proud of that I did in the relationship because I know being able to hold myself accountable allowed me to grow from the experience) but what I have learned from my therapist is misery loves company. Does anyone relate to this?

1o65nym,"Imagine writing all this, and then going back?","Posted here a few weeks ago about my gf at the time, cheating and leaving me for her ex-fiance and moving in with him 2 weeks after we broke up. 

I found this online. Something she wrote when they initially broke up. Can you imagine writing this, feeling this way, and then going back while you have a BF? Mind you, they broke up cause he cheated on her with her best friend.

It is long so I apologize, but what an absolute loser to go back after 8 years when this is how you felt.

‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs over. Really over. She‚Äôs not talking to you, the pictures on her phone and social media have been deleted. She blocked your number, the accounts have been unfollowed and unfriended. The memories are still forever burned into your mind and maybe the past is the past, but the love will never go away. It was never supposed to happen, you weren‚Äôt supposed to end. But every day it gets a little easier. The crying sessions have shortened, the thoughts she has of you have been slowing, the love for you has been growing into resentment, the want for you back is growing weaker and the plans for a future with you have stopped and have begun to haunt her.
She‚Äôll go back and forth between loving you and hating you.
You broke all of your promises. It took a while for her to realize her worth but now, she has. She knows she deserves better than this, than you. You were what she dreamed of, everything she wanted, her world. But somewhere along the way, you began to drift. You went from her dream to her nightmare. You became everything you promised you never would. You broke her heart instead of continuing to try. You were a coward.
And at some point, you‚Äôll grow tired of fooling around. You‚Äôll remember her and the relationship and yearn for her. You‚Äôll contact her and beg her to come back to you.
But by then it will be too late.
She has put herself back together piece by piece. She has stopped thinking about it, about you. She stopped hoping and wishing. She‚Äôs no longer hurting. She was way stronger than you to begin with.
You let an amazing girl go, a good girl who loved you with all her heart. A girl who fought for you and didn‚Äôt want to give up.  
You‚Äôll see that she is happy without you. You‚Äôll see her photos pop up, you‚Äôll see her with another man, holding his hand, smiling and laughing with him, kissing him. And suddenly, you‚Äôll remember what it was like when she was with you. When you were the one that made her smile and laugh, when you were the one who kissed her, when you were the one she loved.
You‚Äôll miss her. You‚Äôll miss her laugh, you‚Äôll miss her smile, you‚Äôll miss her touch, her scent, her love, the way she made you feel. You‚Äôll miss having someone to talk to all the time, having someone who understands you. You‚Äôll miss having someone to call at 2:00 in the morning when you miss them or you can‚Äôt sleep.
And you will regret what you did, you‚Äôll regret ever hurting her.
She was the one thing in your life that actually made you feel like you had a purpose and you ruined it.
For what? So you could mess around with other girls who don‚Äôt care about you? She gave you everything, she would‚Äôve done anything for you, she was loyal as hell, she loved you more than she loved herself, you‚Äôll realize she was really down for you.
And now she‚Äôs moved on, she‚Äôs happy with someone else, and you‚Äôre alone. Even if you‚Äôre with someone else, you feel alone, because you know she was the one.
She was the one you were meant to be with. The one you love. And you threw it away because you were bored.
Your friends will tell you that you screwed up, your family will remind you all the time of how much they loved her and how you messed up. And you‚Äôll know it was your biggest mistake to let her go. It may take you a few months, maybe a few years, but when it hits you, it‚Äôs going to hurt like hell.
And you‚Äôll know exactly what you put her through. You‚Äôll finally understand what you did to her, and you will regret it forever, that‚Äôs a promise.

1o65n3a,Attending a party where my ex will be,"My ex and I broke up about three months ago, and we‚Äôve been in no contact for roughly two. The breakup happened mostly because of long distance she wasn‚Äôt sure she could handle that during senior year, especially since there‚Äôs a big chance we won‚Äôt end up at the same university.

There‚Äôs a party coming up  kind of an early graduation thing hosted by people from her current school. The twist is, I actually knew those people long before she did. She joined that school just three months ago, while I‚Äôve known the people throwing the party for over two years.

Our no-contact period after the breakup was rough. She had emotionally prepared for it since she‚Äôd been debating the breakup for months, but I hadn‚Äôt. I broke no contact several times ‚Äî through emails, group chats, and DMs trying to get another chance. After the third attempt, I broke down badly and begged her to get on a call so we could clear things up. We talked, and it went okay at first‚Ä¶ until it didn‚Äôt. She made it clear she doesn‚Äôt want to be friends that‚Äôs fair becaus she believes that i'd only be friends on the pretext of wanting to try again, whcihw as true my first three no-contact breaks. 

The issue now is our mutual friend group. We went to the same school for three years, and when we started dating, she basically merged into my group. Now, when our friends come visit, they often have to choose between hanging out with me or her. Lately, I‚Äôve seen them choose her more often, saying things like, *‚ÄúWe‚Äôre close with you already, but if we don‚Äôt see her, we might lose that friendship.‚Äù* I get where they‚Äôre coming from, but it still stings it feels like I‚Äôm losing people because of her, and it‚Äôs been making me feel pretty isolated.

At first, I just planned to go to the party to enjoy myself she shouldn‚Äôt be controlling my social life, especially with people I‚Äôve known longer. But lately, I‚Äôve been thinking about talking to her. Not to rekindle anything, I don‚Äôt want to get back together but to make things civil again. Something like:

>

If that goes well, I wouldn‚Äôt mind being friends eventually. She said the only way that could happen is if I moved on and while I haven‚Äôt yet, I‚Äôm not trying to get back with her either.

I‚Äôm 2 months post break up. I still think of him every day. I‚Äôm currently working 3 jobs to keep busy and ofc income. I‚Äôve been doing simple makeup again and doing things I normally don‚Äôt like to do. Whether it‚Äôs socializing with strangers with small convos or putting effort into events/holidays. I recently finally unfollowed him on social medias and it‚Äôs been really healing. I know I should‚Äôve done so from the start, but I yearned for glimpses of his life that I used to be a part of. His recent posts I realized I could no longer recognize him, like a truth bomb that he is in fact a stranger now and not my love. I still have it rough with the little time I have to sleep, I can‚Äôt, and think of him and the possibilities. Despite this, I‚Äôm also excited for what the future has in store for me. Saving up for vacays, tattoos, meeting up with more friends, or making new ones. Any new accomplishments even if they‚Äôre small. I do in fact text my notes app and also an old account of his that he no longer uses to counteract the possibility of breaking no contact again. I still hope that one day he reaches out first. Even if its not a ‚Äúget back together‚Äù thing, just knowing he thought of me enough to text. If he doesn‚Äôt thats okay too.

1o65fjn,todo para sentirse mejor,"hola a todos

saben no vine ac√° para que comprendan pero solo trato de desahogarme  han pasado dias de el sentimiento que me esta hiriendo cada noche y bueno sol quiero dejar de sobre pensar y dejar de sentirme mal por algo que yo no cause o tal vez si..

las cosas pasaron de una manera que capaz no lo esperaba  querer a alguien y luego sentirse insuficiente

sentirse un d√≠a todo y al siguiente que tu misma no te sientas todo

creer que un d√≠a todo mejorara  amar creer confiar tener la esperanza en la persona que piensas que te defender√° y al d√≠a siguiente enterarte que esa persona ni le importas deja que sobrepasen de ti y que se burlen de manera cruel ‚Ä¶

amar con todo lo que uno espera recibir esta tan perdido  tener en cuenta que sus palabras son mentiras y que todo lo que un d√≠a cre√≠ste que puede mejorar puede ser que todo se desmorono

no culpo a nadie capaz soy yo misma haci√©ndome tantas ideas en la cabeza y intentando que nadie sea el responsable de mi ansiedad o mi resentimiento

pero  creer que el cari√±o y el apoyo que di solo fue recibido para luego decir barbaridades de mi

que no limito a su familia a hablar sobre mi persona y que no entienda mi dolor

yo no quiero que el se pelee con su familia por mi pero solo quiero que espero que cambie y que reflexione sobre todo que entienda que uno da todo y capaz con tantos problemas yo tambi√©n me volv√≠ distante y sent√≠ rechazo hacia el  cuando intentaba darme un abrazo o beso

pero recordar el dolor y recordar todo lo que pase..

quisiera que comprenda que yo  mi cari√±o sigue intacto pero entender que el no respeta mi opini√≥n y ahora le da igual lo que sienta  pero yo  lo escuche respete su decisi√≥n y lo ayude cuando nadie lo apoyo

estuve en sus malos momentos aunque el en los m√≠os no se preocupo

el sabe que tenemos un angelito en el cielo  por su irresponsabilidad lo perdimos

pero no lo culpo no hubiera querido que mi bebe sufriera en esta vida

que no culpo a nadie por lo que ha pasado que siempre tendr√© en cuenta que el no logro cambiar capaz no era la indicada para el por cada momento que me quise alejar que llore hasta dormir y que se me haga un nudo en la garganta

yo lo quiero aun que no parezca a pesar de las dificultades y todo lo que mi familia dec√≠a yo lo ame mucho porque cuando pasaron tantas cosas yo segu√≠a ah√≠ pensando en todo para que no me afectara abec√©s sus actitudes pero no me sentir√© obligada a estar al lado de alguien que permite que su familia hable a sus espaldas y que frente a mi me traten mejor la hipocres√≠a no esta de primer lugar en ni panorama

pregunte a mis amigas y dicen que que deber√≠a enfocarme en el y en mi que no debe contar su familia  pero el sentimiento de sentirme idiota y traicionada que la persona que quise no hiso nada por  al menos no dejar que se burlen aun me duele y

sentirme como basura a pesar de que doy m esfuerzo cada d√≠a para salir y  sentirme linda al mirarme al espejo sentirme segura de que no pasara  lo mismo en un futuro trabajar en mi autoestima o  cuidar lo que una persona da√±o sin  motivo que nunca pudo apoyarme y que pensaba que yo exageraba en todo que al final de todo las promesas quedaron atr√°s y que me quede sola con el vientre vac√≠o y decepcionada de el que pase sola el proceso de que te quiten una vida y espero no me juzguen pero este mundo era muy toxico para dar otra vida y mas en las condiciones que su papa solo pensaba en otras cosas

me sent√≠ abrumada sin ganas de nada llore por mi hijo o hija tantos d√≠as que me quede seca sin √°nimos sin terapia sin consejos sin ayuda sin tener a alguien a quien pueda contar nada

salir de ese d√≠a sola con dolor y sangrando  es feo

pero ya quedara en mi todo eso cuanto sufr√≠ y cuando ame a ese hijo que no naci√≥ y que ahora espero que en otra oportunidad pueda volver a mi ..

las cosas pasan por algo dicen pero yo solo quer√≠a que me aceptaran por lo que era no por lo que pod√≠a soportar o aguantar

siento que perd√≠ mi esencia

que perd√≠ mis ganas de ser yo misma por el miedo Aser juzgada

cada noche sentirse insuficiente...

ya no me nace dar cartas regalos o lo que mas me gustaba hacer postres

destruyeron todo mi  expresi√≥n

destruyeron todo lo que cre√≠a que era amor

pero capaz yo tambi√©n lo da√±e no se como pero capaz las cosas fue culpa mutua ..

yo decid√≠ alejarme para que el fuera feliz llore esa noche sigo llorando en momentos donde su esencia no esta para hacerme re√≠r o para hacerme entender que el me sigue extra√±ando pero bueno gracias por escucharme  y si llegaste hasta ac√° espero les valla muy bien y les deseo lo mejor ..",MediocreTangerine254,1760414257.0,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o65fjn/todo_para_sentirse_mejor/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o65fjn/todo_para_sentirse_mejor/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o65dgo,Need Advice: Reconnecting with an ex after 6 months of no contact (22F) (22M),"
Hey everyone! I could really use some advice or suggestions. Life is full of surprises and confusion.

This guy and I broke up in March 2025. The reason why we broke up was because my other ex (that I dated back in 2023) one day found out about the guy new. So my other ex decided to get revenge and kissed me in front of the new guy on campus. Also my older ex always had a fantasy to mess up with anyone‚Äôs relationship which is toxic. So he was messing up everything else‚Äôs too. So the new guy blocked me on all socials. After a month, we both agreed to exchange stuff. We met on campus and he gave me back my tote bag. We talked for a bit and he initiated a hug. This was on 04/09/2025.

After that, he graduated, and after months and months we have been in zero contact since.

Once I moved up to DC, I unpacked everything. As I was unpacking, I found a drawing on my tote bag (the same tote back my ex gave back to me). It had a few doodles and it even had a date ‚Äú04/09/2025‚Äù on it. I knew immediately it was from him and I felt very emotional. I kept it with me everywhere I went.

Suddenly, my ex‚Äôs dad popped up on Facebook. It was like a suggestion to follow. I did check out his profile and pictures just to see if there is a certain picture of my ex. I eventually found one and accidentally clicked ‚Äúlike‚Äù. I immediately unliked and blocked his dad of embarrassment. It was humiliating‚Ä¶

Then very recently like the next day, I decided to see if my ex still has me block, and turns out he decided to unblock me from there and all other socials. I was a bit spooked. This marks the date of 09/08/2025.

Then after a month 10/08/025, I redownload Hinge (the same app we found each other in the beginning), and then first guy that pops up is HIM! I was very spooked then. Like what was the universe trying to tell me?! It even said ‚Äúhe‚Äôs new here‚Äù. In his looking section it says ‚Äúlife partner: I‚Äôve got all the time in the world, do you?‚Äù

I decided to hit him a heart and add ‚Äúhey ____ I hope you‚Äôre good. I know you don‚Äôt wanna talk but I found the drawing you left in my tote bag and I really like it. I really miss you!!‚Äù

IMMEDIATELY he responds back with a match. He tells me about his job, and that he would love to talk again if I was up for it and he misses me too. I told him yes I‚Äôd love to call him.

Then he calls me. We talk for HOURS! We catch up on everything, work, our lives, etc. He works 50 hours per week and earns $24 per hour. He is very hard working and that‚Äôs one of the many things I like about him. He kept telling me I was very pretty and so wonderful. He was surprised to see me on a dating app again too. He has his own house and lives by himself. He told me he misses me and wants to see me again. He also said that after awhile he realized what my other ex did to me wasn‚Äôt my fault at all. He tried to make plans during our call. Then it was getting close to his bedtime (he goes to bed at 9 pm to wake up early around 5 am). So we decided to plan later.

It was so wonderful to hear from him. After all this time. I missed his voice so much.

On Sunday (10/12/2025), he disappeared on Hinge. I‚Äôm not too sure what it means. I want to assume he deleted his account after him and I reconnecting again. This timing seems to support that logic but can‚Äôt be certain.

Today I texted him, ‚ÄúHey ____! I found out that on the Metro the last stop on the orange line is the closest towards you. It‚Äôs called the New Carrollton Station (which is like about 1 HR 31 min drive from ____). Maybe we can find an event for us to do or something during a weekend around your area or close. I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs there in your area haha. Also, I‚Äôd like to talk more about planning this weekend on a phone call. Lmk when you‚Äôre available. If not, no worries at all :)‚Äù

So far no response. I know he‚Äôs busy with work and has a tight schedule. He even told me he‚Äôs pretty tied to his job. But he sorta active on Instagram but not always. I now follow him back on Insta but so far he hasn‚Äôt followed back.

What are ways to feel better about the situation and is anyone else experiencing something similar? I‚Äôm probably overthinking everything and he might just be very busy. It‚Äôs just hard because we both really like each other but I guess I have to learn to be patient.",sparkle_sapphire2125,1760414074.0,2,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o65dgo/need_advice_reconnecting_with_an_ex_after_6/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o65dgo/need_advice_reconnecting_with_an_ex_after_6/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o658h4,What‚Äôs a normal amount of time for an ex to respond after breaking 10 months of NC?,"I texted my ex 3 days ago after 10 months of no contact, and she hasn‚Äôt responded.

I am almost certainly expecting no response, but I just wanna cling on to at least a little bit of hope over the next few days.

For context, she broke up with me, I begged, got blocked, and had to text her using a TextNow number. I am 100% aware that this is not ideal and that I PROBABLY should not have texted her again, but hear me out. I truly believe that me and her could work IF we tried again and if we both grew over the 10 months, which I believe I did. And I knew that if I never broke no contact, we‚Äôd likely never speak again, so I decided to say fuck it.

1o657et,Is my ex(26F) stringing me(24M) along?,"Some backstory, 6 months ago me and my girlfriend mutually broke up due to timing, I‚Äôm still living at home saving up and paying off student loans while she had so much going on with her health, her family, and working long hours at work. We wanted the same things such as marriage, family, etc but she wanted sooner than I did as we only were together a little over a year and a half.

So after we broke up we didn‚Äôt talk for a little bit, but since we‚Äôve constantly been in contact. We‚Äôve talked for hours, we‚Äôve hung out, we‚Äôve gone to dinners, we‚Äôve gone to the movies. We always have a great together. I‚Äôve even bought her little gifts and stuff. But it‚Äôs hot and cold, sometimes it feels like she wants nothing to do with me, other time she wants me to talk or hang out. But i‚Äôm doing a lot of the initiating.

A month in a half ago I told her in person how I felt, how I still loved her, how I wanted us to work, what I had learned and what would be different, and just my goals for us. She expressed her love and care for me, and how she wanted me in her life, but said she didn‚Äôt know what she wanted right now and she was figuring herself out still. She told me she‚Äôs not dating or looking to right now and that she‚Äôd let me know when she is.

I just feel stuck in a way, like it feels like she‚Äôs leaving this door cracked open keeping my hope up but not committing to me. She‚Äôs even called me the ideal man for her and husband material, but she doesn‚Äôt seem afraid of losing me either. I know I can‚Äôt wait for her, i mean it could be months and years, and i mean it‚Äôs already been 6 months.

1o654c8,Got back together with my girlfriend after full 2 months apart but now she‚Äôs distant and unaffectionate..,"My girlfriend and I got back together about 10 days ago after being broken up for 2 months. We were together for 11 months before that. Since getting back together, we‚Äôve been living together again for these past 10 days.

Since reconciling, things feel very different. We‚Äôve only had sex once, and that one time it was me who initiated it. It felt rushed, like she just wanted to get it over with. There was barely any kissing or foreplay, and it didn‚Äôt feel intimate at all.

Another thing I‚Äôve noticed is she‚Äôs not being affectionate anymore. When we go to bed, she turns her back and goes straight to sleep. No cuddling, no hugs, not even in the morning before she leaves for work. I still try to show affection, hug her, kiss her, and make small gestures to connect, but it feels one-sided. Her low effort is honestly starting to make me pull back too, because it‚Äôs uncomfortable trying when I don‚Äôt feel anything back.

I also want to make it clear that I never show impatience, frustration, or anger when she doesn‚Äôt seem interested in intimacy. I always try to be understanding and respectful, as I know pressuring someone is the worst thing you can do. But the lack of affection and closeness is really starting to weigh on me emotionally.

Before we broke up, she was much more caring and affectionate. Even then, she didn‚Äôt initiate sex as often as I was used to in past relationships, but I didn‚Äôt mind because I know everyone‚Äôs different. But this time around, it feels completely different. I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that I‚Äôm unloved and unwanted, and it‚Äôs making me not even want to initiate intimacy anymore.

For context, I‚Äôm in my early 40s, and I‚Äôve had my fair share of relationships. This is the first time I‚Äôve ever been in a situation like this. In the past, my partners were often the ones initiating intimacy, sometimes multiple times a day. So this situation is new territory for me.

Has anyone been through something similar after getting back together with a partner? If so, how did you approach it?

I just broke up with my girlfriend of 4 years and it just hurts. I thought she was going to be the one. She cheated on me with a coworker a few months ago. It was more like she started and entirely different relationship with her coworker and then lied to us both about it and when I found out we tried to work through it but she kept both relationships going up until about 2 weeks ago when I found and and still wanted to try to work through it. But we just broke up today and I can't help but feel like everything is just so hollow. She was always one of the only people in my life that I could just talk to and now that she's gone I have to deal with it all by myself. She told me that I drained the soul and happiness from her life in her final text to me. Honestly her final text to me felt like she was just trying to hurt me in every conceivable way possible. I just don't know what to do anymore.

I'm sorry if that didn't make any sense, I just needed somewhere to talk about it all

1o64x9r,I need some advice please,"This is going to be a bit of a ramble, so apologies for the long read, but any advice / experience / feedback will be greatly appreciated thanks

Its been 2 months since my ex girlfriend broke up with me (we were together for 2 years). We ended on really good terms. She initially wanted a ""break"" but i suggested we may aswell ""break up"". We told each other we still love each other, we both agreed we have our own issues we must resolve alone, and that 6 months or a year from now we can rekindle our relationship. The reason she ended things was because she felt confused about ""us"", and that she was emotionally scarred from the start of our relationship (I was a horrible boyfriend at the start, we were great alone but in a group setting I would barely talk to her, rarely show any physical or verbal affection when with other people). But we got through that little bump and everything was going swell. And she also had a hard upbringing with her parents and they didn't show love often, so she also struggles with that. 

She turned 18 two months before we broke up, and ever since then our relationship went downhill. She was really scared about not making any uni frieinds (this is our first year at uni) but she found a group of girls that shared common interests and really liked her. But the issue was they would go clubbing like 1-3 times a week. Usually until very late like 3am. I never brought up the issue because I didn't want to seem like I was insecure or jealous, and she really wanted some good friends which she found so I didn't want to interrupt that. But then she would forget to say goodnight when she was out, wouldnt snap or text me, started to cancel plans with me to go out with her friends , and she wouldn't tell me that thats the reason she was cancelling. So I started to become quite sad, and when we would hangout I wasn't being myself. So everything just started to fall apart, she thought i was becoming distant and I struggled to act lovingly around her because i thought she was going to end things. 

So yeah just a little bit of context there. So we both agreed that our relationship was fading, I was acting weird and she just wanted to go out and experience the world, she said she wanted me to come out of my shell and it would be best to do that without her by my side. Which I fully understand because now that shes gone i've realised I don't have much going on in my life. So I fully understand her reasons to part, like I wasn't the best boyfriend, didnt show much love. 

But the connection her and I have is like we are soul mates, we just clicked the first day we met. She was my first everything so I love her so much. And I really want us to get back together, but I also know girls often say ""we can get back together later' to help soften the pain but they don't mean it. So idk what to believe anymore.

And one last thing is she wanted to stay in contact after the breakup, but I suggested if we really want this to workout and fix ourselves best go in no contact. She was sad and surprised to hear that. 1 month in she replied to my Instagram story saying good song choice (it was a song we both liked), but she sent this while out and at like 1 am so she was probably drunk at the time. Im hoping this action means she still loves me and thinks about me, meaning we will get back together in the future, idk.

One final thing, we do have a mutual group (not including her uni friends) from highschool and there is a halloween party coming up in 2 weeks. She and I are both going, so how should I act? should i be friendly and act like friends or try not to speak with her?

Sorry for the ramble, if anyone has experience in something like this I'd like to know how it went, what happened, and if I should start moving on and prepare for her not to comeback. Thanks

1o64s47,I am really confused,"My ex gf broke up with me a couple of weeks ago. 10 days after she broke up she was in our flat to take some stuff to her parents. We talked and she was really torn. She cried a lot and told me a couple of times that its really hard for her. I hugged her and she hugged me back. 
After that she wrote a message as soon as she was at her parents, that basicly said that she doesnt want to have any contact until 2 months have passed. She also wrote that she would be willing to try again if she would see that i have changed.  Only organisational and never in Person. I respected that. 

Fast forward two weeks, today she came by to get some clothes. We agreed to not speak in Person. She wanted that explicitly.  I said that i will stay in my room. 

She still knocked, and as soon i opened the door she started to cry.  
We talked and she said she needs to stay away from to get over our relationship.  She also said to me that she has feelings for me, but feelings are not enough to save a relationship.  Excuse me feelings are not enough?

Then she said that the Thing she said with maybe getting together wont Happen for sure. And that we could start again in one year. 
I was really devestated as i hoped she would still think about a future together. She went home and i started to think about everything she said.

Then again she wrote me. I dont get why write if you Tell me that u dont want to have contact.  She basicly started to excuse herself for hurting me and for the false promises.

1o64feh,Caught a restraining order and hitting rock bottom,"I apologize for the long vent but to any of you who take the time to read this, I really appreciate you. It‚Äôs been a month since she left. Haven‚Äôt heard a word from her since a few hours after she stormed out. She told me to never contact her again or she would call the police. But that didn‚Äôt stop me. I‚Äôll get to that later. For some background on the relationship, I‚Äôm a male and we‚Äôre both 22 years old. I met her last year and got attached very fast. She was in the midst of a breakup herself at the time and wasn‚Äôt exactly replicating the same feelings towards me during the first couple months. But we continued to see each other frequently and grew to be very codependent (at least I did). We had a very good sex life and she told me countless times that no one has ever made her feel as good as I did. Things started off pretty good between us, however, after a few months, my insecurities started pouring out and I began accusing her of cheating all the time. I wanted to know where she was at all times and I couldn‚Äôt trust her to be faithful to me. At one point, I caught her texting another guy she met on that very same day. She refused to show me the text messages between them and started crying until I finally convinced her to let me see. They were pretty flirtatious and she was clearly trying to make plans. I chose to stay with her because I didn‚Äôt have anybody else. This event changed my whole view on her and I started to feel like my insecurities were completely valid. Everyday we would get into long arguments and I was constantly seeking validation from her. This is when it started to become an on and off thing. We would split for a few days or a week and then act like nothing happened. Few months ago she got drunk at a bar and slept with a man twice her age. She called me at 4 in the morning telling me she thinks that she just got raped. I went to pick her up from the hotel and I knew it was bullshit but I knew I didn‚Äôt have the courage to leave her. In these recent months, she hadn‚Äôt been allowed at my parents house so we were getting hotels each week to have sex and cuddle. I would buy her a lot of stuff too. We weren‚Äôt dating at this point but we made the agreement to be ‚Äú exclusive‚Äù which I think was just code for her wanting to meet other guys. She started making new friends who were all guys and every time I would accuse her and tell her it‚Äôs weird to be hanging out with them one on one she would just tell me to stop being insecure. During our last moments together, she was showing me a meme on her phone when a guys name I was unfamiliar with popped up. I confronted her about it immediately and she kept telling me none of your business. I wouldn‚Äôt stop pushing until she finally had enough and stormed out. I haven‚Äôt seen her since but I‚Äôve been trying to contact her every night by making fake Instagram and TikTok accounts. Each time I was blocked without a response. Today, a police officer showed up and gave me papers for a restraining order against me. I‚Äôm just gonna be brutally honest and accept the RO and maybe it can give me a wake up call. I know it was wrong to harass her like that. But I still had hope in us and don‚Äôt see myself getting with anybody else who‚Äôs nearly as pretty as her. Now that I know for sure we will never speak again, I feel like I‚Äôve hit rock bottom. I feel too depressed to do anything, and want to die. I know what I could do which is focus on my healing and grow as a person, but I feel so stuck rn.

1o64c57,Ditched me then called the police,"Hey it's been about two months since I've seen my ex fiance I am 26m she is 26f I'm doing a lot better now but I thought I'd share my story as hopefully someone can give me insight as to why this has happened so my ex and I were together 8.5 years met working at a fast food place been through good and bad times naturally as we were teenagers when we first met we made a lot of mistakes but while I was forgiving she seemed to hold on to my mistakes. 

So to get into the story we were living with each other for about 6 years because her parents kicked her out for being way too messy (this is important later) so at the time I was living with my brother and his wife at the time I took her in no question then eventually we got an apartment with each other as nobody from my family liked her. We lived there for nearly 4 years then more recently we moved out to another apartment where the story takes place I currently still live in this apartment where we have lived for approximately 1.2 years.

From my point of view we always had a good relationship there were rough patches but we always got through them we were always laughing and trying to spend time with each other and we had very similar goals the only real downside was money she got into massive debt from covid and always blamed it on me she got really into drinking to where it was a daily occurrence and smoking weed at pretty much the same rate it was rare for her to be sober for even a day witch didn't help with money at all I however did try to help her with money but I was in the beginning stages of my career and didn't have a lot to help with as I also had a car payment and a little credit card debt as well so we made a deal I pay a little less for the monthly expenses at first then I take over the entire household for the most part once my debt was paid off a month before that was going to happen one day she says that she's going to a group rehab spot and she will be moving out and in the middle of the night took a lot of her stuff we still texted and she still called me her spouse but she was talking to me so formally I assumed getting off the substances made her feel off but deep down I knew something was wrong. While in the program we hung out a total of 2 times and both times we said we missed each other and kissed (for a long time) and even said I love you then some very bad things happened apparently (idk what's a lie and what isn't) her friend she made in the program killed herself and she found the body and her parents got really sick so she asked for space because everything was overwhelming her. I gave her the space then asked if she was still going to come hang out with me on the day we planned the week previous she said yes then the day before we were suppose to hang out she blocked me on everything and ransacked the apartment taking things that belonged to me and her naturally I freaked out and tried calling her a bunch of times on different numbers she picked up the phone and sounded so cold and said I was abusive and I gaslit her (once I said I fed out pets when I didn't) and I didn't deserve even a goodbye and she told me that she only stayed with me for the pets and that she never loved me. Being even more confused and emotional I called and texted her some more she picked up a couple times pretty much just saying she doesn't want to be with me and that she had been talking to a guy from her work for the past 2 months (before she moved out) and I got arrested by the police for harassment I'm doing really well financially now so paying my 4500 lawyer bill isn't the end of the world but I'm just so confused as to how or why she could do this to me I have stopped crying about it and such but I'm still worried for her as she has a history of mental illness I legally can't contact her or even be 200m from her she faked texts from me threatening her witch is the main reason why I was arrested I'm sorry if this is poorly written but God dam I'm just so confused as to what happened ",warhanner,1760410991.0,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o64c57/ditched_me_then_called_the_police/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o64c57/ditched_me_then_called_the_police/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o64b16,She was the only hope i had in life,"My mother died when i was 15. Since then my life was a constant suffering from phisical and mental abuse from the rest of my familly, then orphanege untill i was 17. I met her when i was 18. And i thought she's the one. I've started to fix my life for her. Since i've had nothing i managed. Went to bigger city, got a stable job, went to collage at the same time. I got used to beeing on foot for more then 24 hours. You know, night shift-collage-another night shift. All of this for her, for our life that i was dreaming of. But this had a price.

We moved together for collage since we're the same age. And from that point on it all went downhills. She's from a upper middle-class family so she got her money from her parents. I didn't mind at first that i have to work while she doesn't. But early on i found out that this isn't a partner relationship. I bearly was at home, but i did all the chores while she made the mess. I was coocking. I was paying for 90% of ""common"" expenditure. And what she was doing? Sleeping most of the time, getting high on benzo and xanax, or playing Roblox with her friend xD. But it was me that was the issue. That i'm not present, that i'm usually stressed, anxious or angry. That i'm not buying her enough gifts. And i was aware what it looks like. But i loved her, and life with her was my only goal anyways. I'm not sure at wich point i've developed depression. But that was it, and it was getting worse with every day.

Intimacy died first. Then the conversations. Then she probably started to resent me, but she would not leave her additional wallet. And i was still there, i still loved her, despite all of this shit. It went on for 3 years. And finnaly she left. She told one of my female friends that ""she was waiting for me to cheat so she would have an exuse for leaving me"". That was her real view of me. When she relised it isn't going to happen she cheated herself and left.

And now i have depression, no life-work balance, no passions, no goals. I'm now living a life on expert mode for nothing, because all of this was for her. I know i could move on once again. But i'm finally broken. I don't care about anything. I got stuck in this meaningless life and don't have any strenght left.

1o64216,How do people just switch up on you overnight and in the nastiest way possible?,"6 months. I gave him everything. Time, money, energy. Received nothing. Quite literally not a single penny spent on me. No dates planned. Just 2-3 small bouquets and a necklace from the mall. Initially, he gave me all emotional energy (the only thing he could give) and went above and beyond when I was going through depressive states.

But it was so inconsistent. Love one day. Coldness the next. Said I could communicate whatever so he could change himself, be honest and have great communication and we can make this work he said. When I did he got defensive as fuck and said the most hurtful things. How bad he's trying to not shut down because of life yet I don't see him trying. He used to get mad about me being mad at his mistakes.

Always chose his friends over me. Moved further away from me to relocate to be closer to them. Went for sleepovers to other girl's homes, they came over to his too for the same. He only ever had female friends and a female BESTIE who he was obsessed with and got very defensive about her. He'd say he's working on assignments and is too busy to meet me or do anything but would have other people over and play video games with them. When I asked why he was doing that he got mad. He disappeared on me for 3-4 days saying he's burnt out but was talking to others. When I sent him flowers, he thought I was manipulating him to show up.

I have spent over a lac on him in 6 months. Paying for all concerts, food, dates, his cab rides back home when he came to see me because I felt that's the least I could do if he's coming to see me for a little over an hour and going back home 2 hrs away, thrice a week (a system he came up with since he was moving far away and I work full time multiple jobs I can't travel so much).

He lovebombed me a day before the breakup. Then the next day called me disgusting, a pathological liar because I didn't prove things to him whether I knew a well known artist and other small stuff, said he was warned against me, called me abusive, invading his space, boundaries, manipulative, etc etc. Basically character assassinated me to the point it's broken my sense of self-trust and then blocked me everywhere. Not even telling me who these warnings were from or what they were. He took all his things by saying he needed stuff like his game controller for an assignment. Said nothing was enough for me I always had issues and how I consumed him.

For me he was my first everything so the detachment has taken some work. I'm mostly healed at this point BUT we still follow each other on social media. For me its because that's really the last thread I have of the relationship  and its scary to cut it off completely. 

I have been no contact with him officially a year because talking to him was painful. He was cold and dismissive afterwards and eventually he said some things that hurt too much that caused me to just stop trying to fix things.

He's not a social media person much BUT he has taken to using IG notes to in my opinion ""send smoke signals"". Now I know us women get a reputation of reading too hard into things but I feel after knowing someone for almost a decade, I can tell when a song is a song or when he's posting something in hopes of inciting a reaction. 

Today he posted a song and a caption that is way too ""obvious"" that my theory about him sending indirect messages is correct. 

He posted a song I introduced him to by my favorite band. He posted ""Just another girl"" by The Killers but then he added the caption underneath "" a hoe gone be a hoe"" üíØ

Again I know 1. I shouldn't care and 2.it could mean anything.

But he does this quite frequently.  I don't have a good reasoning to still follow him so let's ignore that part because none of my attachment  to him at this point after all the healing I've done makes any point but....I'm curious to know a man's perspective on this. Is this an indirect jab at me?

Mind you he left ME not the other way around and I still tried to fix things after. Its been a year already and I'm still traumatized to even be in a relationship after what I went though with him so I don't understand the contrast between the song and caption.",Welcome-Background,1760408887.0,1,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o63m5h/this_may_be_a_stretch_but_im_curious/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o63m5h/this_may_be_a_stretch_but_im_curious/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o63gqo,I made the biggest mistake snd hurt my partner,"I idk why I‚Äôm here and why I‚Äôm doing this. I know it‚Äôs all my fault. My decisions led me to this point in our beautiful relationship, and I ruined it. I‚Äôm aware of it. I don‚Äôt want to blame anyone but me.

I‚Äôm an 18-year-old boy who once hated the idea of cheating in a relationship. I said to myself I wouldn‚Äôt do it, so you probably know by now what‚Äôs the problem.

I had a crush on this girl when I first saw her in high school. We were both juniors, and we were 1 year apart. I just saw a glimpse of her doing their academic performance at the school gym. I thought of her as a cute, intelligent woman. Then that was it I never saw her again and forgot about her.

After that, I started a relationship with a girl who was introduced by my classmate because they were distant cousins, and she had a crush on me. She and my current girlfriend right now were the same year as her. We chatted for a day, and I jokingly said, ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôll court you right now, will you be my girlfriend?‚Äù and she suddenly accepted and didn't know each other much before becoming a bf and gf.

So yes, 2 days of introduction to her and 1 day of chatting we were boyfriend and girlfriend. I didn‚Äôt know how to be a good boyfriend at that time, because of the pandemic I was all hauled up in my house not interacting with new faces and had a problem socially interacting with people with my age I was just gaming all day reading manga and anime and I just did my best to make that girl laugh. I didn‚Äôt really do any major things as her boyfriend. I was too innocent and simply followed my own idea of what a good boyfriend was.

Then months went by we broke up. I was a senior at that time and made many mistakes. It was my fault. The problem was communication. I didn‚Äôt say to her what was bothering me, that I wanted change. Well, I said it but didn‚Äôt stand on it firmly.

Then we broke up, said many unclear things, and I didn‚Äôt think much of it. I was just moving on with my life. I would say I was happy we broke up and that I was single. I wanted to focus on myself and realized there were many mistakes I made that I could‚Äôve improved in that relationship. But still, I moved on.

By the time I was having my senior first year it was the third month I started having a crush on my cousin‚Äôs classmate. She was cute, intelligent, and we had the same interests. I stalked her account a healthy amount and I remembered she was the same girl I caught a glimpse in the gym, and after weeks of having a crush on her, I discovered she had mutual feelings with her classmate.

That hurt me for a day, but I said, ‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs how it is,‚Äù because the guy she liked was a friend of mine. They were a perfect fit. By the end of my first senior year, I moved on and accepted it. I was still improving as a person.

I‚Äôm a man... or boy haha. I‚Äôm pathetic. I truly regret my decisions right now. I‚Äôm someone who needs to make mistakes to realize things and improve from them. But enough of that  let‚Äôs continue.

Class ended, and weeks before classes started again, the girl I liked in my early senior year confessed that she had a crush on me. She confessed that night, and I was truly happy and flabbergasted. It was a whole new feeling for me. I truly never felt that before. I even asked if it was a prank set by my cousin because she knew I liked her before.

We chatted that whole night, sticking close to a power outlet to charge my phone  I didn‚Äôt have the best phone at that time, so the battery ran out quickly. We ended the conversation that night saying many things like, ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt we meet sooner?‚Äù But I knew if we met sooner, we would‚Äôve broken up, because in my past two quick relationships, I didn‚Äôt know how to be a proper boyfriend.

This time, I promised myself I‚Äôd do better.

Weeks went by, we chatted, and I discovered her mom worked abroad. This is too long  blah blah months went by. Eleven months I courted her because her mom said I should wait for her to be 18 before she‚Äôd accept me as her boyfriend. I respected that because I kept saying that this is the one I‚Äôd do anything for.

And yes, I did. I reviewed my past mistakes as a partner and reflected on them. She was truly my first love. I‚Äôd never felt like this before. Every move I made, I kept overthinking  afraid I‚Äôd mess up and ruin it.

So, eleven months went by. In the tenth month, I started thinking, ‚ÄúCan we really make this work? LDR is hard. I‚Äôm going to college without her. I can‚Äôt live without seeing her.‚Äù I was emotionally obsessed with her. Not in a crazy way, just... I thought of her every day. I loved her, really.

So yes, I was having negative thoughts about having an LDR. Hearing things about LDR made me doubt. Then, by the 11th month, she suddenly accepted me she wasn‚Äôt 18 yet. I didn‚Äôt really know how to feel. I felt guilty because I had all these negative thoughts. It even came to my mind that we should break up because it hurt me to think she‚Äôd go on vacation to see me, and then leave again and not think about her that im hurting her and not consider her feelings that she's hurting too.

I truly loved her. I didn‚Äôt want to be a burden, because her mom planned to take her to another country for college.

Ahh, fuck. I really am dumb  a fool. She was sure about me, but I thought negative things and didn‚Äôt trust her fully. She trusted me 100%.

4-5 weeks before her birthday, the negative thoughts won. I grew cold with her. One night, my ex chatted with my cousin. They became friends because I introduced them online (my cousin lives far away). My ex sent a picture to my cousin about missing the spot where me and my ex hung out once.

Then I fucked up. I entertained the idea that there were many unsaid things between me and my ex and wanted to apologize  completely forgetting about my girlfriend.

I was at my lowest, honestly. From all the negative thoughts about LDR and my relationship, I wondered if we‚Äôd even work out. I mean, she wasn‚Äôt the perfect girlfriend  I was her first real relationship, so she had her pros and cons but I tried my best for our relationship to work and it did but the thought of ldr hindered me our rs was going smoothly but I was still unsure for ldr.

So that led me to that moment. I entertained chatting with my ex to ‚Äúreconcile.‚Äù I know wtf dude.

I initially just planned to say sorry for what I‚Äôd done and move on. We both had partners. But the chat deepened that night, from ‚Äúsorry‚Äù to ‚Äúhow are you,‚Äù and I grew cold toward my girlfriend.

Then my girlfriend decided to dump me because I was getting cold. I froze up that night. I was attending a friend‚Äôs debut, and I sat in the corner reading her breakup message, crying my eyes out. I realized so many things  holy shit, what am I doing? But it was too late.

I entertained another girl while having a girlfriend. I cried the whole night  it was the first time I cried for a girl. I realized how much I truly loved her.

After that, I agreed to the breakup because I thought I couldn‚Äôt handle LDR and because of my mistake (which she didn‚Äôt know yet).

Then I made it worse. I still chatted with my ex for 5 days or a week after the breakup, coping with the loss of the girl I planned my future with. But by the end of that, I resolved to cut my ex off. I ghosted her completely.

I decided that, but it was too late. I‚Äôd already cheated. It happened before the breakup a day or 2. I entertained another girl while in a relationship the biggest mistake of my life.

But knowing me, I completely buried that fact, moved on, and tried to reconcile with my girlfriend.

By her birthday, I wanted her to invite me, but then I discovered she was hurting more than I did I really thought that she eas okay. She had even begged her mom to stay in this country and go to college here  just to stay with me, sacrificing her future. But after we broke up, she told her mom she‚Äôd changed her decision and would go abroad again.

The guilt punched me hard.

I wanted to get back with her, but I knew what I did. On her birthday, I cried in front of her saying, ‚ÄúPlease come back. I can take LDR. I‚Äôll do anything to make this relationship work.‚Äù

And I truly meant it. I wanted a future with her.

I cried, completely forgetting about that.

The next day, we got back together. I gave my all. I was still lacking, but I resolved that I really wanted to marry this girl. I drove her home, sent her gifts like I always did, still keeping a straight face, completely forgetting about the cheating.

I still got jealous sometimes, demanded things yeah, I had the guts to be jealous after everything.

Now, I‚Äôm in this situation. We broke up yesterday because I poked the wound again.

It was my ex‚Äôs birthday, and my cousin wanted to give her flowers. He wanted me to buy them, and I agreed. I thought, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs given me gifts before; I‚Äôll just return the gesture one last time and cut her off forever.‚Äù

But I shouldn‚Äôt have even thought of helping.

I left a bad impression on my girlfriend. I said, ‚ÄúBabe, I‚Äôm gonna give my ex a gift because it‚Äôs her birthday.‚Äù she even agreed said it eas okay because it's her birthday completely thoughtless on what I've said ""I'm gonna"" even tho it was not mine and that left a bad impression out of it. I knew it wasn‚Äôt right to buy her flowers  but I did.

My sister, who‚Äôs friends with my ex, gave the flowers to her. She posted it, and my girlfriend saw it and it hurt her more. She thought I gave the flowers.

That gave my girlfriend the strength to talk to me about the mistake I made  that I cheated.

She already knew. She said, ‚ÄúYou made a fool out of me.‚Äù

And yeah, I really did.

She even thought she was the other woman  and that killed me. She had been thinking that all along but in my heart she was the only woman and I made her think that she was not enough and she was another woman.

I know I‚Äôm guilty. I know I don‚Äôt deserve her forgiveness. But I just know I‚Äôve changed  though the change came too late. My decisions led me here.

I considered confessing to her about it and made the decision it's best that some secrets stay even tho I said I dont want any pretty selfish ang narcissist right, but I was afraid of losing her. I know, so clich√©.

I‚Äôm not glorifying myself I know I fucked up. But I really can‚Äôt live without this woman anymore. I‚Äôm just some selfish boy.

I truly love her. I truly do.

This is the biggest mistake I‚Äôve made in my entire life. I just know this will haunt me until I die.

I‚Äôm still planning on pursuing her, seeking her forgiveness. I don‚Äôt want empathy. I‚Äôm sharing this because I‚Äôm a pathetic partner a fool and a cancer in her life.

I hurt her again, and she has research to do this month too. I fucking hate that I affected her academics. I‚Äôve always wanted her future to be bright. I hate myself for bothering her, for hurting her.

I‚Äôm just an empty shell right now. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I know what I‚Äôve done, and I can‚Äôt say or do anything. When I talk to her, I feel disgusted with myself.

I cheated.

I don‚Äôt know if you guys are even reading this. Like I said, I don‚Äôt want empathy. I‚Äôm truly guilty and aware of what I‚Äôve done.

Do I even deserve her?

But I‚Äôve really changed  even if it can‚Äôt erase the fact that I entertained another girl.

She was my first love. I hadn‚Äôt felt anything like this before. She was my first kiss, my first real love.

I love you, I‚Äôm so sorry.

I can‚Äôt live without you. Truly.

Do I even deserve forgiveness? I hate myself for what I‚Äôve done.

1o63f1h,Narcissism? Or Misunderstanding? Im 36 she's 28,So first off met a woman... we were getting along. Didn't see any flaws about her I mean she wasn't perfect... nobody is... and we started to date more etc. Cool... now I started to see flaws because of her ways... first off she can't work because of her circumstances... two she shows she's a lazy person and doesn't show determination.... anyways she broke up with me through text after holding a week grudge how I either speak my mind or correct her on things because sometimes she had childish behavior... and she think its acceptable but in reality I think people lied to her so she can feel validated not me. Nope..im gonna be honest from the jump not gonna hold grudges and still be all in your face with hugs and kisses and the lame ass I love you sayings..... so she broke up with me because she didn't like my personality... ok I guess but why is it I find out after you break up with me the things you didn't understand... we're adults not high school..... she told me I needed to get my shit together but she's the one not working or hustling or even job volunteering or nothing.... watch movies and walk the dogs... boring life but I accepted because I dont judge and like I said she have circumstances we're she can't work but dont tell me every other day youre having a lazy day....that's lame and unmotivated thing to say.... she didn't like how I talk to her sometimes thats because what she says seem like she's talking out her ass and not her brain.... I never yelled at her or touched her.... she said I made her feel like a dumbass.... wow how hmmmm but she changed soon as she broke up with me that day.... yelling at me on the phone...saying I need therapy just trying to suffocate me with her critic statements... she's been through some shit in life i mean who hasn't but for you to tell me I need therapy because you dont understand or can't cope with my personality doesn't mean you have the right to tell me what I need after we had sex.... I was at your house.... you didn't communicate the proper way to fix the relationship so im gonna assume I was your rebound from someone or you was just a hoe... I dont know... what do you guys think about this? By the way she waited a week before breaking up with me... I was at her house and hanging out... everything like nothing was wrong.... that's the fake shit I didn't understand at all... only strong through texting and phone calls but not in person ...,Affectionate_Pin4754,1760408312.0,1,0.99,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o63f1h/narcissism_or_misunderstanding_im_36_shes_28/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o63f1h/narcissism_or_misunderstanding_im_36_shes_28/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False

1o63c94,Unique (maybe) situation,"My (m37) and my ex (m36) recently broke up after 10 year together. We are still living together in a one bedroom apartment because he doesn't currently work and I dont want him out on the street. Hes been on the lease for the last 3 years but hasn't worked since we moved here. I currently pay all the bills, groceries, pay for our dog.

1o62xok,Lets start here.,"**Im not happy‚Ä¶**

These familiar words sting every time I see them put into that dreaded sentence. I feel like a failure every time I do. An unfriendly reminder that after so many years, yet again, I can‚Äôt anymore, another relationship over. It's gotten easier, the 1st one equated to 9 years with my high school sweetheart and a daughter (this one... his bitterness consumed her and I), my marriage ended after 6 years BUT we slept with each other off and on for 4 years (this one took everything I had, I barely made it), and then this latest one, 4 years today. However, this ended earlier this year and on good terms, such good terms it feels wrong. It's healthy and it feels wrong. (I can hear him now, ""the good guys always finish last, this is proof"" \*heavy Krusty the clown breath\*

There was something missing and I don‚Äôt know if it's always felt that way or the usual gradual build up, where I knew its not gonna work. However, I just kept on investing, I just kept on. I don‚Äôt think its out of loneliness, maybe out of hope, maybe because this was the first healthy relationship I had in my entire life...he says the same thing, that he hoped things would of gotten better, be better, change‚Ä¶ they don‚Äôt, they never do. You know the point, the point where the heaviness happens in your chest right before you go home to them, when you look at them and feel guilty for not feeling anything, when you pity them instead of love them or maybe when were kinder because we know that they love you more than you could ever, but its only at a point of realization that its over and it hits you in the most inconvenient moments. While out grocery shopping for dinner you'll make for the both of you, while washing their laundry, while having little too much fun with friends that you forget you have someone to go home to, while brushing your teeth and they quietly walk into the bathroom, talking, about something you can't hear because you look at them and you (I) feel nothing.....

\*airing my teary eyes\*

I had my mind made up months ago, we both did. We both understood. I did everything to help with the transition (i.e. starting his business, purchasing everything for it, filing everything for it, purchasing him a vehicle, and finding him an apartment)

While doing this there are stray moments of thoughts of his future I have fabricated in my mind of the woman he deserves, the life he deserves, and bitterly thinking that someone will enjoy the fruits of my labor, support and love. He will fuck her on the bed I bought him, ride around in the vehicle I purchased, be taken out on dates with the money from the business I still help him run, that should of been me... was me... but I made up my mind months ago so that stray moment I swat away. I did it because I love him and I learned early on that I was one of his biggest lessons in life...

Thus the beginning of me documenting the end of us.

You are starting at almost a years worth of words shared and feelings shared, however, he still lives with me and moves out next month. You are starting this journey mid chapter, in the middle of a book that either keeps you turning the page or loses you at the start.

I will embarrass myself, I will think I have everything under control, I will be sloppy, I will be raw, I will be steady, I will grow, I will be wild and I will exist how I exist in your mind due to my actions and you will either love me, tolerate me, or hate me.

1o62nsd,the story of my ex girlfriend and best friend,"i had a crush on a girl named hannah. ended up dating her for a few months. she was my everything for those few short months. we were best friends as kids, had sleepovers. when i realized i liked her, i realized i was bisexual. i sacrificed so much for her that first year. let her borrow my gym clothes because she wasn‚Äôt able to bring her own, whenever she needed a night away from her unforgiving family, my door was always open. freshman year of high school, i asked her out. i regret doing it now because that was the fall out of our relationship. i could tell she didn‚Äôt like me back the same way i liked her. our first kiss didn‚Äôt feel right. our first and only kiss. i ended it before we both got even more hurt. we went 3 years with no contact. we‚Äôre now seniors in high school, and i reached out again. turns out she didnt have the heart to tell me she was aroace, and didn‚Äôt want to crush me. she didn‚Äôt tell me this until i reached out those 3 years after our initial relationship. 

there was something there, in the beginning, but she was too afraid to act on it. she didn‚Äôt have a good support system growing up, and now i see it shows. i‚Äôve tried reaching back out, but she never seemed engaged in our conversations, so i stopped. my current partner tells me i should be her new support system, keep trying, but ive left her alone because she seems to want nothing to do with me anymore. i see her sometimes in the hall, give her a small smile, and want her to know i‚Äôll always be there for her. it never works, and i still pretend we never dated, just so i can have  some clarity that we can be friends again",Pitiful-Tower6994,1760406153.0,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o62nsd/the_story_of_my_ex_girlfriend_and_best_friend/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o62nsd/the_story_of_my_ex_girlfriend_and_best_friend/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False

1o62igs,I don‚Äôt even know how to move on from her,"

It‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve been in a real relationship ‚Äî about eight years ‚Äî and I‚Äôve had my share of partners, but this one was different. My ex  was someone I truly cared about and loved deeply. From the start it felt like something out of a movie. Our first date was perfect, we hung out three days in a row, and everything just clicked. I didn‚Äôt even care about the sex most of the time; I just loved being around her. I wanted kids with her. I wanted a future.

I did everything I could for her ‚Äî flowers, gifts, comfort when she was sick, on her period, when her cat died ‚Äî I stayed up with her all night while she cried. I was there emotionally, mentally, physically. But she‚Äôd go hours without replying even after saying she would. She‚Äôd go clubbing, post guys on her story saying she‚Äôd miss them, and I couldn‚Äôt ignore that. My trust issues kicked in hard. She said I disrespected her because I didn‚Äôt trust her, but she did things that made me doubt her.

We had our fights. She hit me a few times, and once I grabbed her just to calm her down. She called me names ‚Äî a piece of shit, worthless ‚Äî and I still stayed. I took it because I loved her and believed we could fix it. But it got worse. She said I broke her heart, that I ruined her self-esteem, and in the end, she called the cops on me. That destroyed me.

Now I just keep thinking about everything ‚Äî the dates, the little moments, the late-night cuddles, the words we said, how special she made me feel. I miss the girl I fell in love with, not the version she became when everything went downhill. I don‚Äôt even know how to stop thinking about her. I wake up with her on my mind and go to sleep the same way. I don‚Äôt feel like myself anymore.

Everyone tells me I dodged a bullet, but it doesn‚Äôt feel that way. It feels like I lost the person I was ready to build a life with. I don‚Äôt even know if she ever thinks about me, but I can‚Äôt stop thinking about her. I just wish I knew how to move on from someone who once felt like my entire world.

1o620a6,Ex (29 M) hasn‚Äôt replied in six days. Do I (27 F) take that as my answer?,"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm 27 and my ex is 29. We were together for five years. We bought a condo together about three years in, which made things more complicated.

Toward the end, I had several conversations with him about feeling like I wasn‚Äôt being prioritized and that I felt really alone. Communication became extremely difficult. I often felt unheard or dismissed. He had learned a lot of unhealthy communication habits from his father, especially in how he spoke to me. There were times when his tone felt condescending. It often felt like no matter how clearly I tried to express myself, the conversation would end up going nowhere.

It also felt like I was giving a lot of myself to the relationship while he was just taking. From my perspective, it felt very one-sided at times. I was putting in a lot of emotional effort to keep us connected and to make things work. Obviously, there were areas I could have improved on too, and I know I was not perfect.

There were also cultural differences. I‚Äôm Canadian and he comes from an Asian background, which brought its own challenges, especially with his parents‚Äô expectations and the pressure he felt from them. On top of that, he was unhappy in his career, which added to the stress and distance between us.

Ultimately, I ended the relationship because I felt my emotional needs weren‚Äôt being met anymore. When I left, he started telling me everything I had wanted to hear, but it didn‚Äôt feel genuine. The things that needed to change would have taken real time and effort to work through, and I didn‚Äôt feel that kind of commitment from him in that moment. At the time of leaving, it felt like the right thing to do. Now that I‚Äôve had time to reflect, I think these are things we could truly work through if we both tried hard enough.

It has been about six months since the breakup. During that time, I have done a lot of reflection and personal growth, but I still think about him. A few days ago, I decided to reach out to ask if he would be open to talking about us. 

It has now been six days and he hasn‚Äôt responded. I am not sure how to navigate what this means. If he does reply after a while, how do I decide what my boundaries are depending on how long it takes him? Is there a point where I just take the silence as my answer?

I would really appreciate advice from people who have been in similar situations. How did you decide when to stop waiting or when to still be open to communication?

TL;DR:
We were together for five years and had growing issues with communication, emotional effort, and cultural pressure. I ended things six months ago because I felt unheard and unprioritized. I‚Äôve since reflected and think our problems could‚Äôve been worked through. I recently reached out to see if he‚Äôd be open to talking, but it‚Äôs been six days with no response.

1o61ypz,Am I problem? Did I do the right thing?,"I (26F) broke up with my boyfriend (27M) of 3.5 years a couple of days ago, and I have never made a harder decision. We‚Äôve known each other since we were 18 and dated previously once for a little over a year and a half before breaking up for 2.5 years. When we first got back together everything was amazing, we moved in together a year and a half ago and things have been rocky the entire time. 

I have grown out of my drinking/partying/bar phase and he hasn‚Äôt. We‚Äôve talked about it and he says he wants to get better but every time he drinks he doesn‚Äôt come home (getting home between 10am and 5pm the next day depending on the day) and just looks through me when I try to ask him to come home with me. My mom came into town and I was crying begging him to just stay home that one night and he didn‚Äôt care and just left. I feel guilty for being the one who changed but he‚Äôs also escalated his drinking as well. 

I truly feel like he loves me as much as he can love someone but he just can‚Äôt prioritize me over his drinking and staying out all night with his friends. I have not always responded very well I‚Äôve yelled, screamed, called him mean names but I was just so sick of getting hurt by him over and over again. I hate the way I‚Äôve treated him but I‚Äôve been so sad and hurt and just didn‚Äôt handle my emotions correctly, he then says why would he want to come home to me when I‚Äôm so mean, to which I reply I wouldn‚Äôt be mean if you would just come home. I also have threatened breakups said we are broken up before which I know is fucked up and not healthy. 

We discussed some rules to make us both feel okay about him going out, my rules were as follows:
1. No strip clubs
2. No Drugs
3. Be home by 1am on weeknights and 4am on weekends
He frequently just doesn‚Äôt come home but as far as I know has never violated the first two. I feel like my rules are super fair and even our shared friends have agreed. 

I said we should break up a few days ago and he‚Äôs stayed out of our shared apartment except to sleep last night and I am keeping our dog but I just don‚Äôt want to break up. All of my friends have said it‚Äôs for the best but it feels like I am loosing the love of my life. In our 2.5 year separation I never once stopped loving him or moved on and I don‚Äôt want to lose him forever. I‚Äôm an anxious attachment style and he is avoidant and I don‚Äôt know what to do. We haven‚Äôt talked or gotten any closure at all. I want to tell him I want to get back together but I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs right or if he would even be willing to give it a shot. I want to go to couples therapy and figure our shit out, it‚Äôs killing me that I haven‚Äôt suggested therapy before just pulling the plug. I don‚Äôt know what to do or what is right I just feel like I am drowning and the only thing I want is him by my side.

I know she does not care or think about me anymore at all. When we were together she would act like she was embarrassed by me. She would act disgusted by me. She was unforgiving. She would never admit it but by the end, she enjoyed knowing how broken I was. 

I thought I was better and ready to move on. But maybe I‚Äôm not. I have contacted a therapist and hope to get help for this.

1o61m4x,Ex situationship reached out...,"I'm really looking for some advice here because I'm just so blind sided that this happened and I have no idea how to respond. I was involved with a guy for a few months, and he was genuinely the most kind-hearted person I've ever met. No one has made me laugh, smile and enjoy life more than this guy ever. I felt this immense connection I've never felt with anyone before with him, and I was fully comfortable with it, which is so out of the ordinary for me with someone. A couple of months in, he told me he didn't want anything serious (the first time he mentioned it in 2 months). After we had been texting constantly, he was the first person to wish me happy birthday, and we FaceTimed constantly. I was obviously upset, but he told me we could keep this going on MY timeline, so I could decide when to end. I agreed, cause why not? I really liked this guy, and he liked me too. We kept hanging out and he kept telling me there was no other girls in his life and that i was ""his girl"" which was really odd cause he would show me i was the only one he was talking to/wanted but didnt want to date... a week after he told me he didnt want to date he stopped talking to me as much which was really weird to me since we usually talked alot everyday. I confronted him about it, just wondering why, and he said it was cause he started to want to date me, so we couldn't talk or hang out anymore... I was devastated, but I had to try to move on with my life. I had to sleep on my couch for the week after that because my room just held memories of the best man I've ever met, and when I finally did decide to go back into my room, I was hit with dream after dream about him. Even now, a month later, he's all I think about. 

3 days ago, I was minding my own business when I decided to check his Instagram and saw that he had unfollowed me. I was upset but tried not to let it get me down. He then requested me, which, for some reason, I didn't see the notification for. Then, an hour later, he texts me out of nowhere (we had been no contact for a month) to apologize for unfollowing me? Cause he did it by accident when he was mass unfollowing a bunch of people. I haven't responded yet, but I just don't know how to take it. Personally, if that happened to me, I wouldn't text the person a heads up to know I'm following them back... i dont want to take it any deeper than it is but it seems a little off to me. Please let me know what you guys think.

1o61jby,"My girlfriend broke up with me over text during a wedding, and I feel completely blindsided","Hey everyone, I just need some advice or perspective because I can‚Äôt make sense of what happened.

My girlfriend (6 months together) broke up with me over text on Friday night - while I was at a wedding. No explanation, just ‚Äúwe are done.‚Äù

Our relationship had been amazing up until that point. The chemistry was insane - we both fell for each other hard and fast. It‚Äôs a long-distance relationship, but we made it work, seeing each other two weekends a month. She had known about this wedding since the beginning and had always been fine with me going alone.

The weekend before the wedding we saw each other, and everything felt perfect. It honestly felt like things were only getting stronger between us.

Here‚Äôs how it all went down:
	‚Ä¢	Wednesday: I was organizing plans with the guys for the wedding. I offered to call her that night, but she said she was fine just reading and having a quiet night.
	‚Ä¢	Thursday: I was driving most of the day and didn‚Äôt text much, but we did talk on the phone while she was on her way to work.
	‚Ä¢	Friday: Wedding day. I wasn‚Äôt on my phone much since I was with my mates at the reception.

At around 9:04 PM, she texted me. I didn‚Äôt see it straight away, and around 9:30 PM I opened Snapchat to watch a story one of my friends posted. She saw that I‚Äôd been online (she has my location) and messaged again, basically accusing me of ignoring her and talking to other people.

I explained that I was literally just checking a story and offered to prove it - even told her she could log into my account if she really wanted to. She said ‚Äúno‚Äù and that she‚Äôd talk to me tomorrow. I pushed for clarity because the reaction felt really over the top, and that‚Äôs when she said my ‚Äúeffort had been low since Wednesday.‚Äù

Which really stung, because she knew exactly how busy I was and I still made time to message and call whenever I could.

Then, out of nowhere, she just wrote ‚Äúwe are done‚Äù and blocked me on everything except iMessage. The next day she unblocked me on Instagram (no idea why), but I haven‚Äôt heard from her since.

I haven‚Äôt reached out and don‚Äôt plan to. I feel completely disrespected - she broke up with me during a wedding, through text, knowing I was far from home and had a 10-hour drive back that Sunday.

I gave my all to her. Treated her with absolute respect, loyalty, and care. And in the end, I got a three-word breakup message. I honestly don‚Äôt even know if her love was ever real at this point.

Has anyone gone through something like this? What do you make of her behavior? I‚Äôm torn between heartbreak and pure confusion right now.",Immediate-Respond-30,1760403008.0,2,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o61jby/my_girlfriend_broke_up_with_me_over_text_during_a/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o61jby/my_girlfriend_broke_up_with_me_over_text_during_a/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o61cm5,How do I stop idolizing the idea of us getting back together?,Her(22) and I(m26) had a really healthy respectful breakup. I will admit a couple weeks after I did try and fight for her but then I told her we needed to go no contact so she said she can respect that and we let it go. I mean I did get drunk and blow up her phone 2 days after which resulted in her blocking me but now I‚Äôm completely unblocked lol. But my biggest issue is idolizing the idea of us getting back together one day. That was talked about when we broke up because she said (if it‚Äôs meant to be we will find our way back to each other). I‚Äôve been doing my healing and finding myself again but not fully since it‚Äôs been 1.5 months since the breakup and I know I need more time. But for some reason especially when I‚Äôm alone in my thoughts at night or driving I just start to idolize us finding our way back to each other. I love her a lot but know now is not our time. There hasn‚Äôt been any contact for over 20 days now and at first it was hard but now it‚Äôs easier but I still have my moments when I want to hear from her.

1o611i0,I love her so much I had to let her go (Help)!!!,"Me (F22) and my gf (F23) broke up 10 days ago. I‚Äôve gone back and forth about it for a while and I feel terrible. I broke up with her because we had been horribly fighting on and off for atleast the past 3 months. We were together for 1.5 years, started dating ldr and i flew out to see her 3 separate times last year. She recently made the decision to go back overseas for school in January for the next 2 years. We‚Äôve had so many good memories and laughs, we are really close, best friends, soulmates, love each other so so much, etc. However, we moved in together way too fast both with unresolved traumas from either childhood or past relationships. She had cheated on me within the first month (May) of us dating during a very vulnerable time of my life. It happened in between going from the psych ward to a rehab facility, where I didn‚Äôt have my phone for multiple days and the landlines wouldn‚Äôt do international calls. I didn‚Äôt find out until last November before I went to go see her a third time. Since I love her so much I believed I could make it work and push through it, yet the feelings of betrayal since this has happened in my last 2 only relationships kept resurfacing. We both have a slew of mental illnesses, most prominently bipolar 2 and BPD. She also has been verbally and emotionally abusive/manipulative at times, said some things to me I would have never imagined. But in the end I love her more than I can comprehend. We are presumably going no contact for now, but both have hope of rekindling in the far future, once we have both grown. I can‚Äôt stop feeling like it‚Äôs all my fault, even though I haven‚Äôt done anything to her or been in the wrong for this decision.

1o61010,My karma ?,"Sorry...long one ( Putting my heart out) I am 28F living in foreign country for abt 4 years, who hasn't been in a relationship ever in life owing to several reasons- environment, exposure, circumstances and thought in initial years about getting independent first.
5 months ago, I met someone over dating site. I am pretty old school for that kinda stuff but it felt great. The idea of having someone mine filled my heart with ecstasy. In hindsight, I think was it him or the idea of having someone as ur partner who will love u and care for you ?

We talked for a month. He was 7 hours away from me and didn't drive for some reasons. Initially, I was hesitant but then we expressed our feelings and felt attached. He happened to be at a friend's place in a nearby city and decided to meet. I picked him up and went for a buffet. Next day he was at other friend's place - we again met. And that's all for meeting.

Amd rest on calls. In the next month itself, he would talk as a formality over a call in the evening as a duty and not out of real willingness as a partner. He was critical of pimples on my face,pointed out how his hand was a little more fair than me,never talked about my stuff or advancement, always vented out what he was going through in life and at his rented place. 90 percent of the time was his vent out and 10 percent of us. During that month, I got into a car accident, and after knowing he casually texted after 3 hours and after my response, another 2 hours.
He was moody and toxic and never showed care or thought about me but always said that he cared when topic came. Our timelines for marriage differed ad what we had discussed in initial phase and it didn‚Äôt work out .


On and off, I cry and always think when he comes back after his things were sorted and was ready for relationship- I want to be bold and say - I don't deserve u and u don't deserve me.
Last 3 days, I have been noticing that I start to cry thinking of that no matter what place I am. How do I reassure myself that God has better plans and I don‚Äôt want to be there for someone who  called me the love of his life and will leave me to destiny !
I think it feels like betrayal or how stupid I am to let someone be so mean to me....I spent way more in terms of money for food, mileage, atleast 7 hours of driving as I did pick and drop from different cities 2 days and spent hours thinking about him.
All emotions, thoughts and more like I had not called someone with cute names like that before ..
Spent more in terms of mental drainage or vent of someone else, made myself available emotionally which is still there as a scar !

1o60pri,I'm still in love with him 3 weeks later....,"I'm here to have some good advice to look up to... Because when I love someone I love really really hard. To the point I have to becareful next time not to ever lose myself again cause the break up has put me through hellish pain. The heartache, the pain, the nonstop tears were immense.

My best friend made a list for me why I SHOULDN'T chase him anymore and why I should NEVER get back with him EVEN if he comes back in the future. (My best friend believes he will never come back anyway so she is trying to destroy even the smallest hope I have so it finally STOPS hurting me...

My friends list of NOT TO GET BACK TOGETHER REMINDER:

1) Intellectually below me
2) he abandoned the relationship WHILE in it
3) he strung you along and didn't have the balls to leave and be honest
4) Incapable of processing and communicating his feelings
5) he didn't fight for me
6) did less than the bare minimum
7) he is emotionally immature 
8) he gaslit you and loved bombed you into falling for him
9) you guys don't have anything in common
10) he can't take care of himself or his diabetes
11) unmotivated 
12) gives up easy
13) teenager living in a mans body
14) didn't work on his trust issues from his past that he had before he got with you, kept exploding on me

Anyway that was the list and that was a short version... And yet why do I still love him? Is it trauma bond? I truly loved him it drove me insane.. I'm hurt right now. Deeply.  And for someone reason Im ignoring the list cause I still love him. Im trying to stop being so stubborn 

Is it bad that I want him to heal and eventually come back to me..?. Is it bad I want him to come back with regret just so I can feel any type of form of validation? But I'm worried until then it will be too late for me cause I'd probably move on... Which I hope I do! Cause it HURTS SO MUCH. I don't know what to do. I'm fighting myself :(

1o60p83,Letter to J,"I don‚Äôt even know where to start, because everything we lived was so intense, so big, that sometimes it still feels impossible that it‚Äôs really over.
But it is and even if I don‚Äôt want to, I‚Äôm learning to accept it.

Loving you was, for a long time, the center of my world.
And I know I truly loved you, in the kind of way that only happens once, when you still believe love alone can fix everything.
I loved you with the innocence of someone who believes in forever, and the strength of someone who gives everything they have inside.
And even now, after all this time and pain, there‚Äôs still a part of me that wishes it could be you.

But love by itself isn‚Äôt enough when the other person keeps running from their own feelings.
You were always afraid to face what you‚Äôd done, to sit with the weight of your actions.
You preferred to rationalize, to run, to erase and maybe you even believe that‚Äôs how you survive.
But I wasn‚Äôt made to run.
I was made to feel, to dive deep, to face what hurts and still choose to heal.

That‚Äôs why your absence shattered me so much.
Because I stayed, staring at what was left, trying to understand, holding onto memories like broken glass.
You, on the other hand, moved on.
I don‚Äôt know if with someone else or on your own, but you did.
And even if it sometimes seems like you‚Äôre the one who won, deep down I know you‚Äôre the one who‚Äôs stuck.
Stuck in fear, in guilt, in the inability to truly live something real.

I‚Äôve cried enough for both of us.
I cried for us, for the future we never had, for the little girl who never came to be, for the home that only existed in my imagination.
And now, I‚Äôm letting you go along with all of it.
Not because I stopped loving you, but because I realized love can‚Äôt survive alone, and mine doesn‚Äôt deserve to keep begging for space in a heart that stays closed.

One day, maybe you‚Äôll look back and miss me, maybe you‚Äôll even regret it.
But I won‚Äôt be waiting anymore.
Because I deserve someone who stays.
Someone who doesn‚Äôt run when it hurts, who doesn‚Äôt give up when it‚Äôs hard.
Someone who looks at me with the same love and courage I once had for you.

Today, I don‚Äôt hate you.
But I also don‚Äôt idealize you anymore.
Today, I see that you were the hardest lesson of my life and maybe, for that very reason, the most necessary one.
Because with you I learned what it means to lose myself, and without you I‚Äôll learn what it means to become myself again.

Goodbye. Not with anger, but with peace.
Because I finally understand that endings don‚Äôt erase love, they transform it.
And I‚Äôm ready to transform mine into freedom.

After months of being lead on by my girlfriend, she finally decided to end our relationship yesterday. It sucks and I'm thinking about her even more than before, but I've finally been able to start sleeping and dreaming again.

For the last 2 months, I've been getting no more than 3-4 hours of sleep a day - most day less. - but  last night, I slept a full 7 hours and am able to nap and go back to sleep today.

1o5zuj1,Just walked away after 2 years.,"My ex finally started to text me after around a year and a half after he left for a different continent, I would reach out every 2 months to check in with no response and tell him God loves him, and I‚Äôm here if he needs me.
I stopped reaching out for 5 months, I missed him everyday and checked his profile it was exhausting and we started talking again for like a day and a half texting back and forth.
I tried to create some distance, and then the next day just checked in again to tell him I hope he‚Äôs doing well because he told me how he went through a traumatic experience the day we talked and that I am praying for him. 
He texted me a lot around 30 minutes later telling me about his day tonight, but I ended up telling him I couldn‚Äôt text him anymore. My heart is to heavy, I told him I‚Äôm always here if life gets hard and he needs to talk and to keep himself safe, but I realized that he never reached out to me or texted me first since he left. And I just want to feel loved, I know his attachment isn‚Äôt  at the same level mine is and I don‚Äôt know how to feel. I feel regretful, In pain, weird, I feel uncomfortable. I have had no friends for years, so I hold onto my memories of him and loving him and can‚Äôt control it.

I know it sounds so dumb, do you think I made the right choice? It just didn‚Äôt seem plausible to continue talking, I know he isn‚Äôt feeling the same as me and I‚Äôm to traumatized.

1o5zrfy,What happens after a breakup?,"Can anyone talk me through what happens when you separate from your partner you live with and have a child with please...

We (me 28F, him 36M) have a 1 year old and tonight have decided to have some time apart so he will likely stay with family for a bit but realistically I think we will separate. Feel like it's going to be a really slow process with him finding somewhere else to live and moving his stuff out of the house, making arrangements for when he will have our child etc. 

I'm not trying to rush him off or anything, it's a sad breakdown of relationship that boils down to us just having outgrown each other and needing to learn how to be ourselves again. There's no bad feelings and I want to stay as amicable as possible.

1o5zrer,Why did I not feel sad?,For context my girlfriend and I broke up 3 months ago after being together for around 5 months. She was acting weird the days leading up to the breakup not talking to me for hours on end when we would talk constantly before. I thought it was just because she was busy with work and she was helping a friend move. I ended up going to a mutual friend of ours asking if she was ok since she hadn't spoken to me in over 2 days. a few hours after this mutual reassured me that everything was going to be ok I get a text from my girlfriend telling me we needed to talk. We ended up breaking up that night with her hanging up and telling me to leave her alone and I felt upset but the tears felt forced. By the next day I was feeling ok. There was still a sting to it but I ended up going to the gym with one of my buddies to keep my mind off of things. The gym was closed since it was so late at night and we ended up chilling in the parking lot and he told me he knew some things about how it was the friend that she was helping move who convinced her to break up with me. fast foreword a few weeks and my ex sends me a text saying she was sorry and hoped to still stay friends. I only felt upset for a few hours after she broke up with me. Why did I not feel sad over this when this girl who I loved with all of my heart broke up with me out of the blue?

1o5zpj9,"My girlfriend of eight years broke up with me claiming it was her aromantic-ness. I feel bad saying this, but I dont think it was.","My ex (24F) and I (24F) had been together eight, maybe nine years. I dont recall exactly. It was for the most part a very happy relationship. We loved each other, visited whenever we could and it overall felt stable. We helped each other through everything. Until a week ago.

About a month ago she admitted something to me that practically caused our relationship to break down in that very moment. Eight years of hard work collapsed.

My ex is into feral porn. 

This is a major red flag for me and I told her so. I told her she  needs to get therapy because she was experiencing major intrusive thoughts of fucking animals. While I didn't label her anything like a zoophile at the time it still weirded me out knowing she experiences this. I know what intrusive thoughts are like and I know while theyre hard to entirely remove they can be helped with therapy.

Two weeks go by. I hadn't heard anything about the therapy. I hadn't heard anything about the feral at all. I'd assumed oh maybe shes not telling me as therapy is a very private thing. Ive been to therapy before and I understand its not something you want to tell everyone about. 

A friend messages me out of the blue. He tells me his partner is asking him to block me on all accounts. I knew his partner didn't like me but I never knew why, we'd never interacted before so I just assumed it was my age or something.

It was my wife. 

She had rebranded her account to be feral porn focused and was aegidly using dogwhistles so other feral porn enjoyers knew. She'd also entirely changed her artstyle so it was VERY CLEARLY feral. I had her in my bio but her account muted as she reposted a lot of porn so I didn't know of this.

I confronted her. I asked her about the therapy, about the red flag, about the intrusive thoughts. She told me she didnt want therapy anymore. That being into feral was a part of her. If I couldn't accept that the relationship was over. 

Cue us fighting for three days. I wanted to fix things (I loved her a lot) and kept trying to make compromises that benefited us both. But she never tried. She complained about how there were too many problems and how she was so overwhelmed and how it was too much. And then she decides rather than trying to fix it.. its over.

She claimed she'd been planning this breakup for a while. She just didnt know how to go through with it and this argument was a way for us to split even if not peaceful.

She also casually drops the bombshell of:
I never loved you. Our relationship was built on a lie for eight years.

All of this started because she decided her weird friends (shes in a server full of people who are open about fetishes such as incest) told her ""Hey its okay to be into feral"". She chose it over our relationship and made it an ultimatum but claims me saying that makes me the asshole because shes aromantic.

Please somebody tell me im not going insane I genuinely dont know how to feel. Were not on speaking terms as we had another fight over it in which she revealed shes been stalking my private twitter account ever since we broke up but thats a whole other can of worms. I just need to know whether im valid in thinking she broke up not because of her aromantic feelings shes had for years and rather because I couldn't accept her being into feral porn. We never properly talked it out so I feel stumped.

1o5zo06,Getting back with my ex was the best decision in my entire life,"This might be contrary to everyone else‚Äôs opinion, but in my experience, getting back with my ex has been absolutely magical we both got time to grow as people and as long as you don‚Äôt break up for the wrong reasons such as she cheated on you, (in my situation, we broke up because she had moved to another state that‚Äôs nearby and also I gave her chlamydia lol) , here we are three years later back together and better than ever. We just had so much time to grow individually as people and if you know that this person is the person for you in your heart you know that then it‚Äôs not worth throwing that away to look for love somewhere else. I will say acting crazy and trying to make your ex feel bad for you or stalking her is not gonna get her back but if you grow as a person and become better than bam out of nowhere, maybe she‚Äôll come crawling back to you and your love will be that much stronger if you can get over the hate of the things u both did when u where apart. We almost broke up again recently and I literally genuinely felt like I was dying for a week and I‚Äôm not a guy that has trouble getting other girls sometime. Is there something in your heart and your soul that tells you this person a person for you then it‚Äôs worth making it work out and not jumping a gun to try and forget this person but only if that person still loves you as well And a lot of time they still do but they just have someone else in their ear or their ego is a bit too high to admit themselves. I‚Äôve never ever not had to come crawling back to me given enough time.

1o5zn92,Is this a good idea,"So I‚Äôve posted about this before, my ex girlfriend and I broke up Sept 10
I was weak and kept trying to get her back all the way up to like October 10, she‚Äôs avoidant and it was only making it worse.
When we broke up she stated how great and sweet I was, but that she couldn‚Äôt subject herself to my anxiety & insecurities anymore, which I understand. But I hope she can see that those are things I‚Äôve been able to work on and that there is hope for a future.
We had a good relationship with some issues + the main one being my insecurities, now I have genuinely understood these and am growing as a more secure person and closer to God.
She was also trying to become closer to God while we dated, but im a little more late to it, but I think im taking it more seriously now than she is.
Since the breakup, she has been going out, talking to old & new guys, etc. so I know she probably hasn‚Äôt given me much thought apart from shutting down my ideas of trying to get back together.
Even though we had a great relationship, I feel like now that she has been seeking other guys (within days after the breakup all the way to now, 3-4 days after we broke up she unblocked her exes and followed them, and then there was more guys since then) that she isn‚Äôt going to really want me back anymore.

I‚Äôm thinking in a couple days, where it will have been a close to a week of not contacting whatsoever, to just drop off some of her favorite food that she can‚Äôt get where she lives at college, and a hand written letter with flowers to her dorm. In the letter I stated I don‚Äôt want to rush anything, but wish to make it work when the time is right. She was supposed to go away this weekend with her mom & some family, and her mom loved me so im hoping maybe she brings it up to her and they talk about it. 
I don‚Äôt know if this will continue to push her farther, or maybe make her think more on it since I‚Äôve went silent for around a week at that point. She seems to have already moved on with other guys, even though like 2 days before she broke up with me she talked about marriage. So I feel like it‚Äôs just distraction and deep down she knows we could workout. I‚Äôm not sure though, I hope it just plants a seed in her brain, and maybe on my birthday on the 28th she reaches back out.
Am I too hopeful?
I‚Äôm going to try and keep it realistic to myself knowing she is most likely gone for good, but I have hopes too.

1o5zc3w,What are my options,"My now ex broke up with me a week ago. I‚Äôm just trying to make sense of it all. We had a pretty rough three weeks. Where we had a couple arguments about some future life things and I guess she didn‚Äôt like where it was going and ended things. 

She told me she didn‚Äôt fall out of love  and that she still cared about me a lot, she said she just needs to work on herself and that things between us weren‚Äôt working at this moment and that if we meet again and things are meant to work out, they will I don‚Äôt wanna wait though.

I see all these things saying don‚Äôt text her. Wait for her to text back.  I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm gonna do that. I‚Äôm gonna give her space at this time cause I know it‚Äôs right too and I‚Äôm really gonna take this time to work on myself if she‚Äôs genuine about that. I just it‚Äôs so fresh and I can‚Äôt get over all these thought. Thoughts about other things in my head.

The biggest factor is that we work together  we didn‚Äôt work together prior to getting together, it‚Äôs a small town so it just happened to be by coincidence and that is still not a problem we‚Äôre both very respectful about our jobs and keeping personal and workplace problems separate 

But to me that might be the hardest part  as I have to see her every day acting normal like nothing‚Äôs wrong I have to talk to her and I feel like it throws the idea out the window of letting her feel out her emotions so I‚Äôm really just torn between what to do I want with everything to get back with her and make things work and I wish I just knew what to say to make it better

While we were together, we had a very strong relationship no trust issues never had to worry about anything she was doing. She never had to worry about anything I was doing. We never had any arguments and my thoughts are just when we did. We weren‚Äôt ready to communicate properly. And I feel like I‚Äôm open enough to wanna work on those things and I don‚Äôt think she was just ready for that. 

I‚Äôm just kinda seeking advice on how things should go for me the next couple of months I kinda made a idea for myself that I‚Äôm gonna wait for 3 to 4 months before I reach out again just to give her some time  but I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm gonna work on myself. That‚Äôs all I know for now.

Edit: just to put it into perspective there is no agreement of no contact and she said I could contact her and text her and she would respond I don‚Äôt know how to take that either",ScallionGrand1229,1760397007.0,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o5zc3w/what_are_my_options/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o5zc3w/what_are_my_options/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False

1o5z18e,"I feel drained. My boyfriend (28M) keeps crossing lines with his girl friend (30F, engaged).","Hi guys. I (23F) just really need to let this out. I love my boyfriend so much. We‚Äôve been together for 3 years. He‚Äôs sweet, affectionate, emotionally intelligent, and always talks about building a future with me. Pero minsan, he‚Äôs too friendly, especially with one girl friend from work.

This girl (30F) is already engaged and getting married soon. I‚Äôve met her before. She‚Äôs nice naman, pero super touchy sa guy friends niya, like holding hands and being extra close. She chats with my boyfriend a lot, sends selfies, random updates, gym pics, food, and just talks to him constantly.

I told my boyfriend that I feel uncomfortable. I didn‚Äôt tell him to stop talking to her, I just asked him to set boundaries.

Then one time, she visited their office after resigning and they had lunch alone. He only told me after it happened, and even asked if he could drop her off. I said ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs up to you,‚Äù hoping he‚Äôd respect how I felt, but he still did it.

Later on, I found out she‚Äôd been messaging him again, sharing her relationship problems through Instagram DMs in disappearing messages. I saw it when I checked his inbox. At first, he said it was about a mutual friend, but later admitted it was actually about her fianc√©. He said it was a ‚Äúsensitive topic‚Äù he couldn‚Äôt share with me. What really hurt me was that he lied about it.

Recently, she messaged again asking to meet their old friends. My boyfriend asked if he could go, even if he already knows how I feel about her. That‚Äôs when I broke down. I cried so hard. I‚Äôve forgiven him so many times, but this time I just felt‚Ä¶ nothing.

As in nothing. Not even love. Just emptiness. He was crying too, but I couldn‚Äôt feel anything anymore. He‚Äôs really sorry now and admitted that he was being insensitive, that it was his fault. His birthday is coming up soon, but I honestly can‚Äôt bring myself to plan anything or make him feel special right now.

I still love him, but I‚Äôm so emotionally drained. I don‚Äôt even know if there‚Äôs anything left to save. I just needed to get this off my chest.

1o5yq0x,is it too soon to reach out?,"


(i uploaded this earlier but my acct was reported for spam so)

Hey all, to give context to everything I guess I‚Äôll copy-paste the same thing I sent to a friend: to be clear, SHE broke up with me. she‚Äôd been telling me for weeks prior that she‚Äôs been having doubts about our relationship, because she just felt that we expressed love and received love differently. meaning she‚Äôd felt unappreciated for the last few weeks. in her words, she appreciates/feels loved when  i would do things (like taking her on dates, making gifts, etc) without her having to ask, the bare minimum. that‚Äôs also something that makes me feel really loved, and she had been doing a great job at doing that. i used to be really good at that until freshman year came around. we dated all throughout that (and about a year prior) until she broke it off not long into sophomore year. like i mentioned before, she‚Äôd told me she‚Äôs been having doubts and talked about how she felt unappreciated weeks/a few months before she broke up with me. i selfishly didnt really take her seriously and never made much of an effort to actually do that more and listen to her, hence why she broke things off. 

since the beginning of sophomore year, I never got into the cycle of meeting a lot of people, and hence didn‚Äôt make a ton of friends. i had many many bouts of depression relating to that and would often just cling to her to cope w that. the issue was that i started to ‚Äúslack off‚Äù for lack of better terms, never really making any plans for us at all. we spent the majority of the time just going to one another‚Äôs dorms and hanging out, but that was kinda it. if i had to guess i think she was frustrated w the lack of quality attention she used to get from me, often taking her on weekly dates, creating fun weekend plans, etc.
      i‚Äôve just been super frustrated with myself after reflecting on everything. i was really selfish those last few weeks and probably months of our relationship, and had been going through a lot on my own that i never talked to her about. i think all the stuff going on with me personally built up which made me neglect people like her.
      something else she brought up was how she felt like she was always coming to me w problems, and i never did the same. meaning that she would often talk to me about things she was uncomfortable or upset about and i (maybe twice) never really did myself. tha left her feeling super guilty about asking for change from me, since she was forced to hold most of the emotional stress of our relationship. i also realized upon reflection that i think that when i did have an issue i wanted to bring up, it would stew inside me and build resentment towards her, which is why i tried less and less to make change myself, which of course was never fair.
      what really messes with me is that i feel like we had a really really good relationship for almost 2 years. we both loved eachother so much and spent so much time together. we would always talk about our future together and we loved to plan things like what our future house would look like, things we‚Äôd do when we‚Äôd be married; and she always seemed so adamant and excited to be with me. i recognize how stupid it was to jeopardise our relationship for so long especially considering how important she is to me and i don‚Äôt think ill ever live down those regrets. what im trying to say is that i feel awful about everything that i did, or didnt do. and i completely understand why she felt like she had to end everything. but i feel like what we had is worth working on to try and make it work again.
       it‚Äôs super easy for me to say that, and selfish considering i was the problem, and everything that followed was the consequence of my actions. it‚Äôs just so hard for me to move on because i really felt like we were meant for eachother, and im confident she felt that way too. what im trying to say is that i want to work on myself so that i can get to a point where maybe we could start again. i‚Äôve started talking to a therapist about communicating my feelings better, and started journaling to reflect on my emotions and thoughts so that i can try to understand everything better. and i know it‚Äôs so selfish of me to want her back, and maybe that just isn‚Äôt possible. 
      an update since originally writing this:
i reached out about a week after we broke up and we talked a bit about checking in on one another. she even mentioned that she missed our friendship a lot. our conversation finished w her telling me that it was difficult for her to talk right now and that she‚Äôd try reaching out again soon.
     it‚Äôs been about a month and we haven‚Äôt spoken to one another, i‚Äôve done a ton of reflection and created a growth timeline for myself. it‚Äôs so hard not to reach out again but that feels like im invading boundaries. she seems happy right now, granted i don‚Äôt really know that.

Should I reach out again soon? I want more than anything to start over and treat her the way she should‚Äôve always been treated, I also keep telling myself that we will get back together (mainly because of just how devoted we were to eachother) but in the event that that‚Äôs just not possible, I want to move on, and know that for certain.",throwawaybutsadasl,1760395441.0,4,0.84,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o5yq0x/is_it_too_soon_to_reach_out/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o5yq0x/is_it_too_soon_to_reach_out/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False

1o5yp2f,Thankful,"This isn‚Äôt necessarily about my ex but more so her parents. Its been exactly 1 month since we broke up and it‚Äôs Canadian Thanksgiving and I‚Äôd like to send my exes parents a thank you message for how welcoming they were to me when I was with their daughter.

I‚Äôve been battling these thoughts because of 2 main reasons. 

1. When my ex (25F) and I (25M) broke up, I asked her if it would be alright for me to message her mom saying thank you for welcoming me into their home, treating me as one of their own, supporting me, etc. She said no since her mom would be ‚Äúuncomfortable‚Äù with me messaging her after the break up. Which didn‚Äôt make sense to me since she loved me. Her mom was always excited to see me, asking when I‚Äôd be around next, what dessert I‚Äôd be making for their daughter next.  

2. I was questioning whether I was doing this because being appreciative and grateful is part of who I am. Or if I was trying to have some sort of mental cushion that I was ‚Äúa good one‚Äù in their eyes or that they‚Äôd think highly of me in the future. I eventually argued with my buddy who has a masters in psychotherapy about how this is a part of who I am and that showing appreciation and gratitude mean a lot to me. If someone helps me, especially the ones I care about, I want them to know that their time and effort mattered to me, it mattered enough to let them know that I truly value what they‚Äôve done for me.

Even though I‚Äôm pretty certain that this is me and that I don‚Äôt have an ulterior motives like seeming better in their eyes, winning her back, or some other bullshit.

1o5ymgb,How do I move on?,"This is a throwaway account but I just need to vent somehwere. I broke up with my boyfriend of nine months back in May. A very long story short but I did not feel truly seen or heard by him when I had concerns, especially when it came to his friends (one of them who happened to be my roommate for a year who treated me and my other roommate terribly that I won't get into). An example is I got my nipples pierced and his roommate made the comment that ""if it were me i would show them off because they're cute imo"" (mind you his girlfriend is that roommate) and when I told my then boyfriend I was uncomfortable and that it was weird he said that to me, he brushed it off and i essentially had to beg him to agree with me that it was weird. I later brought this up to him and asked what he would've done if that was said to his sister and he said that he would've have fought him and I asked why he didn't do that for me and his response was ""well I trust you wouldn't cheat on me"" and when I explained that this was not even remotely close to why I was upset, it just didn't seem to really click with him. He also was late to give me a gift for my birthday (I am not trying to sound ungrateful he didn't have to get me a gift but it was the fact that he had told me that he was going to work on it during our spring break and didn't give it to me until a month and a half later because he spent all of break gaming even though he had an entire free week and I told him that was one thing that bothered me when we were having a serious conversation; to me at that point it was not about the physical gift but more about the principle of it; it was a 3D printed gift and I know those things take time but from the time it took from me telling him I was upset about it to a re-visit of that conversation because of other things, it took him like 3 days to make it). He also never said he loved me back when I said it to him 5 months into dating and up until the end he still never said it back. Essentially I just felt very disregarded and only seen as a title in this relationship and I broke it off with him in May. After explaining my feelings for like the 5th time to him, he thought it was because he wasn't good enough which was not it at all. I just felt like I wasn't important or that I was just replaceable. Despite all of this though, he was the best boyfriend I have ever had and I miss him so much. It feels like a physical emptiness is in me everyday and I feel like I can't get over him. I immerse myself in my classwork, spend as much time with my friends as I can, put a lot of my energy into work, but when it comes to the end of the day I feel so alone. It also doesn't help that literally all my friends and just everyone around me is either in a long-term relationship or engaged or something. I guess I am just looking for advice on how to just move forward, especially since we go to the same university and also live literally right across the parking lot from each other so I see his place all the time. He did reach out to me in June and we had a very quick text convo catching up, but that was it. I've also been dating here and there but I just feel like no one compares to when i was with him. I was also SA'd in August and it makes it even harder because my ex was such a safe person in that regards and I just find it do hard and taxing to try and trust others. Sorry for a long post and kind of being all over the place, but if anyone has any advice or anything like that, that would be great.",Haunting_Purchase821,1760395185.0,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o5ymgb/how_do_i_move_on/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o5ymgb/how_do_i_move_on/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o5yk4s,Day 1 of Breakup - 5 month Relationship,"22F here. I feel so lonely, a mix of so many emotions right now. He broke up with me because he wasn't emotionally ready for a relationship anymore. We got together after he got out of a 3 year relationship that was toxic. Last night, he said he was lost and didn't know what to do. He cried to me when I told him I wish he loved me. I miss him. The last 2 weeks of being with him I felt so abandoned and unloved. I compromised so many of my emotions and tried to tell myself ""maybe I'm just overthinking everything."" He said he would be there for me during hard times. I don't think he realized what actual hard times looked like. 

I don't want to get back together with someone who abandoned me and made me feel so unloved and lonely, but it hurts so bad. I don't understand how someone who loved you does something like that, I've come up with so many answers to why, but I understand the importance of healing and not wanting to drag someone through something harmful. I'm glad he cut things off now rather than realizing it married when I've got postpartum depression. But still, I just.. don't understand how you can care and love someone and leave like that. Why wouldn't he want to work things out together?

I am fighting a mix of anger, sadness, and loneliness. I'll occassionally feel a weight lifted off of me, but then it just comes back over me like a wave. I don't want to sulk in this. A part of me wants to find someone who will be there for me emotionally, but I know I need to heal. It's hard to stay in that strong confident mood I find myself in occassionally. Can anyone convince me not to attempt to start another romantic relationship with someone?

It's been three months of pure hell, white knuckling it every day, trying to stop myself from checking their social media, trying to belive that the pain would eventually fade. But last night, the grief just hit me so hard. I couldn't breathe. I started spiraling, convinced I must have misunderstod everything, that maybe they still m33ed me. I just wanted a sign.

I remembered a blurry old photo my ex, Chris, had deleted almost immediately after posting it years ago, a silly picture from our very first trip together. My mind just went blank with desperation..... I acted on pure implse. I grabbed that picture and, without even thinking, typed **face-seek** into the browser just to see if it would surface an old, unused account they forgot to scrub. I was looking for a ghost of our past.

I didn't find a ghost. I found a public comment thred on an obscure local community page. It wasn't them, but the person who replied was. It was Chris‚Äôs new partner. And their comment referenced a trip, a weekend trip Chris told me they had to go on *alone* for a ""family emergency"" just two weeks before they ended things with me. The dates lined up perfectly. They were already together....

It wasn't about finding them happy now. It was about seeing the lie. Knowing that for those two weeks, they were already building that new life while they were still telling me they loved me.

1o5xjr1,Is is too soon to reach out?,"
Hey all, to give context to everything I guess I‚Äôll copy-paste the same thing I sent to a friend: to be clear, SHE broke up with me. she‚Äôd been telling me for weeks prior that she‚Äôs been having doubts about our relationship, because she just felt that we expressed love and received love differently. meaning she‚Äôd felt unappreciated for the last few weeks. in her words, she appreciates/feels loved when  i would do things (like taking her on dates, making gifts, etc) without her having to ask, the bare minimum. that‚Äôs also something that makes me feel really loved, and she had been doing a great job at doing that. i used to be really good at that until freshman year came around. we dated all throughout that (and about a year prior) until she broke it off not long into sophomore year. like i mentioned before, she‚Äôd told me she‚Äôs been having doubts and talked about how she felt unappreciated weeks/a few months before she broke up with me. i selfishly didnt really take her seriously and never made much of an effort to actually do that more and listen to her, hence why she broke things off. 

since the beginning of sophomore year, I never got into the cycle of meeting a lot of people, and hence didn‚Äôt make a ton of friends. i had many many bouts of depression relating to that and would often just cling to her to cope w that. the issue was that i started to ‚Äúslack off‚Äù for lack of better terms, never really making any plans for us at all. we spent the majority of the time just going to one another‚Äôs dorms and hanging out, but that was kinda it. if i had to guess i think she was frustrated w the lack of quality attention she used to get from me, often taking her on weekly dates, creating fun weekend plans, etc.
      i‚Äôve just been super frustrated with myself after reflecting on everything. i was really selfish those last few weeks and probably months of our relationship, and had been going through a lot on my own that i never talked to her about. i think all the stuff going on with me personally built up which made me neglect people like her.
      something else she brought up was how she felt like she was always coming to me w problems, and i never did the same. meaning that she would often talk to me about things she was uncomfortable or upset about and i (maybe twice) never really did myself. tha left her feeling super guilty about asking for change from me, since she was forced to hold most of the emotional stress of our relationship. i also realized upon reflection that i think that when i did have an issue i wanted to bring up, it would stew inside me and build resentment towards her, which is why i tried less and less to make change myself, which of course was never fair.
      what really messes with me is that i feel like we had a really really good relationship for almost 2 years. we both loved eachother so much and spent so much time together. we would always talk about our future together and we loved to plan things like what our future house would look like, things we‚Äôd do when we‚Äôd be married; and she always seemed so adamant and excited to be with me. i recognize how stupid it was to jeopardise our relationship for so long especially considering how important she is to me and i don‚Äôt think ill ever live down those regrets. what im trying to say is that i feel awful about everything that i did, or didnt do. and i completely understand why she felt like she had to end everything. but i feel like what we had is worth working on to try and make it work again.
       it‚Äôs super easy for me to say that, and selfish considering i was the problem, and everything that followed was the consequence of my actions. it‚Äôs just so hard for me to move on because i really felt like we were meant for eachother, and im confident she felt that way too. what im trying to say is that i want to work on myself so that i can get to a point where maybe we could start again. i‚Äôve started talking to a therapist about communicating my feelings better, and started journaling to reflect on my emotions and thoughts so that i can try to understand everything better. and i know it‚Äôs so selfish of me to want her back, and maybe that just isn‚Äôt possible. 
      an update since originally writing this:
i reached out about a week after we broke up and we talked a bit about checking in on one another. she even mentioned that she missed our friendship a lot. our conversation finished w her telling me that it was difficult for her to talk right now and that she‚Äôd try reaching out again soon.
     it‚Äôs been about a month and we haven‚Äôt spoken to one another, i‚Äôve done a ton of reflection and created a growth timeline for myself. it‚Äôs so hard not to reach out again but that feels like im invading boundaries. she seems happy right now, granted i don‚Äôt really know that.

Should I reach out again soon? I want more than anything to start over and treat her the way she should‚Äôve always been treated, I also keep telling myself that we will get back together (mainly because of just how devoted we were to eachother) but in the event that that‚Äôs just not possible, I want to move on, and know that for certain.",millionththrowaway21,1760392538.0,2,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o5xjr1/is_is_too_soon_to_reach_out/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o5xjr1/is_is_too_soon_to_reach_out/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False

1o5xbed,Why is it happening like this?,"

I'm honestly not ready to move on. My ex is older than me, there's a six-year difference between us. We weren't together for a long time, but before that, we were best friends. We had such a strong, almost inseparable bond.

He saw me as a little sister and taught me so much. I admire so many things about him ‚Äî his incredible general knowledge, the way he speaks, and so many other things I probably couldn‚Äôt even list. The truth is, I think I‚Äôve become a little obsessed.

I even dress like him. I've developed the same interests and passions as him. It's like a part of me is still holding on to who we were, or maybe who I was when I was with him.

I feel like I idealized him too much, even though I know what he did was really wrong ‚Äî and even now, I'm still dealing with post-traumatic stress.

1o5x3n1,"I (28M) am till deeply in love with my ex (27F), can't let go","My ex(27f) and I(28m) were together for 2 years. I think we had a great relationship overall, it was full of love although we fought occasionally. One year ago, she said she was not getting enough attention from me during a career-related delicate period. I got a little defensive and things escalated. In the end, she told me to fuck off and kicked me out of her house.

It hurt me. I think she was right in what she said, and everybody is entitled to their feelings. But, the way she brought it up and what happened afterwards.

After the breakup, she kept sending signals through a mutual friend for like a week, asking me to reach out and make things right. I didn't. I don't know whether it was hurt or ego, I didn't. I know she wanted to get back together and she waited, but I didn't make a move. I kept caring about her deeply, but I didn't make a move. I assumed we would get back together anyways, because it had happened before. There were so many moments where I wanted to tell her I wanted to get back together and I still loved her, but I didn't. It's now become the biggest regret of my life so far. My ego overrode my love for her.

It turns out seven months after the breakup, she downloaded Hinge, a dating app. Found someone on it. And now they have been dating for six months. I only found out two months ago. My heart's been on fire since I found out. I went berserk. I am burning with love. I love her madly.

Love, regret, despair. I feel it all. I have been rewinding all past mistakes. I have been reliving all the moments in which I did not do enough. I know she is the one. I know she was the one. Not treating the love of my life right haunts me.

I wrote her a letter when I found out. Admitting my mistakes, explained how madly I'm in love with her. That I carried her in my heart all this time but my ego won. She replied with a letter saying I hurt her so much, abandoned her at a crucial time. That she still copes with that feeling, and an apology now is useless except for my own conscience. That she moved on and wants to protect her new life.

I couldn't. I couldn't let go. I just couldn't. I know that she loves me deep inside. I know that she is setting up all these walls to . Our mutual friend has talked to her recently. She cried for two mins straight, saying ""he would go back to his old ways if we came back together"". Saying I wouldn't be happy with her because she would always be mad at me.

How to deal with this? I can't date or function properly honestly. I decided to rebuild myself in the meantime. I had problems with my parents fixed that. Started hitting the gym. Become a better person overall because I have been questioning myself all the time. I am growing. I want to show that I am growing. I am trying not to hope, but I have to admit I am hoping. Hope keeps me alive. I am hoping that her relationship would end, and we would get back together. I don't think I will experience love ever again in its purest form like I did with her. What we had was the most special thing for both of us, and ours was her first serious relationship. We are having some friendly interactions like once or twice a week because we are part of the same circle. I am trying to respect her boundaries while at the same time showing that I still care.

1o5w8fz,So lost and need some brutal honesty,"
Need some brutal honesty please

I‚Äôve (36F) been with my boyfriend (38M) for almost 3 years now. We first met years ago, lost touch, and then reconnected later. We lived in different countries at first and met years ago when he was visiting my country. He‚Äôs very avoidant, and I know a lot of it comes from trauma from his childhood. I try to understand that and have been patient, but I also know it‚Äôs not an excuse for how badly he treats me now.

The first 2 years were honestly amazing. There were a few red flags I ignored, but overall he was kind, caring, and supportive. I trusted him completely. I could talk to him about anything, and he actually listened. We would stay up all night talking and laughing. He was so in love with me and i could not believe how lucky i was. He would tell me nice things constantly, reassure me, tell me how much he loved me, that he could not wait for life with me. We flew to see each often and eventually I gave up everything, my job, my home, my country, to move in with him. I know people say you shouldn‚Äôt do that for a man, but at the time it felt worth it. I believed he was my person, and that we‚Äôd build the best life together.

We‚Äôve now lived together for two years. He has kids who are with us 50% of the time, and I love them to death.

But about a year ago, it was like a switch flipped. Everything was great until it wasn‚Äôt. It feels like he just woke up one day and hated me. It went from being this wonderful life with the man of my dreams but then one day it was just different and i dont understand why. Since then, I‚Äôve been fighting for this relationship, and I‚Äôm exhausted, mentally, emotionally, and physically.

He isn‚Äôt supportive anymore. If I try to talk about anything serious, whether it‚Äôs about us or something personal (like how much I miss home or me feeling down about things), he shuts down. He snaps at me for the smallest things, like chewing too loud (he once told me to go eat upstairs alone because crackers were ‚Äútoo loud‚Äù), or for getting overexcited about little things I enjoy (like when I saw a shooting star and he shushed me and told me i was being too excited). 

He puts no effort into birthdays or anniversaries and gives me zero reassurance, no matter how much I ask for it. He knows I love small gestures like flowers, but I‚Äôve never gotten that from him. Meanwhile, I try to do those things for him. For example, I made him a photo album of our first year living together with a handwritten letter inside. That was over a year ago, and to this day he still hasn‚Äôt opened it, not looked at the photos nor read the letter i wrote. When I asked, he said he just ‚Äúforgets.‚Äù

He constantly tells me he ‚Äúneeds space.‚Äù I‚Äôve tried to give it to him, even though I live in a country where I have no friends, family, or job. I have not been able to find a job in my field because i dont speak the language here but when i do go home to visit my family i want to be able pick up some work. I have a masters degree and i hate that i cant use it here, i have tried learning the language on my own a bit, so my long term plan was always to get into my field again. He is financially very well set and has been very generous when it comes to that aspect so that has helped me with adjusting to a new life at my age away from all i know and go home to my country to visit when i want. 

I leave the house just to give him room, even when I have nowhere else to go. I have even gone that far to just sit in my car for hours in random parking lots just to give him space. He tells me our problems stem from him not getting enough space and alone time but living with someone alway means sacrificing some space. I offer to stay in one room to let him have the house to him self but he says that is not enough because he hears me flush the toilet for example and that interrupts him because he just wants silence. 

I do most the chores, the cooking, and everything I can to meet his needs, but I get nothing in return. When I go home to my own country (which he often encourages me to do, so he gets ‚Äúspace‚Äù), he barely contacts me, never calls or messages. He never checks in on me, how im doing for example. Even on my birthday this summer when i was visiting my home country, he called me once in the morning and then ignored my messages for the rest of the day, even the goodnight message I sent. This happens often, he reads my messages but doesn‚Äôt respond for hours and hours. I dont message him a lot because of this reason but sometimes i do have to but then i have to wait for 4-6 for a reply. 
In the beginning he tried to have a relationship with my family, he loved them and they loved him. We had group chats and he used to be active there wanting to get to know them but then he just stopped, stopped replying to them and said he was too busy when i reminded him. 

With his kids, I‚Äôve poured myself into building a relationship. But I never feel like it‚Äôs enough. He criticizes me and says I‚Äôm not doing enough to bond with them, yet he excludes me from things when it‚Äôs just the three of them, which makes me feel like an outsider. As an example he takes them to his home country to visit his family but im not invited with them. He has no problem leaving me all alone in the house for days when he takes them to see family (reminder we live in another country so i have no one around to see or spend time with), he does not care if im here by myself and feeling depressed, when he is away he doesnt even message to check on me. He says he wants to be able to take the kids on his own and that i dont need to come with all the time and having me around is stressful and the bed at his parents is not comfy when two people sleep in it. A bunch of excuses basically and when writing this down i feel so stupid to allow this to happen.

It‚Äôs so hard because I‚Äôve been carrying all of this alone. I don‚Äôt want to tell my family because I know they‚Äôd worry, so for the past year I‚Äôve bottled everything inside. He‚Äôs so nice to everyone else, so polite, so loved, such a good father. I just don‚Äôt understand why he can‚Äôt be that way with me.

I think I know what I need to do. I know this has to be emotional abuse to some level right? It feels obvious. But maybe I just need some perspective. Maybe I just need words of encouragement to finally take the step and leave. I need someone to tell me that im a little insane for letting myself be treated this way. Starting over at 36 is terrifying, and even with everything, the thought of leaving him and never seeing him again breaks my heart because i love him so much that it hurts. I‚Äôve never felt this lost in my life.

Tl;dr: I (36F) gave up everything to move for my boyfriend (38M). A year ago he flipped a switch and now treats me like he hates me.

1o5vmp8,Any thoughts that can help me make sense of why I‚Äôm feeling guilty?,"
4 days ago I left my bf of 2 years because i felt i had no choice.
We share the same social circle so I need help from strangers in here with going through all this.

Background:
2 weeks ago i was on holidays with my bf for something he had to do and agreed to spend my bday there.

I felt ill but dragged myself to his event; at 5.30 am on my bday he came home very drunk and snapped at me, shouting and insulting me over something stupid.

At that moment i decided to go back home as I felt very disrespected, following several months during which I felt coming second to every party or any other thing (It was a longish time of me being burnout by working a lot, and he not understanding i needed quality time)

After this holiday he got upset that i had not called him and he believed some gossips, at which point i felt the only thing i could do was breaking up with him. 
I left him on Wednesday.

I have feelings but the way this relationship has been for months makes me suffer and I think if I stayed nothing would ever change (then I feel guilty for thinking it, for some reasons)
Everything had become too unbalanced on his side and these are not things one solves with words.


Our relationship was not like this until 6 months ago and now i feel just stupid having put so much efforts for 2 years to just feel like this.

I have difficulties putting together the person I knew for 1.5 years and the one of the last 6-8 months.
 they are the same person but feels like two completely different men.

1) I told him I was exhausted at traveling every single Friday to his place to stay there until Monday early morning (I work on Mondays whereas he‚Äôs off) whilst traveling back and forth within the weekend to care for my pet. I said that this was too unbalanced. He agreed with it, but did not really step up in a consistent way (eg going to my place. We leave 40 minutes by public transport). He did it 3-4 times in those months
2) i was burnout by working a lot and sometimes too exhausted going out on fri/Sat night until 3 am. But during those months it often (not always) meant I went back home (mine) by myself because he always needed to stay until closing time, or go to another pub afterwards (eg pubs that stay open until 3 or 4 am)
3) he found out some supplement that takes hangover away and this is when it became unhinged as he started drinking more and sometimes going out 5-6 nights a week. 
4) last time we spent quality time not involving chaos (eg going out just for the sake of it) was in June. 
5) any event, gig - anything- could never be missed even if they were random things. I therefore started feeling more and more relegated into doing his things, or nothing at all. 

I knew he was/is stressed etc and I did say I wanted to spend more real time together, but as I am not a b*ll breaker I never did so angry or complaining or shouting- maybe that‚Äôs why he dis not hear me.

Prior to that time, we had a normal life going out but also doing normal things or spending REAL time together.

During the whole relationship he was always nice to me, called me almost every day etc my issue is that whilst I know nothing came from bad intentions, the episode on my bday made the whole context very heavy and i needed some time to reset.
He knew i was very overwhelmed and upset which is why i left the holiday, but apparently he could only see the effects on himself (abandonment) during those days.

1o5vllb,I need some help,"Me (M23) and my ex A (F20) broke up 6-7 months ago. This was a long-distance relationship; I am from Connecticut, and she has moved from Vegas to New York. I thought I was starting to heal, but two days ago, she messaged me out of the blue saying she wanted to try again.

At first, I held back, knowing all the red flags were still present and that I‚Äôd be compromising my self-respect to let things slide again. But within 24 hours, I realized the painful truth: I still love her deeply. I was ready to ignore the toxicity and do anything to 
be with her, even if it was degrading.

Then, just as quickly as she appeared, she flipped the script. Last night, she ended things and said she was done trying to re-talk. This immediately made me fight for her. I suggested meeting in person to talk face-to-face and get a definitive answer.

This morning, I was blocked. Her final message was that this is her closure, and she‚Äôs done.

I am completely lost because this directly contradicts what she‚Äôs told me before. She previously said things like she wishes I would have surprised her in person during the time we were apart to show that I would go that extra mile to fight for her. It felt like she was sending mixed signals that I should have done something grand to win her back. Now that I‚Äôm trying, I‚Äôm blocked.

I feel like my entire life has been taken away again, and I cannot handle another six months of being alone and hurting.

My Request to the Community

I talked to people, I understand she is bad for me, and I know I can do better. But I don't want to. The love is there, and it won't die.

I need practical advice on one thing: How do I completely eliminate this part of my mind that needs her? I want a way to stop the feeling of needing her and break the emotional bond.

I am a homebody and don't like going out or partying. I need ways I can get over her from home without waiting, because waiting six months didn't work. I just want to know how I can kill this feeling for good so I can move on.

Please do not tell me ""she treated you wrong"" or ""you can do better."" I know that. I need to know how to stop loving her despite knowing it.

TL;DR: Ex who is long distance reached out wanting to try again, I realized I still love her despite her toxicity, she blocked me 24 hours later. She previously hinted she wanted me to fight for her via a surprise visit, and I am confused and heartbroken. I need ways to kill the attachment/love I have for her without having to go out and ""live it up."" How do I move on as a homebody?",ItsMorensauce,1760388100.0,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o5vllb/i_need_some_help/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o5vllb/i_need_some_help/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o5vbuy,Stop Being available,"Writing this to release.

I had a messy on and off situation with my ex that started in early 2023 and ended later that year. We dated for about eight months, after she pursued me twice after meeting me at a mutual friend‚Äôs party. I was upfront on our first date‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt date for fun or casually‚Ä¶ and because she pursued me, I thought she was serious.

She had her own friends but slowly became part of my friend group too, so when we broke up, I kept running into her. She kept inviting my circle of friends to things, even after I asked her to stop for a while because I needed no contact.

We broke up because she started talking about wanting to ‚Äúexplore‚Äù and had become emotionally cold. I found myself feeling clingy and needy‚Ä¶ which had never happened in any of my previous relationships. I was looking for something stable.

She, on the other hand, kept close friendships with flings and exes, and was sleeping around at a rate that made me uncomfortable‚Ä¶ even with people she worked with. I met two of them later, which was awkward to say the least. She also started talking about wanting open relationships in the future, sounding completely unsure of what she wanted. The anxiety got so bad it gave me shoulder and neck pain.

One day, about eight months in, we were having a casual chat at her place and I just blurted out that I wasn‚Äôt happy and that we needed to be single. I could tell she was never going to admit what I‚Äôd been feeling all along. I asked her why she hadn‚Äôt told me she wanted an open relationship in the beginning, and she said, ‚ÄúI agreed to monogamy because I didn‚Äôt want to lose you.‚Äù I felt tricked. So I told her to go explore‚Ä¶ that she was free‚Ä¶ and I cut all contact.

Example 1

Moments in that relationship made me feel unwanted, not enough, or not someone to care for. One example: she invited me to a party that one of her ex-flings was at, and she ended up flirting with that person in front of me. I‚Äôm not confrontational, so I swallowed my pride and pretended it didn‚Äôt bother me. She apologised later, but that one stuck with me for a long time.

She wanted to be friends almost immediately after the breakup. I told her no‚Ä¶ that I needed no contact to heal‚Ä¶ but she didn‚Äôt get it. She kept inviting me (and my friends) to things, and I kept trying to be nice and take the high road.

A few times she invited me out, just the two of us, and she‚Äôd get touchy and flirty. The hopeful part of me‚Ä¶ the sad and lonely part‚Ä¶ was open to it. That led to us sleeping together twice.

During that time, she was also telling me about booking flights to visit her ex-girlfriend (someone she‚Äôd slept with right after our breakup) and even confessed she felt she‚Äôd ‚Äúused‚Äù that ex.

Example 2

In summer 2024, she invited me to her birthday party. By that point, I had started seeing someone I really liked and had begun to move on. We weren‚Äôt in much contact anymore‚Ä¶ just random texts‚Ä¶ but I asked her weeks before the party if she was seeing anyone or if anyone she was dating would be there. I wanted to decide if it was even a good idea to go and emotionally prepare myself.

She said no. Then, just a few hours before the party, she suddenly mentioned that someone she was dating would, in fact, be there. I told her that her communication was awful, and she said she had only decided a few days ago that this person should come.

At that point, I was frustrated, so I said fine‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll bring someone too. And I did. I even checked with my friends first, asking if I was overreacting, and they told me, ‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶ bring the person you‚Äôre dating, we want to meet her.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt want her to see me as desperate or like I was just hanging around. I wanted to protect my self-respect. It turned out to be a good party‚Ä¶ I was happy with the person I brought, and honestly happy for her too. Her new girlfriend seemed nice. But she kept giving me these looks‚Ä¶ letting hugs linger a bit too long. Nothing happened, but the energy was confusing.

Now it‚Äôs 2025. Months go by. My relationship ends‚Ä¶ and so does hers with the woman from her birthday. She starts reaching out again.

She tried to meet a few times, but I couldn‚Äôt because I was dealing with my own breakup. That relationship had its own chaos‚Ä¶ a story for another time. I was exhausted and just trying not to drown.

Eventually, we met for drinks. I was foggy‚Ä¶ not really present‚Ä¶ and we talked about our breakups. She apologised for how things ended between us, saying she now understood how it felt to be with someone who wants to be ‚Äúopen and free.‚Äù She mentioned she was dating men at the moment and wanted to ‚Äújust marry one.‚Äù The conversation was short. She was a bit touchy. We wished each other well and left.

Example 3

A few weeks later, she texted inviting me to her housewarming party. The same pattern played out. Beforehand she‚Äôd been flirty over text, and I let myself flirt back. Again, I asked if she was seeing anyone or if anyone she was involved with would be there. She said no.

I showed up‚Ä¶ and later that night, I walked in on her half-undressed with someone else.

The next day, I sent texts that I‚Äôm embarrassed by now‚Ä¶ too emotional, mostly saying I was hurt by her behaviour and that she was terrible at communicating. She replied with, ‚ÄúI had wanted to hook up with you but didn‚Äôt want to complicate things since we‚Äôd both just come out of relationships.‚Äù

That just showed me, again, how little awareness or care she had for me. Because I‚Äôd never do that to her. This was March of this year.

Since then, I‚Äôve been done. She‚Äôs texted me a few times‚Ä¶ starting with a birthday message around May, which I replied to but never read her response. As of today, six of her texts are left unread.

I‚Äôm indifferent. I feel nothing.

The last one starts with ‚ÄúHope you‚Äôre doing ok and sending good vibes wherever you are, and apologies once agai‚Ä¶‚Äù but I never opened it. I couldn‚Äôt be bothered. When it came through, I just felt‚Ä¶ nothing.

I‚Äôm busy with my own life now, and I‚Äôm happier. I barely think of her. Seeing that message just made me reflect on how far I‚Äôve come, and I wanted to get it out of my system.

If I could block her, I would. After my last relationship and everything that came with it, I‚Äôve decided I‚Äôm cutting off all communication with exes. It‚Äôs not healthy for me.

I have a good life and good friends. Keeping exes around is just a temporary fix for a much bigger issue‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôve realised I‚Äôve let people walk over me. I‚Äôve stayed friends with people just to seem ‚Äúcool and collected.‚Äù I‚Äôve forced forgiveness when I was deeply hurt‚Ä¶ turned the other cheek‚Ä¶ but at whose expense?

I‚Äôve turned 30 now, and I can‚Äôt keep living without self-respect.

I used to want to be the mature ex who keeps the peace‚Ä¶ but honestly? The peace only came when I stopped trying to be the bigger person. I don‚Äôt need closure. I don‚Äôt need answers. I don‚Äôt need hope. And I definitely don‚Äôt need anyone disturbing my peace.

Basically: stop being available to an ex who uses you when it suits them. They are not your friend. You validate them somehow and allow them to give you the bare minimum. They weren‚Äôt honest when you were together‚Ä¶ they took you for granted‚Ä¶ so don‚Äôt expect a great friendship now.

And just to be clear: she doesn‚Äôt owe me a relationship or anything. We ended a while ago. The feelings I‚Äôve felt are my own, and I take responsibility for them. This isn‚Äôt to say she did something wrong‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs to say that I failed to put myself first. I stayed emotionally available when I should have stepped away. That‚Äôs on me, and I‚Äôve learned from it.

1o5v557,my ex just texted me out of the blue again,"essentially what the title says. it‚Äôs been 2,5 months after he (m33) broke up with me (f29) because ‚Äûsomething was missing‚Äú. 

after the break up i stalked his spotify (i know i know‚Ä¶) for a long time and a few weeks ago i noticed he started listening to ‚Äûour‚Äú music again. two artists which meant a lot to us both and he stopped listening to them for weeks after the break up. so when i saw that i kinda assumed that he thought about me again. 

yesterday i received and email from him, saying that he knows that this message is probsbly not the best for me and that it‚Äôs quite selfish to send it. he essentially repeated what he said when he broke up with me. that he appreciates me, the time we spent together, that he loved being around me but it wasn‚Äôt right for him. 

i was on my way to come to terms with the break up. it started getting easier for me. i stopped trying to make sense of it and just accept it. and then he writes me a fucking email‚Ä¶ the wounds that began healing are torn open again. and for what?? he sent that message to ease HIS mind. he didn‚Äôt even care how that might affect me. he knew it wouldn‚Äôt be the best for me and did it anyway. now i‚Äôm back to ground zero, having hopes again, even though he clearly just messaged to get some kind of closure for himself. but this little damned spark of hope is back and i‚Äôm so mad at him for it. 

i know, the progress is not gone and healing isn‚Äôt linear. but this fucking makes me mad. and now he‚Äôs not even responding to my message. i know it‚Äôs for the best. but my irrational mind loves playing tricks on me. just because he felt the need to reach out. i didn‚Äôt need to hear how sorry he was again. there was nothing new for me in the text. so my brain is fucked for no good reason at all.

1o5v0ei,Found him on dating apps 3 weeks after breakup,"He said he's not ready for a relationship anytime soon. Said he doesn't have the headspace right now to sleep with other girls and I just don't know him that well if that's the case. 

That if there's a chance in the future he will definitely get closer back to me, but right now there's nothing he can do I deserve better and should find better and I'm beautiful inside and out.

1o5uw5c,Need help after betraying her. ( women advice needed),"Hi everyone. 
I need help and advice , a lot of people will criticise this post but I‚Äôve taken Everthing on the chin so far

Me and my girlfriend were together for 3 years, an absolute perfect relationship, she was perfect everything about her was perfect. I went on a lads holiday for 7 nights. The first 6 nights of me being there I hadn‚Äôt looked at another girl and didn‚Äôt want to either. On the last night I did something stupid and got another girl. As soon as I got back home I picked her up and told her the truth. I absolutely destroyed that girl and I hate myself everyday for ruining something so real between us. I‚Äôm 21 years old and I do have my shit together when I say this was a genuine mistake I really mean that. After I owned up to what I had done she was destroyed inside. Our love was real , she knows it and I know it too. I was so full of guilt after that every time she broke down about how much she loved me and how could I do this I didn‚Äôt even know what to say. After 2 weeks she had her girls holiday and she got with another guy and the night after she got with him again and stayed in his hotel. This was pure karma and she had every right to do that because we weren‚Äôt together at the time but it absolutely destroyed me as a man and I still feel it to this day. When she came home we met a few times and said what we had to say. We genuinely both still love each other so much, every time she texts me she breaks down saying how much she loves me and I do the same thing, but the day after she throws up all these walls to protect herself saying she needs time to heal and she needs space or whatever. She reached out a few times like being hot and cold and it has my brain absolutely fucked. 2 weeks ago she decided to go no contact and her snap score has been rising 1000+ a day, I might be crazy for checking that Ino, but it‚Äôs just really fucking hard when I love her so much. She hasn‚Äôt taken any off my posts down. This weekend she sent me a random TikTok saying ‚Äúmeeting up with your ex after the breakup and you realize hes the only one who really knows you and can comfort and calm you down :/‚Äú

Ino she loves me but shes so conflicted at the minute and i feel like her friends around her are more interested in her being single than actually trying for a second chance. 

2 days before we went no contact I reached out to her dad ( which I hadn‚Äôt spoken a word to since we broke up 3 months ago) and said could we meet for a chat. He invited me to his house and I said I‚Äôm sorry I couldn‚Äôt come to you sooner but I had to learn to forgive myself before expecting forgiveness off someone else. We were talking for 2.5 hours. He cried , I cried and he said he doesn‚Äôt look at me any different and that it was a big mistake and that he would never look at us differently for trying again. The next day my ex came home from college and he spoke to her and said I think you should give him another chance. 

For the people reading, (if anyone hasüòÇ) , our love was genuinely so real, every day was laughter and our connection was so perfect. I jsut need some advice on what‚Äôs going on through her head and what I should be doing to get her back. I appreciate everyone who comments on this post if it‚Äôs good or bad. 

Ino I fucked up but I really did try to fix it. Thanks 

Jsut to add. It‚Äôs been 3 months. She‚Äôs liking my posts and story‚Äôs. Sleeps with my teddys. Has all the pictures of us still in her room. Ino I cheated on her and I hate what I done. But I‚Äôm

1o5utqt,I miss her.,"It's been 3 weeks since my ex ldr girlfriend (F26) and I (M20) broke up.  
We broke up on good terms, we basically didn't want to break up, she said so herself yet we hurt each other. For that, a little context about us.  
She's a surgeon from Japan, so she was quite busy and stressed. She also had trauma so she had problems video calling and calling. In our 4 and a half months together, I've never seen her on video call nor heard her on a call (Asked her to just say ""hello"" on a call but she said it was too much, tho I think she called her boss before? I hope I ain't miss remembering that part). Which sounds like a lot but I just really like her, and she was kind to me, she liked me. She choose me. I also had my fair share of problems (Some things I just noticed while writing this how bad I was). But I did see a few pictures and she sent me a few voice messages, tho they were short. So I heard her voice and saw her even if she wasn't very comfy with any of it. For my side of that, I did call with her when she was muted I talked, and when we were on our phones, I had my camera on too so she could see me. (Another bad thing from my side was just getting bored easily of stuff like games in general but espeailly things she liked that countered mine cause she didn't talk to me, think I would have actually enjoyed those times if she was able to talk and joke around with me. Just smth that I messed up again.)  
She's more avoidant cause of all she went through and I'm anxious attachment. I need reassurance and closeness. While she needed time and patience. I hate that I couldn't give that to her while she was really trying for me.  She even said she'd quit her job for me, went as far as to try out for a new one. She also always said gm and gn, even when we were fighting and such. She never missed a day.

That's why I hate this. I always wanted a girlfriend and she loved me and choose me. But I feel like I ruined it. I know we weren't perfect but I feel like I should have kept trying. When we broke up she said she thinks we should break up and I just went along with it, without really fighting for us.

I really wanna send her a text now, telling her how much I miss her and that I want her back. To show her I understand more now.  
I know my impatience made things hard on her. I wanted to be closer to her and to show her love, yet all I did was stress and overwhelm her even more by talking about the future: calls, visits, plans about us living together and just what the future could look like. I tend to overthink and that's where this came from. I know it was wrong of me but I didn't have bad intention but looking back on it, seems way too rushed and I just now while typing this realized just how badly I fucked up that part...

We both had problems and we aren't a great match but  want to believe in love. Like in the notebook. Keep trying and never give up. Yet I'm scared that I would hurt her if I sent her a text. Idk what she feels at the moment but I want what's best for her. And I also aren't sure how things would go if we got back together. I see things where I should improve, my patience mostly and just giving her more time to just relax and all but there's no guarantees.

I'm scared to hurt her and Idk what to do. Is it too late? Is it for the best to let her go? To move on and let her go on and live her life. I'm also scared I want her back just cause I'm lonely so Idk. (Hang out with friends plenty but just not the same with friends)  
I'd love to hear what you guys think, pointing out my mistakes is also appreciated, my friends usually just say I deserve better or will meet someone else which doesn't help too much at this point. Thanks guys.

1o5ue7o,Me and my girlfriend broke up because she wanted to go to frat parties and clubbing.,"We realized we were incompatible, personally I don't think people in relationships should go to clubs/frats unless they're going together with their significant other, that's just my personal opinion. I always assumed that's how everyone felt. My girlfriend made me realize that's not true, there's couples out there that do go to clubs without their significant other and they're both comfortable with it. 

I just wanted to ask the people out here if I'm wrong about my opinion? Am I ever going to find someone that thinks the same way I do about this situation? or is everyone just okay with going to clubs and getting drunk without their partner now?

Are there women out there want to be with a man that doesn't go clubbing because he's in a relationship and that reciprocate the same?

1o5ud5q,It‚Äôs been a month of no contact‚Ä¶ here‚Äôs how I feel about it.,"Hi!

A little over a month ago, I wrote here about my situation with my ex who ended our 7-year relationship because she ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt know what she wanted or felt.‚Äù
In that post, I received comments that honestly helped me a lot, and that‚Äôs why I wanted to write an update ‚Äî because expressing myself and reading advice or similar stories really helped me heal a bit.

How am I doing now?
I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm okay. I‚Äôve been in therapy for 4 months, and it‚Äôs helped me improve and accept what happened ‚Äî to accept that even though there wasn‚Äôt a real reason for the breakup (no fight, no argument, no cheating, nothing bad), constantly trying to find an explanation was actually stopping me from accepting it fully.
It was even harder because she once said, ‚ÄúI know life will bring us together again,‚Äù and I took those words as a promise.

It‚Äôs been a month since we last talked, and I was always the one who initiated contact. She hasn‚Äôt reached out once during this time ‚Äî and that hurts. It makes me imagine a lot of things, feel a lot of things, and realize others.
I still struggle not to check her social media. I don‚Äôt follow her anymore on Instagram (she has a private account), but I still see her profile picture because we had a shared ‚Äúsaved posts‚Äù group, and it pops up whenever I save something.
On TikTok, since we still follow each other, I sometimes see what she shares.
And I know those little ‚Äúwindows‚Äù that show me what she‚Äôs up to aren‚Äôt healthy for me, especially because, if I‚Äôm being honest, during this process I‚Äôve also posted song lyrics or things that hint at missing someone.

But one day she shared something silly like, ‚ÄúSince I didn‚Äôt get yellow flowers, my Halloween costume will be shorter.‚Äù (In Latin America, there‚Äôs a day where you give yellow flowers to your girlfriend or someone you like.)
And I don‚Äôt even know why that bothered me so much. My mind went, ‚ÄúIs this how you‚Äôre working on yourself? Is this your healing?‚Äù
While I was here, thinking of ways to talk to her again, focusing on self-improvement ‚Äî and that‚Äôs what she‚Äôs posting?
When that feeling passed, I felt bad for letting it affect me so much.
Because she‚Äôs free to live and do whatever she wants.
But then I saw her profile picture again‚Ä¶ and it broke me a little. The only thing I could feel was: I miss you.

I miss the memories, I miss the feeling of being next to her, I miss her family and the sense of belonging that came with them.
It seems like her life is moving on ‚Äî and I‚Äôm genuinely happy for her ‚Äî but I feel stuck.
Even though I‚Äôve done things to move forward: going to therapy, climbing volcanoes, going to the movies alone or with friends, pushing myself at work, and learning to cook‚Ä¶ I realize I did a lot of those things still thinking about her.
Maybe part of it was self-motivation, but another part was hoping she‚Äôd notice or react somehow.
(Climbing that volcano was actually my last ‚Äúexcuse‚Äù to text her ‚Äî I sent her a photo of the sunrise from the top, saying I dedicated it to her because she loves sunrises.)

According to my therapist, I‚Äôm in the depression stage.
I‚Äôm not sure, but sometimes memories hit me hard.
When a friend talks about future plans with their partner or shares something sweet, I still picture her. I miss her a lot.
I‚Äôve thought many times about sending her something simple like:
‚ÄúHey, you don‚Äôt have to reply. I just hope you‚Äôre doing well. I miss you.‚Äù
But then I reread it and ask myself: What do you really expect to get from this?
She already knows you miss her.
The last time you talked, she stopped replying ‚Äî and she hasn‚Äôt reached out in a month.
So instead, I just write those messages for myself and keep going.

Sorry if my thoughts are a bit messy and this turned out long, but I don‚Äôt have many friends I can open up to.
Writing here last time really helped me, and so did reading all your comments, so that‚Äôs why I wanted to write this update.

I‚Äôm still working on myself.
I still have setbacks sometimes.
I still get sad, but I‚Äôve learned those moments are temporary ‚Äî and they make me appreciate the days when I feel genuinely okay.
Even though I can‚Äôt always talk about this with my friends, I know I‚Äôm not alone because they‚Äôve shown me they‚Äôre here for me.
And honestly, that‚Äôs meant a lot and helped me more than they probably realize.",Ch4rls09,1760385427.0,17,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o5ud5q/its_been_a_month_of_no_contact_heres_how_i_feel/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o5ud5q/its_been_a_month_of_no_contact_heres_how_i_feel/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o5ud4n,"He broke up with me over text, then rewrote the story to make it my fault","I 23F just got out of a relationship with my ex 24M. I‚Äôm still trying to make sense of it, so I‚Äôm putting it here because I know some of you will understand.

Throughout the relationship, I was the communicator. If something felt off, I‚Äôd try to talk it out calmly. Every time I brought up my feelings, he‚Äôd either get defensive (‚ÄúHow am I flipping?‚Äù), dismissive (‚ÄúSorry if my words aren‚Äôt to your liking‚Äù), or guilt-trip me (‚ÄúI guess I‚Äôm just a burden‚Äù). When things got uncomfortable, he‚Äôd shut down completely with ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not doing this right now‚Äù or ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre gonna drop it.‚Äù

I always stayed patient, validated him, and apologized when I was wrong. But it started to feel like I was walking on eggshells, trying to keep the peace while he got to decide when the conversation ended.

Then last week, he broke up with me ‚Äî over text ‚Äî while I was out with friends. His reason was that he needed to ‚Äúfocus on school, work, and basketball.‚Äù The next day, he rewrote the whole thing, claiming that he‚Äôd ‚Äúpleaded‚Äù to talk on Sunday and that I ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt give him the chance.‚Äù But when I looked back, he‚Äôd mentioned Sunday once. There was no pleading, no attempt to communicate ‚Äî just avoidance.

The next morning, I sent a final message. I told him this would be the last thing I said because clearly he didn‚Äôt have the decency to respond to my message from the day before. I explained that I‚Äôd always supported him and validated him, and that ending things by text ‚Äî and then blaming me ‚Äî wasn‚Äôt fair or honest. I didn‚Äôt insult him. I just told the truth.

He never replied. Instead, he blocked me on everything.

Now I‚Äôm sitting here feeling angry, heartbroken, and a little gaslit. It‚Äôs hard to accept that someone I cared so much about could twist the story and leave like that. And out of NOWHERE too. I keep wondering how someone who claimed to love me could treat me like a burden for simply wanting clarity and respect.

I guess I‚Äôm just posting because I need to get it off my chest and would love some advice.

Weeks later, around September 20, I stalked her and found out she got a new boyfriend since early september. I talked to her asking if that was the truth, I asked her respectfully but since she did not want to admit it, I gave my last goodbye to her and she said to me that she loves me and will love me forever, then blocked me.

That‚Äôs what makes it worse, I think. There‚Äôs no one to be mad at. Just this huge empty space where someone used to be.

I still wake up and check my phone expecting his ‚Äúgood morning‚Äù text. I still pause music halfway through a song because it reminds me of the drive to his house. His toothbrush is still in my bathroom drawer I can‚Äôt bring myself to throw it away, but seeing it there every day feels like pressing on a bruise.

Everyone keeps saying, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre young, you‚Äôll move on,‚Äù like that makes it easier. But he wasn‚Äôt just my boyfriend. He was my person during some of the most confusing years of my life. He knew all my little habits the way I hum when I‚Äôm anxious, the way I make my coffee too sweet, the way I go quiet when I‚Äôm sad.

Now I catch myself wanting to tell him something funny I saw, and I have to stop mid-sentence because there‚Äôs no one to send it to anymore.

1o5tted,Fresh out of a breakup. Need advice.,"I‚Äôm fresh out of a breakup. The truth is, I was a bad person. I used to often become suicidal which in turn scared her. This deteriorated her mental health. Plus both of us used to blow up fights into such massive problems we forgot what the original fight was about it. It always came down to me being selfish, being unable to be there for her when she was at her lowest.

Today, I became suicidal again and realized the pain I was putting her through. I realized that no human deserves to go through so much pain, especially considering how much she loved me. I‚Äôve let her down and I can never let go of the fact that I messed her up. I ruined her life. She was my everything. But I had to make a decision today and end it, for her. While she may have been the girl of my dreams, I surely wasn‚Äôt the man she deserved. And I can never get over that fact. Why was I so bad? I do think I gave it my all. I ALWAYS tried but in the end it wasn‚Äôt enough and she doesn‚Äôt deserve to be with someone like me - someone who makes her sad. Mind you, I‚Äôve done a lot of things for her. Given her grand gestures (gave her the best birthday of her life) but it was in the small things I failed, where I was unable to show how much I care. I don‚Äôt think anyone deserves to be with me and that‚Äôs fine but I genuinely hope she heals.

1o5thg4,Is it okay to invite my ex-gf to my grandma's funeral,"Hi guys,

Haven't posted here in a while - been 3 months since my relationship ended.

It was not mutual - she called it off for all the good reasons.

I've betrayed and hurt her during our 7 years relationship - it was all my fault. 

I'm still working on myself trying to get over some past trauma and overcome my depression - it's a long road but I'm getting there.

We've talked a bit over messages and more in-person in these past 3 months. Nothing that would lead to a reconciliation, just going over our issues and how we felt.

However, for the past month it's been radio silence. Except for a story she shared on Social Media that I saw (she hide those from me long time ago) but this one she let me see, it's been silence. She promised me we will meet again soon so I'm just hanging to that hope and don't wanna rush anything. 

Unfortunately my grandma just died. She's met my grandma and they got along well, however they weren't that close. I wasn't that close with her either but she's still my grandma.

Should I write to my ex-girlfriend and let her know of this event? I'm not doing it for myself or to try to have her feel bad or some other similar feeling or some sort of obligation. I just want her to know given she has met her too. I really don't know what to do.

What would you do in my situation?

Thank you guys.

1o5thap,"Long Distance breakup, reconnect down the line?","I (22M) met this girl a few months before moving away for work. We met right before we graduated college and it was awesome. We only dated for about four months, but it clicked fast ‚Äî met her family, spent a ton of time together, and I was honestly falling for her. Shoot, her parents even texted me asking me what I wanted for dinner and how I was doing.

About a month after I moved, she broke up with me. She said the connection wasn‚Äôt the same with the distance, and I get that. It wasn‚Äôt messy ‚Äî no bad blood ‚Äî just one of those ‚Äútiming sucks‚Äù situations. We both cried when the breakup happened and I know the relationship was important to her, even knowing the preexisting circumstances. She even said she‚Äôd leave the door open if our paths ever lined up again.

Since then, I‚Äôve been focusing on myself ‚Äî working out, journaling, eating clean, trying to build some structure in my new city. Some days are great, other days I still think about her a lot. I‚Äôve deleted our texts and try not to check her socials, though I‚Äôll slip up sometimes.

I‚Äôm not planning to reach out or anything, but I‚Äôd be lying if I said I didn‚Äôt still hope we cross paths again someday when life looks different. I have no interest in doing long distance with her again, but when there was no distance, everything was amazing and she was so open with me about everything. For now, I‚Äôm just trying to let go without completely closing the door. We have a lot of mutual friends and I imagine in the future I will be back in the city where we met but I don‚Äôt know when that will be. I also told her I have no interest in just being her friend, so no contact is where I‚Äôm at right now. I feel like if things ever were to align, it would need to be in a situation with no pressure on making it work. I don‚Äôt know.

If anyone‚Äôs been through something similar ‚Äî how did you move forward while still staying open to whatever happens down the line? Some days are better than others and I‚Äôve been doing better recently but sometimes I fall in to spirals and constantly think about her, thinking I made a mistake leaving.

1o5s2wz,Feeling sexual feels so wrong now,"Sorry if this is tmi but I‚Äôm wondering if I‚Äôm alone on this. It‚Äôs been two weeks since we‚Äôve broken up now, and I‚Äôm having a hard time sexually. I‚Äôve always been someone with a high sex drive, to be blunt, I am a horny woman. Being celibate for two weeks now has made this worse, but doing anything about it feels wrong. I am definitely not in any place mentally to be seeking someone to fill a sexual void, so I won‚Äôt be doing that. But even doing things to myself feels wrong. When we were together, I would think about him, so my brain still goes to him when I try doing things myself, which makes me sad and also feels so wrong.

1o5rza9,"It‚Äôs Been Three Months, and I Still Miss Them More Than I Expected","It‚Äôs been about three months since my breakup, and I honestly thought I‚Äôd be in a better place by now. We were together for almost four years  shared an apartment, a friend group, and so many routines that it still feels strange living without them.

At first, I was angry and hurt, but lately, it‚Äôs just been quiet sadness. I miss the small things  like how they‚Äôd text me good morning or how we‚Äôd cook dinner together on Sundays. I‚Äôve been trying to stay busy, reconnecting with friends, even picking up a new hobby, but every now and then it hits me out of nowhere.

1o5rw4o,I finally walked away from someone I couldn't let go,"I was in a relationship that started intensely and felt very real ‚Äî constant texting, deep conversations, and talk about a future together. Over time he became distant and emotionally unavailable, and I found myself carrying most of the effort. He eventually ended it, and three months later he started seeing someone else. Even after the breakup, we kept talking and meeting; it felt like neither of us could fully let go. He said he wanted to stay friends, but the boundaries were always blurred, and I kept hoping maybe he‚Äôd come back. Now, he seems to be putting in more effort with this new person and appears serious about her, which hurts because I wish he had tried that way with me. We finally met to talk things through -it was emotional, we cried and hugged, and he admitted he‚Äôd hurt me. I told him I couldn‚Äôt keep living in that half-space and we are not going to meet anymore.  Now there‚Äôs this strange mix of peace and grief. I want to move on, but part of me still misses him and struggles with the idea that I‚Äôll probably never know him again years down the line.

1o5rve1,My Ex wants me back and I'm finding it hard to get over things.,"My (27m) and my Ex (24f) were in a relationship for a year. I did a lot for this girl if I'm entirely honest. Before we even started dating I chased and chased this girl for months because I just thought there was something about her and to this day I still feel like theres something about this girl that I just can't get over.

When I was chasing her, she had a boyfriend and told me it would never happen and that ship had sailed, she blocked me. Then 2 months later (after breaking up with her ex) she messages me to go out and she sleeps with me. I was 100% a rebound that she wanted to use to get over her breakup. I kept asking tor her to go out with me and she blocked me again, Why? Because she got back with her ex.

Then a few months later she messages me to go out with her for drinks, which I do. Because I was curious. She sits me down in a bar and tells me everything I wanted to hear. That here I was, this amazing guy that she didn't give a chance and that she felt like an idiot and that she wanted to give us that chance now and properly date each other. So we did.

Me and my ex then dated for a year, we were in a relationship. It was honestly great and I did all these amazing things for her. I bought a big expensive hotel room for valentines day. I took her on amazing dates. I stayed in hospital with her until the early hours of the morning when she was sick. Everyone said that I was literally the best boyfriend and that I treated her like a queen. Which I did honestly really try to do.

But overtime, a pattern built up. When she would see her past flings and people she fucked on a night out at a bar. She would willingly go up to them and chat to them, stroke their arm. All while I was their in front of her. She literally gave another man a peck on the lips in front of me one night. Her bestfriend sent me a ,message saying that she tried to flirt with her housemate and that one night she pushed him on the chair and tried to sit on top of him, calling him cute. Every time she did these things I cried and told her that these actions hurt me, and she said sorry and that it wouldn't happen again... Until it happened again.

So one night I blew up. I had a big fight with her and I called her out on all the bullshit. She then started questioning me and asked if she REALLY did those things that I said she did...

I left house at 3am, she blocked me on everything 10 minutes later.

Three months have passed since we've broke up. I've been with other people since and she's been with other people since. But she unblocks me, and gets in contact with me. She tells me that she wants to get back together with me and that she took me for granted, that she loves me and knows that she fucked up. She told me that when she broke up with me and blocked me that she thought about me every day and tried her hardest to get over me but I was in the back of her head the entire time, that it felt like she saw me everywhere and nowhere at the same time.

  
Despite all the shit she had done, I have to be honest. I do love her, I will always love her. And I've visited her a few times since to talk and share nights together. But there are things I still just can't get over. I don't know if I can trust her, she really seems to be trying to change and I can see the effort that she's making. It's actually really nice seeing her put in the effort that I put in.

The bad bits... She has a colleague from work that she kissed multiple times since we were apart. This was a colleague of hers that I thought was my friend too. I invited him to my birthday while we were together. They kissed multiple times and he's been hanging around her friends too. When i told her that I wouldn't be comfortable with him being around in our lives anymore she said that he was her friend and that she couldn't just drop him. Typical.

Not only that, But her best friend is in a relationship with this man. This man, I've met him before but his bestfriend stayed over at her house and shared her bed. Kissing and doing all sorts. I DON'T WANT to see any of these people again in my life. I want all past experiences with other people behind us. I don't want them invited around to our house for parties etc 

I just don't get it, if she loves me then she'd surely sacrifice these people in her life for me? But then again, she could just be pulling the wool over my eyes again.

1o5rmx7,Any thoughts ?,"2 weeks ago i was on holidays with my bf for something he had to do and agreed to spend my bday there.

I was ill but dragged myself to his event; at 5.30 am on my bday he came home very drunk and snapped at me, shouting and insulting me over something stupid.


At that moment i decided to go back home as I felt very disrespected following several months during which I felt coming second to every party or any other thing. It was a longish time of me being burnout by working a lot and he not understanding i needed quality time.

After this holiday he got upset that i had not called him and believed some gossips, at which point i felt the only thing i could do was breaking up with him.
I left him last Wednesday.

Everything had become too unbalanced on his side and these are not things one solves with words.

I have feelings for him but I could not endure that loneliness.

Or relationship was not like this until 6 months ago and now i feel just stupid having put so much efforts for 2 years to just feel like this.

I have difficulties putting together the person I knew for 2 years and the one of the last 6-8 months and make sense they are the same person.

Very disappointed and let down.

1o5qrg7,Moving on advice (it‚Äôs long fyi),"
Hi so I‚Äôm 19F and my partner is 19M. 
So both of us became friends in senior high school in 2022 -I was a new kid- we were in different classes but we followed each other on Instagram (pretty common here if u r in the same school) 
And then I saw his story of some concert in November , and idk i just texted saying how rich and it was just a moment. I was into making new friends and socialising etc. 

2.5 months later after regular talking and google meets etc- I did all of this platonically but he grew feelings for me- he asked me out on text
I come from a strict family and I didn‚Äôt harbour any such feelings for him so I said no politely.
We still spoke after that- but there were ups and downs.
After a few months I started growing feelings for him coz he was a great friend and then I had feelinfs from all summer (may month) 
And then in June when school reopened, I told my friends about it etc and told that if he asks me out I‚Äôll say yes. And this particular info reached to him as well.
So we confessed on call, and then he asked me out. 
We started dating in June of 2023
Then in 2024 we graduated from school after our boards. 
Then we started long distance.
We are from different castes and we wanted to get married- I told him that it‚Äôs gonna be v hard for me to ask my parents  in the future coz they‚Äôre p strict abt all this and idk if I‚Äôll have enuf courage- and we had a lot for fights abt this.
After that it was college time so he went to another city for college and I stayed in the same city our school was in- where my parents and his parents were . 
He went to a college where hooking up is pretty common, partying and clubbing are things done every other day.
Now I‚Äôm not someone who parties v often or drinks, I don‚Äôt have a lot of guys friends eyther- the ones I was friends with- started liking me so I had to cut it off coz I was in a relationship (this was in school) 
Ih college I don‚Äôt have a lot of guy friends who r close 
- he on the other hand is v extroverted, parties a lot and drinks etc and has a lot of female friends who r very pretty and hot
So I got insecure overtime and had issues w him not updating me after parties, or over night sleepovers w opposite gender friends and we used to fight abt it a lot.
We did meet whenever he used to come back. 
He left in July for college, came back in October when I travelled for 3 hrs in a bus to go pick him up at the airport alone and then we came back, went on a date the next day and then he left after Diwali in a few days. After that he came in December- stayed for two months - we prolly met 10 times max idk
Then he left on 30th jan 2025. 
Then i remember having some fight w him a day before we broke up coz I felt uncomfortable at a club where I had gone w mutual friend alone- her guy friends were p touchy w me (not in a bad way but I wasn‚Äôt used to it) so I texted him abt it while I was there
And all he said was ‚Äòbeat them up‚Äô in a funny way so I was p mad.
(that day my parents were out of town so I could sneak out to go clubbing lol) 

I decided to leave from the club alone coz I was uncomf and I texted him and it sayinf I‚Äôm going back home and a guy was dropping me in an auto ( I made some name up so that he didn‚Äôt get worried) 
And then after reaching home I didn‚Äôt get a single text from him asking if I was okay there, whether I got back home etc? Which was sad coz I was litr his gf and he should have been concerned but instead he was having dinner with his friends. 
And I got mad and called me - he was at dinner in college and I yelled at him.
And asked to breakup and cried all night.
The next day morning he called to make up for it and spent an hr convincing me lol .
That night itself I saw a picture of girls who had gone clubbing w him and I didn‚Äôt get the best vibes from a particular girl and I was really insecure of her. She was his mutual (good friend of his best friend) 
And I was like wow u went w sm girls clubbing and didn tell me huh AHHAA and I was a bit mad abt it and then he just broke up w me‚Ä¶.
This was in Feb 2025.
Almost 2 years - 1 year 7 months ig to be more precise - of relationship and 2.5  years of friendship gone.
We didn‚Äôt stay in touch for 3 days and he asked for a closure on the 4th day.
We called and I cried and well he told that he wanted to get back but in three days of no contact he realised that the caste differences were an issue for me and he didn‚Äôt wanna do LD unless he had a confirmed yes for marriage and a long term thing
He asked if we cld be fuck buddies and I said I was unsure. And we decided to remain friends.
We fought a lot of times after that and a lot of I instances happened where it was his fault etc.
And then after a month he told me he didn‚Äôt wanna be friends anymore so i said ok cool and we didn‚Äôt talk at all except once in two weeks it wld just be a hi how r u text. 
And then on 30th April he video called me and just spoke (app he was tipsy acc to him) but idts .
He flirted a bit
and then we started talking again a bit on text and then he came back for vacation early coz of the Indian pak war.
we met 3 times - and we made out. It was planned in advance in those three months that we was here that we make out. He used to flirt with me and called me darling and babe etc.
Of course I felt special, and I thought we had something between us, and then he left for his college in July . Before he left that night, he video called me for two hours and we spoke.
When he went back to college, he stopped texting me, and he never really texted for us and would reply late to my messages. And then I confronted him about it. And he told me that we were just fuck buddies till the time he was here after going back, we would just be friends and he thought it was clear. And in his definition of good friends, he just texts once a month LOL.
Anyway, so now it‚Äôs October. We broke up in feb.
It‚Äôs been more than 8 months .
How do I move on? He was most of my firsts and my first boyfriend ever.
I need advice plsüôèüôèüôè

1o5qr6s,I feel free... yet empty?,"This is probably the last post I'll ever write about my on/off relationship/situationship with my ex of 5 years. It's bittersweet. 

I say so because we finally tried again for the last time, in my eyes. Prior to this, we were on/off no contact. I say on/off because he would get drunk and email me & I believe it every time because I will always love him. 

But I was focusing on myself. Plans of restarting my education in a field I love, thanks to him really, plans of getting my license, plans of everything, after we had broken up. But he emailed me again that opened the line to communication about 2 months ago. 

& we fell back into old ways of our relationship unspokenly, maybe because we missed each other, maybe because we hoped this would work out this time after 5 months of no contact. & it was great to start but then the lies started seething in again from him. Prior to us doing this again, part of me had started to let go what wasn't real anymore. Part of me started to see through the cracks of lies when he would tell me about the girls I shouldn't worry about. But he also made me believe that maybe I was just crazy and there wasn't anything going on. 

Until it came crashing down, as it always does. It was my fault to think that every time we got back together, he was going to be sweet, loving and caring, just like he was towards the younger girl that he dated no less than 1 month after we broke up exactly a year ago. But he comes back into my life thinking he can get away with everything, no affection, doing everything that he did for this other girl but doing absolutely nothing for me (picking her up from work after he already left for the day \[he was her manager\], when it was a burden to drive to see me). Counting every penny he spends with me but splurged on her like it was no big deal. 

I thank god for the Facebook post that crossed my page that day when we broke up to reaffirm, he was a 34 year old child who had commitment issues but blamed ME for commitment issues. 

""*He doesn't say, ""I broke her heart"" he says, ""she's crazy and paranoid."" He doesn't say, ""i hurt her over and over"" he says ""she's angry all the time.""*

I'm empty that I lost a best friend, someone who I was completely vulnerable with for 5 years when it took me **forever** to do so, but if that means I get to see a speck of happiness with someone else that I can also be completely vulnerable with, or better off just being alone and not be lied to or worried about being lied to or cheated on, then I'll take that because I guess he was never a real best friend to begin with. 

I hope he sees this if he does. Good bye Alex. It's been real. ",gnarlygnk,1760377653.0,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o5qr6s/i_feel_free_yet_empty/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o5qr6s/i_feel_free_yet_empty/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o5qow5,Letting go of his words,"
He said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to cheat on you.‚Äù
as if honesty could cleanse cruelty.
But truth without tenderness is a weapon,
and I was the one left bleeding from its edge.

He called it kindness ‚Äî
to walk away before he could ruin me.
But the ruin was already there,
in the distance of his eyes,
the silence that felt like being erased.

He said, ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt save me.‚Äù
And he was right.
I could not save a man drowning in his own denial.
I could only reach out ‚Äî
open-palmed, open-hearted ‚Äî
and watch him choose the undertow.

He said, ‚ÄúI still love her.‚Äù
And I whispered through tears, ‚ÄúI know.‚Äù
Because somewhere deep down,
I had always felt her ghost in the room ‚Äî
her shadow between our words.
It was never me who wasn‚Äôt enough,
it was him who was never whole.

Now, I gather his sentences like stones,
and set them down, one by one,
on the shore of my healing.
I do not carry them anymore.
They belong to the tide ‚Äî
to the letting go.

I am not the girl he left behind;
I am the woman who stayed for herself.
The one who learned that love
without kindness is not love at all.

I will grow softer, not smaller.
Wiser, not harder.
I will build a life that feels safe in its own light.
And when those words return to haunt me,
I will remember ‚Äî
they were never prophecies.
They were confessions of his limits,
spoken into the arms of someone
who deserved more than he could give.

I am still here.
Still whole.

I‚Äôm trying to find myself again after being totally and completely enveloped spiritually, emotionally, mentally, physically, by a man who I‚Äôve known for a long time doesn‚Äôt truly care about me. It‚Äôs been a year and a half of this and I‚Äôve wasted so much time and mental energy on this person but I don‚Äôt know how to fix it. I‚Äôve done what ""they"" say, I tried moving on, I went on dates, I moved out of my home country.. twice. I changed my surroundings, my career, my friends, I cut my hair off, I grew it back, I started reading again, I journal, I tried working out, I tried going out, I tried staying in, I poured my heart out to him to see if that would give me closure and nothing. I do all these interesting and amazing things that some people could only dream of and yet my life feels incomplete and unbearable without him. I can't listen to music, sad songs make me think of him, happy songs too, and even ‚Äòfuck that man,¬† you deserve better!‚Äô anthems feel patronizing and depressing. I don‚Äôt know how to let him go, I‚Äôve never been addicted to anything like this before in my life and even though I know he‚Äôs bad and doesn‚Äôt respect or love me I would go back in a heartbeat. I‚Äôd leave my job and my new apartment and the friends I've started to make just to be with him. I swam with sea turtles in the ocean yesterday, a life long goal, and I had to keep pushing thoughts of him from my head. I can't let him go. I don‚Äôt know how and I have this built up sadness and rage that feels like it's seeping through my pores. Everything feels so unfair, why did I have to meet him, why did I have to fall for him, why couldn‚Äôt my love have been enough for him and why do I have to sit here picking up the pieces while he‚Äôs already replaced me. I've never had an issue in cutting people off and moving on before him. I'm also afraid I'll never love anyone like I did him again, even when he lied, cheated, berated, and used me; I would marry him tomorrow if he asked me. I feel so insecure now, I had to delete social media because when I see a pretty woman now I compare myself to her and wonder if he‚Äôd try to sleep with her, what he‚Äôd say about her to his friends and what he says about me. He‚Äôs not even a ‚Äòcatch‚Äô, I‚Äôm so much more driven and interesting and smarter than him. I know all these things and I know it's stupid to feel how I do about him despite everything he‚Äôs done. I feel like a kicked dog that keeps returning because it doesn't know anything else. I cry everyday so loudly that my neighbor came to check on me. I feel physically ill when I think about it too much and some days I can‚Äôt even eat. And as illogical as I know it is I still feel like no one could possibly understand what I‚Äôm going through, I feel like part of my soul was ripped from inside of my body and now I have to walk around carrying this grief for the person I was when he loved me. He consumes all my thoughts. I could go on and on but I‚Äôm sure you get the idea. So my question is, what can I do? Not just the basic, oh give it time, put yourself out there, love yourself first stuff you always hear-- I don't even know how to get there at this point. I need tangible steps I can take towards ridding this man from plaguing my psyche. I need to learn how to live life again without him in it, I honestly cannot picture a life without him. I want to feel something besides anxiety and resentment and insecurity for once. I want to be happy again, does anyone know how?

1o5q718,I gotta stop texting her,"This is more or less just a vent. She started to leave two Saturdays ago. She came over one morning and just said I couldn't give her what she needed to be happy. I was shocked. Our one year was going to be October 11th. We met last summer just by chance, and it all just fell in to place.

We never had that slow phase of just talking and feeling each other out. It was like once we realized we liked each other she was just there. She stayed at my house on the nights she didn't have her daughter, and we often did kid stuff together with our girls on the weekends we had them. 

She often hinted at moving in,  but I made it clear I was wanting to take things slow especially with kids. We had one of the best years I I've had with another person. Constant trips, so many memories, and rarely no fighting. If we had a dispute we were good at solving it pretty quickly. 

I work alot, as guys my age do. I have a really bad habit of always putting work first, always wanting to make more money. By the end of the day, I was so tired I just had such little energy to give her the attention she needed. The weekends I didn't work I was just not there mentally. She always was very vocal about her love, very active on social media with pictures of us and what we were doing. Im not a fan of sharing everything on social media but started to like it. 

She showed me theres more to life then just working. She always wanted to go out and do stuff, I was always apprehensive but would go 90 percent of the time. We had a conversation about me not being emotional enough, not lovey dovey enough. So I was working on that and getting better, she often commented on it with appreciation. 

That Saturday it was like a light switch flipped in her. I convinced her to just stay for a little and enjoy the day we had planned. The day felt normal, but I could tell we both were emotionally just shut down. I was shocked, and she was just over it, but we had a good day/night. 

Sunday I was tired and got in my head really bad, just mad at myself. Instead of getting up and working on our relationship I just layed in bed all day. She joined me and we watched some Netflix series and ordered take out. 

Monday she texted me while I was at work, she was leaving. I pleaded with her not to, but ultimately wanted to respect her decision. We didn't talk until the next night I sent her a long message, and she responded the next day saying she missed me too and wanted to try to fix things. We had planned to talk that Saturday in person. 

But that conversation never came. Thursday morning she sent me a farewell text, hoping that her absence can give me the peace I need. I pleaded again, but I could tell she was done. She stated it was just best for her to walk away. She deleted all the photos of us, deleted me on all social media. 

Over the next few days, id send her random texts, just stuff throughout the day etc. but nothing really serious. 

I sent her a long email (it was a written letter originally but my handwriting is absolutely horrible and I genuinely worried it was too hard to read) this Saturday, not expecting to get an answer, but more of a farewell/how I recognized my issues and wanted to be better. 

I don't expect to hear back. I sent her a photo of us today, just with an I miss you and enjoy your day. Major regret as I feel like she's losing respect for me. She is a very emotional person and I just want to show her I want to be emotional with her.

How the hell do you stop just wanting to reach out to them. I am absolutely filled with regrets that I wasn't better to her, and know I can be better if she would just give me a chance. I think about her all day everyday, the future we could have had, if I was just better to her. I just can't accept this is how it ends, when I feel like we're one good conversation away from being happy. It's genuinely eating me alive.

1o5q4yt,My ex (30m) is dating someone new‚Ä¶ but we (me - 29F) were just sleeping together/seeing each other again.,"TL;DR:
My ex of 7 years and I split last year after his emotional affair. We share a 5-year-old and have stayed close‚Äîholidays, sleepovers, even sex. He went to therapy, started making time for family, and things felt like they were healing. I thought we were slowly reconciling. Then, out of nowhere, he tells me he‚Äôs seeing someone new (after spending 4 straight nights at her place). I‚Äôm heartbroken and confused (again)‚ÄîI still love him, and now he‚Äôs saying he ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt know‚Äù if he‚Äôs in love with me anymore. I don‚Äôt know how to handle this or if there‚Äôs any hope left.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

My ex of 7 years and I broke up last year due to his ‚Äúemotional affair.‚Äù For some people, emotional affairs are something you can work through, but when I found out about it, I was devastated. We have a (now) 5 year old, shared a home together, had a whole life together, and before dating, we were friends for years.

Since it‚Äôs been a while, I can see this from a Birds Eye view. We had our child pretty young, we both had to work twice as hard to get to a place where we could afford the highs and lows of adulthood and parenting. My ex worked a lot - didn‚Äôt come home every day until 8pm, worked weekends, and only had off two days during the week when I worked.

We were glorified roommates. And with that, there were fights. We were never on the same page, and it all stemmed from him wanting intimacy from me, and me wanting quality time with him. I wanted him to help out more around the house, he wanted me to notice that he already did. I wanted him to stop working so much, he wanted to keep doing it because he 1. liked his job, and 2. didn‚Äôt think we could afford it if he took away some overtime. 

When we were breaking up, he didn‚Äôt want me to leave. In my head, I wanted to move out and just get through this. I was so heartbroken and torn up about the whole thing. I just wanted out. We talked about maybe me signing a one year lease, and seeing how it went. I asked him to see a therapist, and to take off one weekend day a week. He started seeing a therapist, and the one weekend day thing took a while, but eventually happened. 

I moved out, and it was hard. I missed him, I missed being under the same roof as a family, but I was still hurt. I felt like he blew up our life over a few nude pictures and talking. And for months I thought - what if there was more and I‚Äôll never know? I know she was meeting with him at his work. They messaged and met in person. And the damage was done - I‚Äôll never know the truth there but the damage was already done and I was on my own and I just had to focus on my son, and me. 

Months go by. We celebrated the holidays together, birthdays. Had sleepovers and movie nights with our child. And we were occasionally having sex. Still talking all the time, arguing sometimes about the semantics of coparenting, but mostly things were good. 

Fast forward to a few months ago when we started sleeping with each other more often. More sleepovers, more time together. Then I got laid off (bummer but I‚Äôm surviving lol) and because we both had time during the week, we start doing normal things together - grocery shopping, errands, binge watching tv shows - while our son is at school. Making time for eachother without the pressure of ‚Äúfor the kid!‚Äù And it was so nice. And I started to think ‚Äúmaybe this could be something again.‚Äù He did everything I asked in the breakup, and he never gave up trying to get me back. Always telling me I could come home, always making it clear he still wanted this, wanted me. Up until two weeks ago, I thought we were finally on the same page. 

And then‚Ä¶.. last week I asked if he‚Äôd like to come over that Monday after school drop off. He says no, he has plans - totally okay! But things kept getting progressively more distant over the next few days. Short phone calls, early calls to say goodnight to our child, and I knew something was up. Suddenly he wanted nothing to do with me. So I asked him if he was seeing someone and he said yes. 

He met her online, spent 4 days in a row at her house, and it‚Äôs still new so he wasn‚Äôt going to say anything. They‚Äôre obviously sleeping together. And I took it POORLY. Still am. 

Now I‚Äôm telling him, I thought things were going so well, I thought we were going to get back together, my lease is almost up, I just needed time to see if things would change, we were literally just sleeping together two weeks ago how do you already have someone else, etc etc etc. I feel pathetic - pouring my heart out to this man. I feel like I‚Äôm running out of time, like he‚Äôll date this girl or go further with her and I won‚Äôt be able to get over it. Everything we built over these last few months will be lost. Again. 

He says he needs to think. He really likes her, he doesn‚Äôt know what to do. He said he doesn‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs still in love with me. 

How do I handle this? What do I even do now? And most importantly, will it ever really work now? 

I don‚Äôt want to be the ‚Äúvengeful baby mama‚Äù or the ‚Äúpick me, choose me‚Äù girl. I‚Äôm a grown woman. We have a life together, a family. I‚Äôm starting to think maybe I never should have left - and that makes me feel so pathetic. 

Please help me lol. I‚Äôm so lost and I don‚Äôt even know where to start with all of this.

Things ended kind of suddenly ‚Äî he said he needed space, that sharing locations wasn‚Äôt healthy, and that he just didn‚Äôt want to talk about it anymore.

1o5q29u,Working at ex's job,"Hey folks, I'm hoping people here can give me some insight. 

Long story short, I started working at an ex-boyfriend's work a couple weeks ago. He's been on leave, and returns this afternoon. We haven't talked since things between us fizzled out about 3 years ago. There's a lot of history there, but point is that we haven't talked and we didn't exactly end things with any kind of closure or whatever. 

I'm wondering if I should give him a heads up to expect to run into me, or to just see what happens when he shows up. I don't want to make it look like I should be so important to rattle him or anything, but I think I would also be kind of surprised to have my ex sort of appear out of nowhere unexpectedly.

1o5q163,Does She Still Have Lingering Feelings?,"A little over 2 months ago my ex (28F) ghosted me (29M) We had a series of fights that got worse and worse she was a DA and me being a FA led to a horrible push pull dynamic where I tried to gain closeness while she distanced herself. This led to me slipping back into alcoholism and threatening stupid things out of hurt feelings. Since then she discarded me and never acknowledged my existence or any of the times or feelings we shared. I poured my heart out on multiple occasions over the months only to be left on read.

She lived with me at the time and left a good amount of her belongings and went no contact for 2 months. I messaged her the other day asking if she wants her stuff or not and she finally messaged me back asking if she could come next Sunday and pick it up. I told her sure and told her I'd gather her stuff for her. 

For Mother's Day I got her a custom made book where I had a sweet sentimental message in the beginning dedicated to her. I also have her birthday card I got her along with a long love letter I had wrote her for her birthday. I asked her if she wanted me to put the book and her card/letter with her stuff or if she would just throw it away. (I would rather keep the items for myself than know she was just going to throw them in the trash) She has given off the impression that she doesn't care in the slightest about me or anything having to do with me. 

She replied and said why would I throw them away? And then asked if I wanted the Bible with my name engraved she had gotten me for my birthday. I told her ""Idk. And yes I want the Bible I've been wanting to ask you for that"" She then replied ""Are you actually going to keep the Bible or just throw it away?"" I told her I'm going to keep it bc it's sentimental and reminds me of the love we once shared and she just replied ""Okay."" And I left the conversation at that. 

To be honest part of the reason I asked what I did was to see if she even cared about our past since she never acknowledged it after leaving me. With her asking if I plan on keeping her gift she got me I'm wondering if she also feels the same way and let it slip through asking that question. She's not the type to make any direct acknowledgement that she has any feelings once the relationship ended. She will play it cool forever if she has to I just know she's that type of person after seeing how cold she treated her child's father after leaving him. 

Am I right by thinking she still has something lingering? It's a custom Bible with my name engraved on the front and she admitted at the end of the relationship that she is atheist so I know she has no reason to keep it herself. So why ask if I am actually planning to keep it or not? I know we aren't getting back together but just knowing I did mean something would make me feel much better after how she discarded me during the breakup. Do I say anything when she comes to pick her stuff up? Do I tell her I still love her and apologize again? Thanks in advance for any advice.

1o5pxkr,post breakup living situation,"we‚Äôve been together for almost two years, friends for almost 3. this feels like the most difficult thing i‚Äôve ever gone through, more than losing family, and i feel so hopeless. we both love each other so much but it has just not been working out. we had a lot of intimacy issues. he was a virgin before we dated so i‚Äôve been put in the place of having to teach a lot of things which was fine in the beginning but i felt like i was having to beg him to do his own research and take at least some of the burden of it off of me, and the amount of times i asked for this to happen vs. how much actually did was just too little, and it led to a lot of resentment towards each other, with me feeling like he wasn‚Äôt doing enough and him feeling like he was putting in more effort than me. this has led me to fall out of love with him i think and just overall desire to be with other people. and he hasn‚Äôt been happy either because he wants intimacy and affection and i just haven‚Äôt been able to give it to him in the way that he deserves. and it sucks so much. i want it to work so badly but we‚Äôre also both SO young and it‚Äôs probably just not the best idea to have to work so hard at making things work. i also don‚Äôt know how i can get myself to feel sexually attracted to him again and just want to be intimate in the ways that he and our relationship need.

1o5pvhn,Lost one of my best friends after we tried dating,"Me (22M) and my ex (23M) have known each other for almost 3 years by now. We met through Tinder in early 2022 while he was doing a study abroad in my country, but couldn't actually meet in person because of a few logistic problems. We hit off immediately and became fast friends, and kept talking after he went back to the US. We shared almost every aspect of our lives and were very close, often confiding to each other when in need. This summer we finally met in real life after several failed attempts throughout the years. I hosted him in Rome for a week: we had a great time together and after several heartfelt conversations, we decided to get into a commited relationship. 

He flew back to the US and I stayed in Italy, and we took our relationship long distance: I remember him saying that it was risky, but that even if the relationship at some point wasn't going to work out, he wanted to hold on to our friendship as it was very important to him. What followed were two months of very intense love, texting and facetiming every single day, promises and plans (I even booked a flight to go visit him for Thanksgiving and he was supposed to come visit me for a month in December/January). He wanted to get to know my family, my friends, even if for know he could only do so through text and video calls. I wanted to do the same. He told me he wanted to find a way for us to live in the same country and be happy together, wherever that was. I found it so wholesome because we used to joke around about getting married to each other when discussing about our failed relationships in the past. I thought we were so in love and we told each other that every day. 

Then something changed: he became more distant and started to respond less. At first he tried to explain to me that it was because of his mental health struggles, which I knew about before we had started dating, and that he was very overwhelmed with work and college. Still, he kept telling me that he loved me and that he wouldn't keep me in the dark about how he felt. 

Then at the end of August, he decided to end things: he told  that he just couldn't do it anymore, that maybe we took things too fast and that it would have been better if we'd just stayed friends. I was struggling to understand why: a few hours earlier he was telling me how much he loved me and how lucky he felt for having finally gotten into a relationship with me. I wanted to talk it out, and I admit, at first I wanted to make him reconsider his choice: to me it felt like giving up something that could have easily been fixed through mutual help and understanding. But it was probably too taxing for him, as we started to only talk about this. He told me that it seemed to him that I no longer cared about our past friendship and only cared about having him as my boyfriend, or to not have him in my life at all. 

We decided to stop taking for a while in order for me to move on and be ready to accept us going back to being friends. 
One night, exactly one month ago, I texted him saying that I wanted to start talking to him again, even though I hadn't completely moved on. 
His response to this was a text in which he told me to only text him after I was 100% sure I had moved on, and then, after a few minutes, he blocked me, all my friends he knew and even my mom everywhere. This was the thing that threw me off the most because he always expressed how valuable our friendship was to him and how he wanted to resolve any issue with conversation. 

It's been a month now and I'm trying to just roll with what happened. Don't even know what kind of advice I would ask for. I don't even care about the relationship part, I just miss my friend

She asked if I‚Äôm free this week. I told her I‚Äôll have to check my schedule (I‚Äôm not that busy, but I didn‚Äôt want to seem too eager). She lives in the same area as me.

The thing is‚Ä¶ even though I told myself (and her) that it‚Äôs just a friendly hangout, my mind keeps planning it like it‚Äôs a ‚Äúdate‚Äù ‚Äî like movie, bowling, beach, etc. 

I don‚Äôt want to give her the wrong idea or false hope, especially since I know I haven‚Äôt fully moved on from my ex yet.

How do I tackle this?

1o5pa7v,We still live together,"I spent a long time forgiving him and trying to teach him to do better. But I eventually realized that people that truly love you, respect you as well. And you‚Äôre allowed to leave when you‚Äôre not being treated with respect. 

He was lying to me repeatedly about a couple things. I knew he was lying, and gave him many chances to tell me the truth. I told him I could forgive him for lying if he just owned up to it now, but if he kept lying then I‚Äôd have to leave. He chose to keep lying and manipulating, so I ended things last week. 

He‚Äôs always been avoidant, and one time he even agreed when I told him ‚Äú I feel like you won‚Äôt start trying in this relationship until I try to leave‚Äù. 

Of course, he didn‚Äôt accept it when I told him we were over. I told him I‚Äôll allow him to pursue me, but the relationship is over and I won‚Äôt be focused on dating. 

I‚Äôve always been the one begging him to try and fighting for this relationship. I really tried so hard and I was so empathetic to his perspective that I lost myself at some points. 

Ever since I broke up with him I‚Äôve felt so much freedom. Even tho we live together, I‚Äôm finally able to be myself. I was always waiting on him, wondering when he was going to start trying again, asking myself where we went wrong. 

I think it‚Äôs really hitting him though. I showed him an edit of Finn and Flame princess from adventure time, because it reminded me a lot of us. He asked for me to hold him while he cried afterwards. I came to him with all these problems so many times that I think he underestimated how serious I was this time about leaving.

It is really overwhelming though, looking for places and sharing a car while going through a breakup. Not to mention I still love him, his actions just forced me to set boundaries. 

Sending love to others going through something similar. We are extremely brave for leaving someone we love because we know we deserve better.

1o5p7x1,My online girlfriend broke up with me because I didn't texted her often,"So I (M 20) met her(F 21) on Omegle and she also liked me. I wasn't interested on her first but later talking to her online through instagram, it was really good and i developed interest on her , i really made her laugh and have fun with me, it was all going well until I gamed a lot and didn't texted her often like daily, before that I used to text her and have serious conversation with her everyday so, oneday she said it will good for us to stop this, she thought that I wasn't interested in her after 2-3 months but it wasn't like that I was gaming a lot and didn't texted her i was too invested in gaming and i apologised her often that I can't text her. But oneday after not texting her for a day,she said ""okay I will not disturb you anymore"" she thought she was disturbing me thinking I wasn't interested in her, but It was not true and I said before I was gaming a lot.
I talked to her and she refused ""i still love you but it was better if we stop it now it is good for both of us take care"" but I said sorry if had done anything wrong. it was actually second time. The first time she said the same thing and i said it was really not like that I don't like her.she was convinced and we had few weeks going well and then for few days I didn't texted her and thats when it all started, and she unfollowed me and also removed me from her followers.

1o5p6ll,"I will never trust her again, why people are like this","A year back I was really going through a hard time. I lost my sister and that same night I had a job interview which didn‚Äôt go as expected. I was completely down, so I went on an online platform just to vent a bit, hoping I might feel better. That‚Äôs when I met this girl from Europe. I‚Äôm from Asia.

She already had a boyfriend but we still continued to talk. We shared snaps, talked every day and night for hours, and honestly it felt good. I felt like I found someone I could really talk to. She was genuinely nice.

One day I asked her, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre in a relationship and you‚Äôre good, what if your boyfriend finds out we talk this much?‚Äù She said, ‚Äúit‚Äôs fine, don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôll take care of it.‚Äù  
We became really close friends, sharing things about our countries, photos, calls, culture, likes and dislikes. We talked almost every day for a year.

I‚Äôm 21 and I‚Äôve never felt that kind of connection with anyone. When she used to go out with her boyfriend, I‚Äôd feel jealous. She felt the same whenever I talked to other girls. But she was always too cautious not to mess up her relationship, so she used to hide me from her boyfriend.

One day her boyfriend noticed my text and she panicked. She told me she didn‚Äôt want to talk anymore. I felt so sad. I asked her to talk to her boyfriend and sort it out, but she blocked me everywhere. I kept trying to convince her for 40 days straight, every single day, but she was cold and distant. She said, ‚Äúyeah this should have ended way earlier, my bad, I did wrong talking to you but now I want to end this.‚Äù

It broke me. I was really sad for months, feeling betrayed, even though deep down I knew she was in a relationship. I stayed because I didn‚Äôt want to see her sad. I know I messed up too, but at that time I just wanted someone to talk to.

Then a month ago, she came back again. She said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I did wrong, I shouldn‚Äôt have done that, I feel bad for leaving you. I want us to be like before.‚Äù  
And honestly, I said okay. I know I shouldn‚Äôt have let her back into my life, but I did.

Now though, I feel paranoid every time she replies late. I keep thinking maybe she‚Äôll leave me again, and that makes me anxious and leads to fights. At first she said, ‚Äúeven if you get mad, I‚Äôll never give up on you, I‚Äôll fight back and stay.‚Äù I felt good hearing that. I thought this time it‚Äôll be different.

But whenever she goes out with friends or studies, I get annoyed because I want to spend time with her. Sometimes I fight about that too. I tell her, ‚Äúbe nice to me even if I‚Äôm mad, my intentions aren‚Äôt bad, I just want to spend time with you, that‚Äôs it.‚Äù

But lately, every time we fight, she just says, ‚Äúif you want to leave, leave. I won‚Äôt come back again, don‚Äôt worry.‚Äù And that hurts because just a month ago she said she‚Äôd never give up on me, and now again I feel thrown away.

now this time i blocked her and feel so bad ik i have work to do but i was about to heal but she came and ruined again for me. why do poeple do this i can't sleep well, i can't work well i constantly think of same thing. idk how she get's annoyed when i bring like im hurt when you do this she gets annoyed cause it makes her feel bad so i shouldn't complain. when i complain she goes like ""oh yeah im the bad person now"". Everytime i wanna go logical she get's annoyed and always avoid the conversation and when it's time to sort things she avoid and tell why to think of bad thing and be sad move on. Since that are never sorted out i feel bad all the time.

Everytime when i complain something to her she can't listen and always gets annoyed cause im complaining too much that feels like im so much stuck, yeah the way i say things aren't really good way i get mad but i can't help myself.

The thing i feel bad about this is when she is busy and out she doesn't care cause she is distracted that time and she is like yeah you can leave if you want and act tough but when she gets alone she realize no shit where is he and gets hurts and reach out, i feel so unfair how can you be so inconsistent

ik now again i will have to spend time with gpt asking where did i go wrong and heal through this for months.

I need a help how to move on, it feels so bad i have work to do and study, should i unblock her and resolve this? or just block her and never talk to her again and not even let her in my life again.

1o5om4w,How do you know it is time for a breakup ?,"Hello, I (25M) have always have a hard time understanding my feelings, specially love-related ones. I've been with my boyfriend (21M) for over a year and I do feel like I love him.

This year I've been mentally struggling with myself (stress, anxiety and sudden sadness). This week I've decided to be proactive about myself and get some professional help, because my emotions lately have not been normal.

For the past few months, I've been having this idea of breaking up with him because I don't think being in a relationship right now is helping me at all. Of course it's not his job to deal with my mental health, but he also has needs that I can't comply because I'm here struggling even to go trough a normal day...

My question comes because, I never know when it is time to break up. This is my 3rd relationship, for the 1st one I mourned him inside of the relationship and when we broke up It felt right, for the 2nd one I had the initial thought but I never did it, and then he broke up with me and it was after we broke up that I understood that i wanted to be with him for longer.

With this one it breaks my heart thinking of making him cry or sad because of this, but at the same time I don't even feel like the same person I was at the beggining of the relationship, I don't feel like he understands me and I don't think I'm going to fulfil his needs (And I don't think he is going to understand that...). He is nice towards me and I still love him, and I know he loves me too but I feel numb/automatic and it is not his fault... I don't want to breakup and then spent months feeling guilty and like I shouldn't have burn that bridge or regretting it.... 

So when do you know it is actually the time to break up?",catus752,1760373105.0,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o5om4w/how_do_you_know_it_is_time_for_a_breakup/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o5om4w/how_do_you_know_it_is_time_for_a_breakup/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False

Im so proud of myself because I knew that I really let myself went through the normal process without using any people. 

I dealt with the uncomfortable feeling. Truly sit with it until its gone. 

I did hook up though in my 2nd and 3rd month i think but its okay, that helped me realize as well that its not gonna help me fill the void, in fact it made it deeper so i stopped 

what i did: 
deactivated my ig. 
muted EVERY common friends that me and my ex have so i wont see him a accidentally since i dont want to unfriend them.

Im literally only speaking to my friends who's been with me on this journey. 

I listen to Mel Robbins Podcast everytime i commute to and from work, and it really helped me process my emotions. It's like having a talk therapy even when im only listening. If you have money for therapy, go do it. Listening to podcast isnt substitute but it truly helps.

JOURNALING! ü§çü§ç 
and those advices in tiktok that resonates with me. 

I wouldn't wish that kind of pain to anyone but knowing that there are people out there, who's going through the same thing as you makes you realize that you're not alone and suddenly you're okay. 

I hope everyone heals from break ups.

1o5nmk8,my feelings as the one who left,"Gods where to start, I think the more you loved this person the more it hurts. I cry everyday like literally everything reminds me of him, potatoes where his favorite food and I can‚Äôt see one or remember one before crying. I had to end it, not because he didn‚Äôt make me happy, but because he disappointed me and we weren‚Äôt growing up personally. He didn‚Äôt want to work and he came back and change once he lost me. This hurt like hell. 

Why after losing me, why after I had gave you the world? I did give it another try, but my nervous system collapsed when trying again, crying, anxiety and obsessive thoughts over and over again, I lived the dream we had this last month after ending things because of my mental health. 

I am so sorry because I genuinely wanted to give it another try, but at the moment I hadn‚Äôt forgive you. I know I love you but i don‚Äôt want to be with you, I think of you everyday and am scared I will forgive the happiest three years of my life thank you, I just want you to be happy, and grow into the man you want to be. 

The relationship ended because of the awful communication we had, and the codependency I had at some point. Both of us were stuck and with all the love I had to you go. I do not regret anything you were the first man who made me believe in love, I remember I always say I would be the rich auntie with a lot of cats, then you came as a sun at my lowest depression, I still think we forced out things(LDR) but destiny made everything happen. 

It‚Äôs been 5 days of no contact and it really hurts me, I worry about you everyday but am not mentally okay to be in a relationship right now. Just gotta say it Thank You, for showing me that I deserve that kind of love that is generous and sincere, you have a part of my heart in yours as I have part of your in mine.

1o5n59g,Ex decided to block me everywhere and I miss him,"Ours was tumultuous relationship. We met 8 months and it was love (for the both of us) from the first time we saw each other. Things were perfect in the start, he was kind and loving and I was trying my best to be the gf that he deserved. Until it was not. Fights started over tiny things. We both came to realise we had deep rooted issues - his insecurities and abandonment issues and my anger issues and childhood trauma. He would say something that would be triggering and I would get annoyed and it would spiral out ruining weeks of our precious time with each other. Still we tried. We were happy with each other, loved and cared like we were each others‚Äô world, we went on vacations, helped each other in our personal and professional lives, went for walks and gyms and dinners and shopping. And everything that you‚Äôd want from a relationship. But then we fought, we were happy for 4 days and depressed for 3.

We broke up (for a day or 2) a couple of times in the 8 month relationship but then decided our love was worth all the trouble and decided to get back together. Until last week. A petty fight snowballed and to stop him from saying mean stuff to me, I said I‚Äôd like to break up. He took that seriously and said this is it. It‚Äôs not worth it this time.

I was in shock the first day but also a tiny bit relieved cuz I felt like things were getting worse. However after the breakup we decided to meet and give each other some closure and that‚Äôs when I realized that I‚Äôll never get over this guy and he‚Äôs my soulmate. We hugged and cried for 4 hours and then he left. He wanted to go no contact but I made the biggest blunder, I went to his house late night to and give him a gift I was making for him. I was not necessarily hoping to see him but once I got closer I started panicking that this guy, this guy that I love is here and I just need to see him and hug him and tell me how much I love him. But he never opened the door. I stood outside crying for almost 2 hours but he never opened the door. I did not make a scene to embarrass him but I‚Äôm so embarrassed my self. I feel pathetic. Pathetic because he knew I was outside and didn‚Äôt open the door and I have realised I probably meant nothing to him.

After that, he said he wanted to go NC, he blocked me from every platform possible, we work together in the same company and he‚Äôs even blocked me on work chats.

It‚Äôs been a week and I have not slept, I‚Äôm not eating, I‚Äôm not able to focus on work and I‚Äôm back on anxiety medication.

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I apologised to him 100 times before he blocked me. I apologised for suggesting to break up, for letting my anger issues control this relationship, I apologised for not putting in more effort. But the thing is, I believe with all my being that it was never me who was only at fault, and I know that it‚Äôs both of our shortcomings that led to this. 
It‚Äôs just that I‚Äôm willing to take the entire blame on myself because I want to hold on to our relationship. 
I told him I‚Äôll get therapy, I‚Äôll work on myself, I made a list of things to tackle but he still blocked me. I‚Äôm angry that he decided what‚Äôs right for the both is us. And I‚Äôm left with nothing, no love, no self respect, no future. I can‚Äôt stop crying, I can‚Äôt stop taking my medication and I can‚Äôt stop missing him and hating myself for missing him. I‚Äôm praying he comes back to me but I know his ego won‚Äôt allow it.

1o5mtv0,"I‚Äôm thinking I‚Äôm ready to move on I‚Äôm hoping this story will help others too, the depression does end if you don‚Äôt!","It was a week before my birthday in 2019 when my ex walked out of my life.
The timing made it worse ‚Äî not just the heartbreak, but the quiet cruelty of it happening right before a day that was supposed to be mine. I remember standing behind the counter at work, shoulders heavy, trying not to look as hollow as I felt.

That‚Äôs when Kat noticed me.
She was a cashier with a warm smile and an instinct for reading faces.

She asked softly, ‚ÄúHey, how are you doing?‚Äù

I don‚Äôt know why I was honest with her. Maybe because I was tired. Maybe because the truth was too close to the surface to bury.

‚ÄúMy ex broke up with me,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúand Friday‚Äôs my birthday, so I‚Äôm kinda shitty to be honest.‚Äù

She smiled like she saw something worth saving in me. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry. You‚Äôre cute. You‚Äôll find somebody.‚Äù

Her voice was simple, light ‚Äî but something about it stuck.

Over the next week, we talked in passing. Little things at first. Then, after my birthday, I asked her out. She said yes.

April 9, 2019.
Our first date. Applebee‚Äôs.

She told me early on she only wanted to be friends. I laughed it off, split the bill, and stayed anyway. Because something in the way she smiled across that table felt different.

We talked until the restaurant closed, then sat in my car for hours, trading flirtatious words we pretended not to mean. The air between us was charged but quiet, like a match that hadn‚Äôt been struck yet.

When I got home, I messaged her to say I made it safely. The conversation picked up where it had left off ‚Äî a little bolder this time, a little closer to the edge. Flirting turned into late-night confessions, late-night confessions turned into heat.

The next day, the match finally struck.

By the end of April, she asked, ‚ÄúAre we‚Ä¶ dating?‚Äù
I smiled, asked her to be my girlfriend, and she said yes. Just like that.

Everything moved fast.
New jobs. Long nights together. A kind of young love that feels unbreakable while it‚Äôs happening.

For our first Christmas, I found her an old PS3 ‚Äî the one she used to dream about owning. I cleaned it, replaced the hard drive, wrapped it carefully, and watched her light up like a kid again. She loved it. I loved watching her love it.

When the pandemic hit, everything shifted. I lost my job, found another, and we kept building our little life together. And then‚Äî

November 28, 2020.
My father died.

She came over that night, wrapped her arms around me, and we held each other in a kind of silence that says what words can‚Äôt. That night, we made love. And in that quiet, in that grief, our daughter was conceived.

I felt it happen. I just‚Ä¶ knew.

Weeks later, before Christmas, she told me she was pregnant. The world could have been falling apart around me and it wouldn‚Äôt have mattered. I felt joy. Pure, terrifying, overwhelming joy.

Christmas came. We told her mom. She cried happy tears.
But then came the doubts. The whispers of a choice she didn‚Äôt want to make but couldn‚Äôt ignore. She talked about abortion, and hearing it splintered something inside me.

I told her, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs your choice. I‚Äôll be here no matter what you decide. But if you end it‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know if we‚Äôd survive it. Not because I‚Äôd leave. Because something in me would change.‚Äù

She decided to keep the baby. At first, she wanted adoption. I told her, ‚ÄúThen I‚Äôll raise our kid. You don‚Äôt have to be in their life.‚Äù She hesitated. She didn‚Äôt want to lose me.

In the end, she chose us. We painted walls. Built cribs. Dreamed of the future.

And then our daughter was born.
Tiny. Perfect. A miracle I never thought I‚Äôd hold in my arms.

Everyone said I was a good dad. I always said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all Kat. She‚Äôs an amazing mom.‚Äù

For a while, we believed it.

But our daughter‚Äôs words started to fade. ‚ÄúMama‚Äù and ‚ÄúDada‚Äù disappeared into silence. After months of appointments, the doctors said what no parent is ready to hear: autism. They told us she might never speak.

That night, I opened myself to Kat completely. I told her how scared I was, how much it hurt to think I might never hear ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù from my little girl.

But instead of holding me, she broke down into her own storm, drowning my pain in her guilt.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm a bad mom,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my fault.‚Äù

So I comforted her. That night, a wall began to grow between us. A quiet wall, made of the things we never said again.

I told myself I had to be strong ‚Äî for both of them. So I stopped talking about my pain. I kept showing up. But the fights started. Little arguments that became storms.

I told her to stop. She didn‚Äôt. So I got louder. She twisted my words into new blades to throw back at me. I shut down. She promised to change, but by then I had already started leaving in my head.

She talked to other guys behind my back. I didn‚Äôt know then. I just felt it.

She told me about some younger woman at work with big breasts, how jealous she felt. I tried to comfort her, not realizing the real reason for her tears. Later, she cried in my arms over a man who had chosen someone else ‚Äî not realizing I‚Äôd soon find out it was her who wanted him.

Then came April 2025.
She had a new friend from work. Another guy.

He invited us to dinner. She flirted openly. I sat there with a toothache and quiet rage burning under my ribs. April 9th ‚Äî six years to the day since our first date ‚Äî and she was laughing with him like I was a shadow at her side.

On the drive home, she asked why I was so quiet. I didn‚Äôt answer. She pushed. I snapped.

‚ÄúYou told him you wanted to blow him,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou made it disgusting. You disrespected me.‚Äù

She denied it, but that night she disappeared into the dark with her phone. When I found her, she admitted to it ‚Äî phone sex.

I broke. She begged me to stay. I did. I told myself I could forgive something that ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt physical.‚Äù

But the truth doesn‚Äôt stay buried.

I caught her talking to him again. I left. She begged me back. I came home. We tried couples therapy. She smiled like things were fixing themselves.

Then I saw the green bubbles. Another man. Another lie.

I told her, ‚ÄúAfter everything, I can‚Äôt trust you talking to another guy. Not now.‚Äù

She agreed.
An hour later, she left me ‚Äî for him.

‚∏ª

Looking back, I can see it all like a film projected onto a cracked wall.
The beginning ‚Äî warm, bright, golden.
The middle ‚Äî love and the weight of real life pressing down.
The end ‚Äî quiet betrayal dressed as something inevitable.

But somewhere in all of it, there‚Äôs a little girl.
A light that came from pain, from loss, from love that was real even if it didn‚Äôt last.
She‚Äôs the part of the story that doesn‚Äôt break.

She‚Äôs the part I‚Äôll always hold

It‚Äôs strange how love changes shape over time.

For the first time in years, there‚Äôs someone new in my life ‚Äî and it feels different. Not rushed. Not forced. Just‚Ä¶ real. I find myself wanting to take it slow, to actually feel the connection instead of grabbing at it to fill some hollow place inside me. I want to know that when I reach out for her, it‚Äôs because I see her ‚Äî not just a distraction from the past.

With her, I‚Äôm not chasing a high or trying to stitch up old wounds. I‚Äôm standing still, breathing, letting something new unfold. And that alone feels like a kind of healing I didn‚Äôt know I was capable of.

Last night, a photo popped up on my phone ‚Äî an old memory of Kat and our daughter. Just an ordinary picture taken years ago, back when we still believed in forever. In the photo, Kat‚Äôs looking at me with a love I used to drown in. It used to be the kind of look that made everything else disappear.

But this time‚Ä¶ I saw something different.

I saw her face ‚Äî the same face I once thought was the most beautiful thing in the world ‚Äî and I felt nothing. Not the way I used to. Not the soft ache. Not the pull. I saw the love frozen in her eyes, but it didn‚Äôt belong to me anymore. It felt like a relic. A fossil from a life that no longer exists.

And then something I never expected happened.
I saw her as‚Ä¶ ordinary. Even a little ugly. Not because she‚Äôs a monster. Not because she changed. But because I changed. The illusion I held of her ‚Äî the beauty carved out of my own longing ‚Äî had finally dissolved.

It‚Äôs a quiet kind of closure, the kind that doesn‚Äôt arrive with anger or tears. It just‚Ä¶ settles.

For years, I thought moving on meant forgetting. But maybe it really means seeing them as they are not the dream I once made them into.

And maybe, just maybe, it means opening my heart to something new. Something real.",bugledaily1125,1760369239.0,2,0.75,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o5mtv0/im_thinking_im_ready_to_move_on_im_hoping_this/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o5mtv0/im_thinking_im_ready_to_move_on_im_hoping_this/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False

1o5mpyi,Stop checking your ex's social media,"I know it's difficult. You're not in contact but you want to know what's going on in their life. More importantly, you want to see how they're doing without you. But the truth is most people won't advertise their hurt online, especially if they were the one who wanted the breakup. Chances are you will only make yourself feel worse by checking your ex's socials. And don't forget that everything on social media is fake. People can post and say anything.

I'm 2 months into my breakup and until a week ago I was checking my ex's social media pages every single day. I clung to any little hint that he missed me or regretted his decision to end our relationship. But any time I saw something that indicated he was fine and moving on it made me feel sick. It's taking a lot of discipline but I'm managing to keep myself off his profiles because I know there is a higher chance I will find something I don't want to see than something I do. 

Like I said, social media is fake. I myself have posted about doing great and moving on. This couldn't be further from the truth. I miss my ex everyday still.

1o5mnqc,Was I manipulative towards my ex? Be brutally honest,"I've been out of my first relationship for about five months; we broke up but talked for about two months yet we argued more and I cut her off after a particularly bad argument. I reached out about two months later and it went just as poorly. It's been hard to talk to people seriously about it because most of my friends just point out the red flags. I think it's helpful for next time but it feels like they deny her accountability, as well as mine.  
  
I tried to be the bigger person throughout our relationship. From the start, we set the boundary of respecting each other's independence, so I thought adhering to it was a better idea than being desperate. However, I think this lead to me putting a lot of blame on myself and ignoring when she couldn't commit to our relationship. She has an abusive homelife and her mother forbade us from dating. To be fair, she didn't tell her until a few months in. I managed to visit her for the first time since I moved too. I felt terrible for how her mom treated her and told my mom, because she planned to come to see me originally. She told me to set some goals for her to gain independence for her sake but also mine, to see if she'd commit enough to herself but also a relationship. I asked if she could work on driving more frequently so she could be more independent, get her own bank account, and work on moving out of her house. I also wanted her to make sure she could afford and attend college if she didn't have financial assistance from her family, which I could provide. Keep in mind that her family is very well off yet infantilize her, but I could've provided for the both of us or at least helped her with these things once I moved.  
  
We started dating in real life but I moved to finish my associate's degree and was going to transfer back to where she lived. However, either right before or after I visited her, she said she didn't want to live together (we'd been dating for eight months at this point, spent the weekends together for three months, and cohabited on vacations twice for a total of two weeks). She admitted she felt like she kept jumping from relationship to relationship, as she hadn't been out of one for years. It seemed like she was throwing the things she asked me in my face. Keep in mind her saying she doesn't want to feel defined by a relationship, and wants independence from a partner, but is still setting goals she's less likely to achieve on her own.  
  
When I visited, she mentioned having memory issues. We discussed a friend of her ex-partner who abused her that added to the abuse and I tried to be sympathetic to him, mentioning that he was likely neglected as a child. She is also in school for social services, so I thought she would relate. About two months later, I brought it up again thinking she remembered, because she didn't respond poorly before, and we got into an argument. We argued about small things but we started agreeing to disagree; if we kept coming back to it, I would ask if we could sleep on it. I didn't try to be avoidant, I always wanted to directly revisit any disagreements with calmer heads. After this point, it felt like a switch turned. She asked to go on ""break"" and I admittedly said something hurtful, ""I'd rather be in a bad relationship than none at all."" I blurted it out of shock, I meant something along the lines of ""I'd prefer to work on a relationship than let it die,"" and she held this over my head, like she did the argument about her ex's friend. I assume she might blame him for how her ex treated her. It's easier to blame a third party than your partner, even a previous one.  
  
It felt like she wouldn't agree to disagree anymore. If we started to argue, I'd ask if we could talk about it later and, if we were calling, she would either remain completely silent until I felt forced to ask if she was still upset over the argument, or she would still be just as angry as before. Even before that, she would often take out her anger at her friends or family on me, then later admit that was why she was angry and just took it out on me. Because of this, I wouldn't take what she said personally, even though she would get more personal and hold onto grudges for days at a time. I wanted her to be more independent and give her space, so I was fine with her hanging out with them. However, they are incredibly toxic and rude to her, as well as me when I gave them rides or was fine hanging out with them. Most of these people are spoiled rich kids, and I feel like she took on a lot of their qualities. She would vent about her friends yet keep hanging out with them, and I mentioned that the way one of her friends treated her was similar to how I felt she treated me, and she just ignored me.  
  
She also began hanging out with her male feminist friend. This guy she had to cut off twice for calling her a ""confused lesbian,"" then freaked out when we started dating and cut her off for a while. I'm also pretty sure he watched Destiny (the king of revenge p\*rn) based off some of his takes. He came back into the picture after I visited, so maybe he realized we weren't seeing each other in person at that point. They got very close and went to events together. At this time, one of her friends introduced her to weed and she is a recovering alcoholic. An aside, smoking weed was honestly what made me not want to get back together. I am sober by choice because addiction runs in my family and I've seen it ruin many close people's lives. She got high at an event and she found out he put her head in his lap and was stroking her head while whispering things to her. Another friend rightfully called him out but she didn't seem phased by the event. She mentioned seeing him more and I was suspicious if they were cheating. I talked to my therapist and she said that, whether she was doing it consciously or not, she was emotionally cheating with him, if not physically. On a video call, she asked me to flex for her, and I felt weird after doing it and talked to her the next day. She decided she wanted to end it to be friends with benefits with this guy. We were planning to try to mend things in a few months because she was coming to an event in my state, but she couldn't last that long.  
  
I think, to some extent, she had to start breaking up as soon as her mom said we couldn't date, and she mentally and emotionally prepared herself for it months prior. She chose her family's money over our happiness, even though I have a stable income and was willing to move for our relationship but also give her space. However, during our break and after our breakup, I spent my time finishing my degree, going to talk and physical therapy, and caring for my elderly cats my mother couldn't afford to care for. She started smoking weed, slept around, and had her mother do college work for her (she would wake up at 2PM and stay up until 4 or 5). I would try to be patient when she would scream at me but ended up being numb and just hoped she would get over her other problems like I was getting over mine. I was still moving back to her state for college, As much as I wanted to be there for her, she didn't address her problems with her friends and family and just coped with substances, spending, and sex/p\*rn. We couldn't/can't form a relationship because I stopped respecting her, solely pitying her. She became less generous, kind, etc. and was angrier after spending lots of time with her friends, but I felt like it'd be manipulative to say I thought she was being self destructive or had poor taste in friends.  
  
She also became more misandrist and hung out with a lot of feminists/transgenders. I am not here to promote bigotry but these groups can be in an echo chamber. I felt blamed for being masculine but then convinced to be more feminine because I'm not super masculine nor feminine. She was attracted that I had muscle and was athletic but not that I defended my gender. Also, she would blame men for SA, but it felt like how racist people talk about minorities. She was unreceptive to the idea that most victims of violence are men and that there's more victim than perpetrators in general, or saw it as ammo for the patriarchy and partisan politics instead of an issue to be addressed. Asides from her male feminist FWB definitely having ulterior motives, her transgender friends shared shota gore in a group chat, so I don't think they have a moral high ground to blame all men for SA. (If you don't know what shota is, look it up at your own expense. NSFL.) I am a moderate centrist so I'm not against someone having different political beliefs than me, as I can understand/empathize with most normal beliefs, but it felt like she resorted to cry-bullying or concern trolling after hanging out with them when she also used to be more moderate.  
  
A month after we broke up, she came out that she might also be transgender. I personally would not want to date a transgender but could see how she could be one. I am referring to her by female pronouns because, last I remember, she is gender fluid. However, she then said that she didn't think she had BPD and that she didn't need therapy for it, she just needed testosterone. She would often pin the blame on her yelling and anger issues on BPD and said she wanted help but her family wouldn't get it for her. However, they were willing to get her a psychological battery, ADHD medicine, Anxiety and Depression diagnoses, and paid for her to go to therapy. She didn't respond well to her therapist but I can't tell if she was completely honest with her therapist, because she'd tell me she forgot things. She may have thought she was smarter than her therapist, despite still being a student, or thought she could treat herself, but I never wanted to treat her. After she stopped seeing this therapist, she lagged in finding a new one, and I kept asking her to because we both admitted I wasn't able to help her and that it wasn't an inadequacy on my part. Whether or not she has BPD, she pinned a lot of blame on it, a lot of which is still on her. As hard as that can be, we are ultimately responsible for our actions, No amount of trauma, mental disorder, etc. is a justification for treating someone poorly, your intentions are an explanation at best, not an excuse.  
  
It felt like she was now shifting blame to something and deciding not to receive treatment for BPD either instead of or in addition to gender dysphoria. She directly complained about one of her friends was in therapy for most of his life but was only diagnosed with gender dysphoria and never got treatment or diagnoses for any other conditions. I felt like she was escaping responsibility and, when she mentioned that HRT could be dangerous for her physical and mental health, she sarcastically said that she was killing herself on other medicines, including birth control. For context, she only took this to manage her periods, not for sex, but implied then it was for me, even though I used protection after she stopped taking it. I said she was being careless and her take was uneducated. This was admittedly immature and dodging my actual issue, but this was something I'd mentioned before just to be ignored. She just yelled ""who hurt you?"" ""this is why you have no friends!"" and other concern-trolling memes and I just laughed because she was so unhinged and spoke like someone she'd have made fun of a few months earlier. Mind you, when we went on break she said she felt bad for being so mean to me after talked to my mom. She actually cried and, while I felt bad for making her cry, I didn't think I said or did anything wrong. I obviously said things I shouldn't have and didn't take the high ground, but I felt worn down. I was ashamed of how I acted, but felt like it was a sign we couldn't even stay friends because we'd both changed so much. Also, I didn't hang out with my old friend group or make a lot of new friends because I'd go to be online with her as much as I could, which still wasn't enough for her because I was in school and doing other things.  
  
We were still set to see each other but, if we weren't seeing a mutual friend, I would've called it off. She asked about places to go and I shot down one of her suggestions but she went and researched it and said we should've gone and she really wanted to, so I apologized and said we could go if she really wanted. She then kept digging and exaggerating what I said, and I asked if she could just accept my apology and she continued to berate me while ignoring what our mutual said, even though she was relating to him over having overprotective parents. She brought out her emotions over a petty issue after it was settled, which describes a lot of our later arguments. She also asked to stop arguing then tried getting the last word after I stopped. She said her other friends didn't argue like we did and I told her they just give half assed apologies, hurt her worse than I ever did routinely, and are manipulating her but she said she was fine with it and I dropped it at that.  
  
When we met up, her mom dropped her off in a piss soaked parking garage but we couldn't find her and she yelled at me and said I did this to her on purpose. Thankfully, my friend vouched for me and made it out like I was trying to be protective. The truth is that I couldn't find her and wasn't doing it on purpose, but I didn't help her for any specific reason. I did it because it was the right thing, it wouldn't matter if she were my friend, partner, or a stranger, I'd have done the same. I think this is a big difference between us. However, we were cordial and she would get touchy at times, etc. but I tried staying completely platonic. There was an issue where we were trying to split the bill for some food and we were freaking out and she wouldn't use Zelle and I asked why and she admitted she never got a bank account, which she told me she had earlier for her independence, so she lied. She also didn't volunteer to pay for everyone's food, which she would've done when we first met because she was more generous. I don't think she's capable of being independent and threw my goals for her in my face because she never wanted to live on her own and set unrealistic expectations so she had an excuse not to meet them. But we ended cordially and I asked her if we could stay friends like this and she agreed.  
  
She told me she still loved me and cared a lot, I assumed platonically, and I wanted to give being friends another try. However, she went abroad with another friend, who is a diagnosed sociopath who flirts with older men to buy her drinks. She essentially used my ex as a human shield in a foreign country, and they had two close calls in a week. I told her to be careful after the first one, but when she posted online about it happening again I immediately asked if she was alright, and she said she was, then ranted in a group chat while drunk. A gay member made jokes at the expense of the guys who tried to touch her, while also making edgy jokes about being stoned in Qatar, and she muted him. He asked if I could unmute him and I did when she was done talking and she flipped out at me. I asked if she could sleep on it and assumed she was drunk, but she woke up still trying to argue. I hadn't slept on it yet and wanted to wait but she pressured me into talking, and I asked why she talked to him knowing he's edgy and she equated it to someone asking an SA victim ""what were you wearing?"" I told her I was sorry but struggling to balance giving her space and independence (as a friend now) versus looking out for her wellbeing, and she called me manipulative and I said she'd lost her way and wanted to stop talking.  
  
About two months later, when I moved for school, I got nostalgic for her because the long drives reminded me of driving out to see her on weekends. I was reminded of a mutual friend of ours who mentioned crashing out at a girl over a situationship where they both had crushes on each other but never asked the other out, and it made me feel bad about how I cut her off. This person then posted semi-lewd art she drew of them, so I assumed they were dating and asked what was up. I was originally going to warn him about the way she treated me, but he said they weren't and I just thought about how I acted. I was not perfect in this. It takes two to tango and I argued often too. I didn't always agree to disagree, with the fight over her ex's friend being a case when I was persistent because I thought she was being unfair and it was unbecoming of a public servant. I cut her off after she wanted to talk again. I emotionally shut down living with my mother, who is abusive, emotionally immature, and neglectful of animals, and wasn't fully present for her. I tried to be the bigger person or stoic, but this led to me not being affectionate enough. I also think I would go between clingy to demanding space, although I stopped being as clingy because I recognized the disconnect was unhealthy but I'd also always expect to talk over any arguments. A wave of regret fell over me as I went to her dream college we planned on attending together. I discussed with a few people if I should reach out to her again and decided to.  
  
I apologized for these things, She was very angry and it seemed like I just validated how she felt. A few days later, she admitted she was dating my mutual, which I didn't have a problem with. I just wanted my feelings validated and I asked if she felt like she was ready for another relationship. She tried to date one other person and implied she sexted or slept with another friend or hers, so it seemed like she was rebounding incredibly hard. She then said she did nothing wrong except for being a lot for me and just yelled at me again, so I just told her to get help and left. I asked why she couldn't talk constructively about her emotions. She always said I was completely unemotional, and I'd said that I tried to be more objective, but this was because I had no space to be emotional because of her and my homelife. She would experience her emotions but was lead by them and would justify how she felt, not ever consider how others felt or if they were healthy. Your emotions can be valid but not your actions. I made a snide comment and we stopped talking for good. She kept blaming and comparing me to her ex, even though my biggest issues in the relationship were the least of his and I didn't do it to degrade her for her appearance, gender, race, etc. like he did. She would also say she wished she'd stuck with her old friend who tried to k\*ll herself in front of my ex because she chose me over this friend.  
  
Our mutual also cut me off and they are admittedly very similar people, alongside their flaws. He is hyper sexual, we caught him liking femboys on Instagram and he would send me Asian thirst traps (my ex is Asian). I don't have anything against him and I really wasn't looking to get back with her. I didn't want to hurt someone in the same way I hurt her, which I did. I'm feeling better but left so confused and aimless. I know none of this is healthy, but part of me wants to blame myself completely not only for how I acted but also for falling for this and feeling like I can't pick out a good partner or aren't worthy of one. I pity her because it's easier to blame her issues on mental illness, familial issues, trauma, etc. But it's hard not to look at how poorly she behaved and how inconsiderate she was. She kept people she thought were stupid around to feel superior and took out her frustration from home in these twisted power dynamics. It's hard to find balance and purpose from this mess. I am moving back home to be closer with my friends, because I wasn't able to while e-dating, and I haven't been close enough to them for about five years when I should have. I'm hoping to rebuild better then. I would like to know if I was manipulative overall. If it felt like I made myself out to be too good or you have any questions, feel free to ask. I didn't intend to come out looking better, but there were so many little things that built up and made me resentful and I'm not sure if my coping mechanisms were to blame or me subconsciously accepting my relationship was over and I needed to gain the strength to cut it off.  
  
If you could, please play devil's advocate. I feel like I was manipulative in some ways towards the end, namely out of desperation, but I don't want to repeat this and I want to get this nagging feeling out of my head",Relative_Bedroom_530,1760368875.0,1,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o5mnqc/was_i_manipulative_towards_my_ex_be_brutally/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o5mnqc/was_i_manipulative_towards_my_ex_be_brutally/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False

We spoke every single day for 2.5 years. Even when we fell out we spoke every single day. It‚Äôs been okay for me this last week (since he left me) dealing with it bc he quite literally said he didn‚Äôt want to be with me anymore, the spark died and the feelings were gone so it‚Äôs easy to accept that im just not wanted but looking back at these messages I feel so incredibly heartbroken that this what we had for two years and it just wasn‚Äôt enough for him that he fell out of love with me? Nothing ever changed either, I just think we got comfortable and the initial high of the relationship died down which is fairly normal in relationships but I just can‚Äôt believe he was willing to let it go while at the same time saying I was the best girlfriend he could have ever asked for.

1o5mj0o,Ex got into a relationship within a week of breaking up with me,"DO NOT REPOST THIS PLEASE.

I (23F) was in a relationship with my ex (23M) for 3 years, we had a bad break up because he said he has feelings for someone else(19F) who he barely knew for less than 2 months and according to him had started speaking 2 days ago which I had no idea about. Now this girl knew we were in a relationship still chose to pursue him. He claims he didn't cheat on me as he told me he was talking to her and that he had mentally checked out of the relationship a year go. 

We weren't exactly perfect, we had our own issues I'm aware of that. But what hurts the most is that he blamed almost everything on me.
Within a week of our breakup him and his new girl are already posting pictures together, writing stuff like thank you for loving me for a long time, thank you for teaching me loyalty, honesty and security. Don't doubt me because you are the only one in my heart. He reached out to me a couple times after breaking up where it felt like we might get back together, but lo and behold, he flipped the script saying, he was just trying to get information out of me to see if I knew anything about her( a little context- no shade to the girl, but she is a little known for not the right reasons) a lot of friends already tried to warn him. He did tell some people that he isn't sure about her and he feels bad about what went down between us, although his actions say otherwise. Since then they keep posting pictures as if they are meant to be. He recently even met her parents within 2 months of their relationship. 

I'm completely shattered because of this situation and trying to make sense of what is happening. Is this a rebound relationship or are they really in love with each other. Do relationships like these last? Because he left a 3 year old relationship so easily and is now enjoying is life and moving on with someone new as if nothing happened.",Ok_Cupcake0711,1760368586.0,1,1.0,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o5mj0o/ex_got_into_a_relationship_within_a_week_of/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o5mj0o/ex_got_into_a_relationship_within_a_week_of/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o5mgyy,She said she still cares but needs space. I can‚Äôt stop thinking about her,"It‚Äôs been almost 2 months since my girlfriend and I broke up. We were together for over a year, and I truly thought she was ‚Äúthe one.‚Äù She ended things saying she loved me, said she wanted to see us getting married but I wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äúleader‚Äù and felt ‚Äústressed and tired‚Äù and needed space and that I should work on my self. She told me the door wasn‚Äôt closed for the future, that she didn‚Äôt see herself dating anyone else, and that she‚Äôd wait for me while I worked on myself.

She has had a bad past with ex‚Äôs. She has been abused before I never did anything like that to her. I was always there when I tried to give my love as best as possible she has fibromyalgia really bad issues essentially. I was always there to support her through that and her family who she still lives with at 25. I just don‚Äôt know where it all went wrong. 

A few weeks later, I broke no contact and sent her an emotional message about how I was doing ‚Äî church, therapy, sobriety, all of it. She responded with a long text basically saying she was also hurting but needed space, that she was happy I was improving, but that she couldn‚Äôt keep talking for her own mental health. She asked me not to text her again ‚Äúfor a long time.‚Äù She said she also missed me but it didn‚Äôt matter because she grew ‚Äúirritated and bitter‚Äù and that I deserve so much better than her. I don‚Äôt agree. 

I respected it, but I handled the moment badly. Told her I‚Äôd always love her. ‚Äî got emotional, turns out my mom got involved weeks before this and sent her a poem that she interpreted as she meant nothing to me (which made things worse), and I regret it deeply. I‚Äôve been trying to move on since then ‚Äî going to the gym, staying sober (enough I‚Äôve cut out hard liquor & weed), working crazy hours ‚Äî but I still miss her like so much it hurts. She was the only girl I‚Äôve ever loved & first serious relationship. 

She‚Äôs removed me from Snapchat and Facebook but still follows me on Instagram and TikTok. She hasn‚Äôt viewed any of my stories in weeks. I keep wondering if she‚Äôs over me for good or if she‚Äôs just trying to heal.

I know I shouldn‚Äôt reach out again, but I think about her constantly. Everyone tells me this breakup is a blessing and that she wasn‚Äôt right for me. That I changed for her. My personality and my demeanor when I was with her. We never fought. Rarely argued. I just can‚Äôt shake it. I just want to know if there‚Äôs still hope, or if I need to fully let go. 

Last thing I will say is the relationship always felt like it wasn‚Äôt on steady ground if I‚Äôm being completely honest. We actually did in high school eight years later got back together. Two months and into our new relationship she broke up with me for about three hours because her friend told her to do it. moved past that. She completely cut that friend out of her life for me. But since she always told me about all these things I needed to do and improve or she would basically leave me. I was always anxious that She would just leave me one day until it finally happened. I feel like I was very clingy because of it. 

I never post on the hear just kind of watch and read but  feedback would be very much appreciated even if it‚Äôs not what I wanna hear. I don‚Äôt know how to move on. She‚Äôs all I think about.

1o5me3w,My [23M] porn (camsite) addiction ruined my relationship with my gf [20f],"Context

I was introduced to porn around age 10 or 11 and used it excessively, often isolating myself in my room for hours, even when my parents were home. I barely had a social life and spent most of my time online.

In college (at 18), I started paying for camgirls. At one point, around 80% of my money went to them. It got so bad that I‚Äôd find empty bathrooms to watch porn and masturbate for hours. It wrecked my focus, tanked my grades, and played a major role in why I‚Äôm still unemployed since graduating. I‚Äôve tried porn blockers and therapy, but nothing has helped long-term.

I‚Äôve been with my girlfriend for 11 months. Two and a half months in, I told her about my past. When she asked if I still watched porn, I lied and said no. She told me porn was fine, but paying for camgirls would be a dealbreaker. I kept doing it anyway, hiding it because I didn‚Äôt want to lose her.



Recent Situations

One day, she found a screen recording on my phone showing I had visited a cam site. When she confronted me, I lied and said I only looked but didn‚Äôt pay. I even tried to make her feel crazy for accusing me - something I knew was wrong in the moment but was too prideful and embarrassed not to do. I regret it.

Eventually, she found clear evidence that I had paid. I admitted it, and it shattered her. She stormed out, and I felt awful - though if I‚Äôm being honest, part of me was more upset about being caught than what I‚Äôd actually done. Initially when I first used porn or camsites in our relationship I felt bad but with continued use I just became numb to those feelings. Because of that, I had spent months lying to someone who trusted me completely and thought I was the ""perfect person for her"".

When she came back, I told her I understood if she didn‚Äôt want to stay. She had every reason not to - I‚Äôd crossed her boundaries and destroyed her trust. Still, she decided to give me another chance, as long as I was honest moving forward. She warned that if I went back to cam sites again, it would be over.

She would ask if I used or thought about porn or the camsites but I kept lying. A week and a half later, I used cam sites again. She caught me through an email notification, and instead of owning up, I tried to flip it on hr for going through my phone, and I lashed out and told her to shut up. She kicked me out - rightfully so.

I‚Äôve acted terribly every time I got caught. I manipulated, lied, and betrayed someone who loved me. These aren‚Äôt qualities of a boyfriend or even a decent person.

Right now, I don‚Äôt trust myself to be in a relationship. I need to face this addiction and rebuild who I am before I can ever be a good partner. Porn has destroyed my integrity, my focus, and my sense of self - and if I don‚Äôt stop, it‚Äôs going to keep doing so. 

The thing is I have known this. I know porn is destructive, yet I still decide to use it anyway. Today, I used camsites excessively. Even if I possibly or most likely lose the love of my life, I continue to use it anyway. That's fitting.  I really love her. She has been my only form of social interaction. I'm scared of the loneliness to come and how that may potentially make my addiction worse than it already is.



Question:

What does forgiveness even look like in a situation like this, and is it something I should hope for or let go of?

How do I know when it‚Äôs time to stop trying to fix a broken relationship and focus completely on my own recovery?

If she were to forgive me, how could I tell whether getting back together would support healing or just pull me back into the same destructive cycle?



TL;DR:

I‚Äôve been addicted to porn since I was around 10. In college, I started paying for camgirls and wasted most of my money and focus on it. I‚Äôve lied repeatedly to my girlfriend of 11 months about using cam sites, even after promising to stop and being caught multiple times. She‚Äôs finally done with me, and I realize porn has wrecked my integrity, focus, and ability to love honestly. Even knowing how destructive it is, I keep going back. I‚Äôm scared of losing her and being alone, but I also know I need to confront this addiction before I can be a decent partner again.",CozySphinx04,1760368288.0,2,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o5me3w/my_23m_porn_camsite_addiction_ruined_my/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o5me3w/my_23m_porn_camsite_addiction_ruined_my/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o5ma1h,Struggling to process this level of betrayal,"
* Trigger warning: discusses BDSM and abuse* 

I am two months post break up with my fianc√® and I am struggling to process the betrayal that he has unleashed on me. It feels like my life has been turned upside down and I am struggling to navigate a way forward.

I am a 34F and had an abusive relationship prior to this last one. He was incredibly emotionally abusive and manipulative, and this eventually culminated in physical violence. I spent 2.5 years working on myself because I wanted to make sure that I had the self awareness and knowledge to ensure that I was never found myself in that position again. 

Then, seemingly out of nowhere, I was introduced to this incredible man by a mutual friend. He was wonderful; he was attentive, kind and affectionate. It felt like a bit of a whirlwind for the first few months and we fell madly in love. We moved in after 9 months, and engaged at a year. I honestly thought I had found my person and he made me feel so loved. Everyone loved him, he was so funny and adoring- my family thought I‚Äôd finally found ‚Äúmy person‚Äù and he seemed to adore them in return. 

There had been a couple of ‚Äòorange flags‚Äô throughout the relationship, which he explained away. The first was finding sex toys of a BDSM nature in his flat. There was a book of lines for his ‚ÄòMistress‚Äô. When I found them, he told me that his ex had been into it and he‚Äôd found it embarrassing but wanted to please her. He said it was nothing that he wanted with me and that‚Äôs why he‚Äôd not discussed it. I was hurt because we‚Äôd discussed things that we‚Äôd tried etc, but I did understand that the more submissive role (which this was) might be something that he might feel embarrassed about- not that is, but I could understand why he might. 

A few months later; I found a receipt for another items of a similar ilk. This had been purchased during the course of our relationship. He said that his ex had peaked an interest in him and he had bought something, thinking that he could discuss it with me. It wasn‚Äôt an entry level item and i was incredibly angry that he had gone as far to purchase an item without discussion. We discussed some things that he might enjoy, and this was about a more ‚Äòme‚Äô focussed sex life in which his pleasure was delayed. I agreed to this but it never really materialised and we had a good and regular sex life. 

Life continued, and conversations were had and he reassured me that it wasn‚Äôt something that he wanted or needed in his life. 

We got engaged and began planning a wedding. I cannot explain the love I had for him and I had him on a pedestal. 

2 months after we got engaged, I caught him messaging a woman on OF. I was heartbroken and kicked him out of my house. When he returned, he was full of remorse, he explained that he‚Äôd been abused as a child and was struggling to process the trauma that he had been through. He immediately enlisted the help of a therapist and we had a rocky few months- however we had an open phone policy and I could check his bank statements if I wanted. There was constant communication and he was, to my mind, entirely honest and open with me. In around April; he moved to a therapist that worked with another practitioner to do EMDR. He was in the process of booking this and had it lined up to start in September. We had a life full of love and laughter, and from about May, I stopped questioning and I even told him that I trusted him again, and I didn‚Äôt think he would do it again. I‚Äôd had physical prof and constant reassurance, I felt safe. 

In July this year, I was on his laptop to do some wedding admin. I used it regularly for admin and had full access- it was effectively shared. I noticed that the browser history was deleted and that immediately set my nerves on edge. I checked another browser and found one day hadn‚Äôt been deleted and it was obvious he had an X account. I loaded it, everything auto populated and there it was. From May, virtually from the time I told him that I trusted him and didn‚Äôt need to check- he was messaging sex workers. Almost every time that I had left the house, he was doing it. Paying for video calls, phone calls, and sending HUGE sums of money to women in exchange for degradation and humiliation. He was also paying for drinks in pubs- I‚Äôve found out that this is called being a Paypig. The video calls are instructional and got him to hurt himself for pleasure, they also control as to when and if he can finish. He had even been to meet a woman to give her cash in the street and tried to invite her to near our home. After much research and digging, I‚Äôve concluded that he is addicted to Findom and enjoys the Sub/Dom dynamic. 

I confronted him and was initially met by more remorse and crying. It became apparent that the story about the ex girlfriend was false, and in fact, he had purchased these items and written the lines to engage in a transactional relationship with a woman online. He and ex had never explored this. 

He seemed to have a few days of ‚Äòclarity‚Äô and it turns out that virtually everything about him was a lie: no education, could not drive, thus the cars he‚Äôd told me he‚Äôd owned were also a lie. Does not have the health conditions that he had told me about. These lies are to EVERYONE, friends, my family, he‚Äôs even told colleagues! He had spent money put aside for our wedding and had actually taken out credit cards to spend on these women. The total runs into the tens of thousands and he is now in some serious financial difficulty. He also told me that he had a long history of ghosting women, both relationships and women he‚Äôd been dating. It was this massive outpouring of lies and saying he wanted to get better. He swore that his love for me was true. 

It turns out he‚Äôd changed counsellors from the one that knew what he‚Äôd been doing, and got the new one- not for EMDR- it was so they wouldn‚Äôt know. He told her that it was for anxiety and self esteem. So he‚Äôd come in from counselling and let me cuddle him and look after him, he‚Äôd say he‚Äôd discussed childhood abuse. And this was actually a lie because the counsellor didn‚Äôt even know. 

I was blind sided and although I knew in my gut; this was it, I was just in shock. I appreciate reading this people might think ‚Äúhow were you blind sided‚Äù but we just seemed so perfect. We talked so openly about it before this. We were getting married at the end of the year and had been getting so excited. 

After a week of promising to get better and me being angry, he ghosted me too. He left our house one day and never came back. He left me to cancel the whole wedding and I had to pack his things. His family are utterly dismayed, and he now won‚Äôt speak to them either because they won‚Äôt cut contact with me. He has however been posting on instagram and bragging that he‚Äôs got a new flat. He went back to work almost immediately. He was booked onto an intensive residential MH course, but unsurprisingly, he did not go. 

I ended up speaking to his family and he‚Äôs always maintained that there was physical violence in the home and emotional abuse. However, it appears that this was false and was in fact, a ruse to keep me from building a meaningful relationship with them. They obviously knew the truth of his circumstances and he wanted us separate in case they let slip. I‚Äôm starting to think that the childhood sexual abuse was also fabricated because he‚Äôd interwoven it into other lies that he‚Äôd told me. 

Thankfully, I‚Äôve always been independent and my house is my own. And my finances are my own. I had a good life before I met him, and I have a fantastic support network. I know I can get through this. But just at the moment, I feel like I‚Äôm moving in mud. How can I have fallen for this man who was so outwardly loving and caring? But was successful in hiding so much about himself? Everyone keeps saying that it wasn‚Äôt me missing it, because he‚Äôs fooled EVERYONE. But right now, I‚Äôm crying constantly and he‚Äôs back dating and acting like everything is normal. 

I‚Äôve got a counsellor and even she said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm struggling to find the words to understand your betrayal‚Äù.  I know people find that their partners have other families and all sorts, I just can‚Äôt work out how this has happened. 

I don‚Äôt even know what advice I‚Äôm after, just anything to help get me through!

1o5m664,Clean breakup harder to handle than messy? That's how it feels,"Had dated for 5 months, she broke up with me - she was recently single and I was intense romantic. Bumped into each other 6 months later, rekindled and dated for 5 months then went long distance for 2 years (I went abroad to study). During my finals when I was to be coming home she broke up with me for reasons being: fell out of love, we‚Äôd both changed, didn‚Äôt have enough in common anymore, distance (I used to smoke in the evenings when she‚Äôd visit - in hindsight why on earth was I), priorities (my studies and internship taking over). Also she had felt sad in general life contexts but concluded it was due to uncertainty of relationship. 4 months later, I‚Äôve been going to therapy and it‚Äôs been very helpful for bigger picture perspective. I had zoomed in on myself with internal destruction, questioning 'how could you not want to be with me' as opposed to understanding her core reasons. Gave her the requested space but was spending the initial months in denial and questioning every action, my hobbies, lifestyle (not blaming myself anymore). Quit smoking and improved everything else I could (classic) and came back hoping she‚Äôd see that. She was so certain on her feelings and felt better without me. Met up once when I was back and she‚Äôd frequently respond to my emotions with ‚Äòit will pass‚Äô.

I understand the general trend (sorry to generalise) that perhaps women process breakups prior to them happening but it just hurt and is confusing that it could be so certain. I wouldn‚Äôt ask for a messy breakup but such a clean cut one really hurts. Ultimately I‚Äôve learnt that she communicated her reasons above with absolute clarity which I mistook for ambiguity. I‚Äôve learnt to appreciate myself and more so importantly acknowledge in this her as an individual with a chosen life direction and the capability to do whatever is best for her happiness, and that genuinely makes me feel happy knowing she‚Äôs doing what‚Äôs best for her. But there‚Äôs still the duality that I love her and want to be with her.

In times of the past where I‚Äôd questioned our situation with the contextual implications of distance and being mid twenties etc I‚Äôd always concluded yes, this is the person I want to be with and fight for. But now 4 months down the line, I‚Äôm in a new city, trying to just crack on and exist with friends but she‚Äôs on my mind every hour of the day, in my sleep and I‚Äôm habitually looking at socials for any sign whilst simultaneously knowing there never will be one. Not that I'm projecting but my general social media stories she does not see, and I understand that she'd try to make things easier for her by not seeing me which is totally fair but doesn't match the clarity of the breakup on her end. She had communicated concerns of feelings a month prior but we‚Äôd discussed working things through. Then bam, semi-out of the blue breakup.

I‚Äôm posting this to ask the community on experience with breakups that happen so neatly with such clarity of reasons (almost too much to process causing ambiguity internally). We're both emotionally intelligent (her more so than me) and I know she didn't want to hurt me but the certainty and straight end of having my best friend almost makes it worse. There hasn‚Äôt been any mixed signals, only absolute certainty - like all the reasons laid out there and then over a series on sincere/caring but in depth texts and then being told that you‚Äôll be fine with it eventually. ¬†

I'm wanting to reach out and message and apologise for making it about my destruction during the breakup and let her know I appreciate her position and ultimately want her to be happy. I also know this is just me trying to hold onto some connection. But I mean, if I've got the rest of my life to not have a connection with her, I'd rather say the things that might in some way help me process (which I get could be selfish) as opposed to living the rest of my life wanting to have got my peace across. At least my peace now with a much clearer headspace as opposed to when it all happened. There was still so much to learn about each other and grow and things really were not that bad aside from the distance in the grand scheme. It was a very giving, loving and caring relationship with rare disputes and enjoying the same things whilst appreciating our individual interests. I know in general I'm doing healthy things to process the grief and move on but there‚Äôs a duality because as much as it‚Äôs what she wanted, I‚Äôm appreciating that with an earnest heart but knowing it‚Äôs not what I want.¬†",bean-n-cake,1760367817.0,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o5m664/clean_breakup_harder_to_handle_than_messy_thats/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o5m664/clean_breakup_harder_to_handle_than_messy_thats/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o5m29s,A letter you will never read.,"The best mornings were the ones where you'd snuggle with me in bed. The world could be burning, or hell could be frozen, we never cared about the world in that brief moment. 

I was taught to cook with love, but you taught me how it feels to eat with someone you love. After a long, tiring day, the thought of sharing a meal with you kept me from going insane. 

Remember the first time I farted, and before you could utter a word, you farted too! We were laughing for 10 whole minutes! Ah, that's how it feels when you can laugh your guts out without any judgment. 

Yes, I made mistakes. Several, in fact. And you did too! But instead of fighting each other over it, we both fought against it. We tackled our problems together, as if holding your hand could give me enough strength to fight against anything. 

But even with all this, leaves fall and fire goes out. Distance has finally crept in between us. A few kilometers away feels like a continent apart, and I'm left with the ache caused by your absence. 

So, I'm finally letting you go. Not because I stopped loving you, but because I have to start loving myself too.

1o5lzef,I remember,"This day last year I slept in your room. Your eldest cat and I sat by your window. I remember the green and white pillows and your Viking axe tattoo and how detailed you are when you cook food. I remember the sound of your laughter and how warm your hug was. I dare not remember your smell and tears come again. I remember the code to your appartment and the way you would fall asleep deeply and soundly. I remember how peaceful everything felt and how for the first time I could breathe. I remember the light and the way I would walk to pour myself a glass of water and you were everywhere in that place and everywhere in the world. I remember how the music felt with you and how sensitive you were when someone was being made fun of in the movie and we would have to pause for you to take a moment. I remember how you would let me have all the hoodies I wanted because I liked to fall asleep to your smell even when we were apart. I remember how you could not eat cheese ir milk and how you would tease I make the best sandwiches. I remember how you walk, the size of your shoes. I remember how you got the scar on your left eyebrow and how you tried to teach me to ride a bike. I remember your kindness and your softness and all things silent and gentle and warm and how you would reach for me in midaleep and I would pray for hours not to take you away and how much I wanted you to be happy with me and to be healthy and well and find more joy in life and how you would console me and how your hands never left mine. I remember how your fingers rested in mine and how I couls find your eyes smiling back at me. I remember the picture of a young boy with his grandfather and how hard it was for you to speak of him and how hard it was for you to speak and be hurt and believe that you were enough. I remember how I would rest my head on your chest and how much I cried when we first parted and you knew no one has ever had me before you. I remember the plants in your mothers garden and the first time seeing our initials in snow in Norway under that hostel‚Äòs window and how you knew you were memorized only by your initial in my phone. I remember I did not feel like dying every day and drowning in that silence. I remember you, my deer.

1o5lywp,"first love, first breakup‚Ä¶ but we never actually dated","I‚Äôve never made a post like this and I‚Äôm not sure if this is the right subreddit for it so redirect me if necessary. But I (24F) am going through my first breakup of sorts. To me it feels like a real breakup; I had to cut off the first guy I‚Äôve ever fallen in love with. But we never officially dated and it only lasted 5 months so I genuinely am feeling like I‚Äôm crazy for being so upset, and no breakup advice is making me feel better because my situation feels so untraditional. 

I met a guy (24M) on bumble who lives 2ish hours away back in June. I had never even been in a talking/casual dating phase with a man prior because no man I met irl clicked and every other man on the apps made me feel like I was talking to a brick wall. He was like a needle in a haystack. We clicked so well immediately and he was a really strong flirt. The giddiness of it all didn‚Äôt last long though. 

I‚Äôm not going to go into details because I know he uses Reddit and I‚Äôm already nervous writing this; I just am so desperate for someone to help me make sense of this situation. But two weeks in he told me he had a one and a half year old child. There was no mention of a child on his Bumble profile- actually I think he had ‚Äúopen to kids‚Äù on it. So I was taken aback by the dishonesty, but I tried to be empathetic. The crux of it all is his ex hadn‚Äôt moved on and wasn‚Äôt okay with him moving on either. So for this entire 5ish month span, I‚Äôve been a complete secret in his life. She found out he‚Äôd been on the apps and presumably saw our texts as well at the very end of June and didn‚Äôt take it well, but we continued talking after that so he must have covered it up well. 

Now, let me note, this is my first even sort of relationship, so from the outside I know how stupid I sound for staying in this situation. I hope at least one person can understand I was so blinded by my feelings for him and desperate for things to work out that I think I reached a point of full delusion. 

Anyways, after months of hangouts being blown off (we hung out once in August),  days without hearing from him, lying or just generally not being open with me, promising and not delivering, and all the while knowing that I‚Äôm a big secret in his phone, I reached a breaking point. At the end of August, I asked to be friends. It was clear this wasn‚Äôt sustainable but I really did value his companionship when things were good and I care about him deeply. We tried that, and to no one‚Äôs surprise, it didn‚Äôt work. We kept flirting but he also simultaneously got more distant and I was left even more confused. 

Three days ago I texted him saying we shouldn‚Äôt speak at all anymore. I should note that it was triggered after I peeked at his ex‚Äôs socials and saw she had tagged him in a post about weekend plans- the previous weekend during which I hadn‚Äôt heard from him once. So I dug that hole for myself. This was a triggering moment/breaking point for me but it‚Äôs also worth noting that EVERYONE in my life has wanted me to cut him off pretty much since week one. So it clearly is for the best in the long run, but I‚Äôve been doing awfully. I feel like I may have completely fucked up. Like maybe I should have just set stricter friend boundaries instead of calling it. I think I‚Äôm just in a weird spot of feeling the heartbreak of losing my first love, but also reckoning with the fact that I was in love with him but all we had was a situationship at best. I hate that word, but what else is there to call it honestly? 

Also, I know this isn‚Äôt all his fault. He told me he couldn‚Äôt be with anyone publicly and I still stuck around hoping for something I knew deep down wasn‚Äôt happening. That wasn‚Äôt a fair expectation to put on him and it‚Äôs part of the reason it really is probably for the best that it‚Äôs over. This was definitely a huge learning experience for me and it held a mirror to some ways I need to grow and mature going into any future relationship. But who goes into a relationship wanting a lesson instead of a lifetime? Not me. 

I‚Äôm not sure why I‚Äôm coming here really. I‚Äôve been listening to a lot of Smosh Reads Reddit stories to distract myself and I know even in the most unique of situations there‚Äôs usually someone in the comments who can relate. Has anyone else been in a similar situation? Or just has wisdom to help me move on? I‚Äôve started therapy, I journal, I‚Äôve got a circle of close friends and family supporting me, and I‚Äôve restarted antidepressants. But I‚Äôve never felt worse in my life.

I can't think. Not a little bit. Nor can I process the whole break-up. It's not for me. I am a ""routine"" kind of guy. 

I've done a great start, have gone through the whole ""addiction"" phase. I don't need her to be happy. I just miss the affection, the company of a female presence. I can't deny that.

I don't deserve to go through something like that. And it irritates me, it hurts me, that she forgot me like that, and threw away what we had. So easily. But I knew her so well, I just didn't want to accept it. She is a typical ""date-and-ditch"" type of girl, but hides it under a relationship and fake feelings, for her to not get stigmatized (branded). 

I need to stop analyzing her and her actions. Even if she changes, whatever she does, it doesn't affect me or my life anymore. I just want her to stay away. I didn't say some things and I never want to be in a position to say them. I replay the phrase ""what she did to me"", and I know it's wrong. Because someone said to me that ""people don't owe you anything"", and I said that ""expect anything, from anyone"".
I just know what I will do the next time a person like that comes to my life, and how I will handle it. Never again excusing red flags. Because when I saw patterns, I neglected them. And here I am now.

2 months have passed and I am SO. ANGRY. I never want to see her again. Some days I way I want her to see me thrive, see me win. I don't want her to see me at all. And no, I'm not only angry with her. I'm angry with me. Like, GET UP AND FIX YOUR LIFE. NOT FOR HER, FOR YOU. But I know what kind of man I am. I'm so ""colorful"" as a human, I only have good things to do and give, and take. I can't let it get over me. It's inevitable. But I have to let it just enough to remind me who I am, not what she did to me. She just did what she knew. I did exactly the same. What I knew.

1o5kw9n,This breaking up No Contact made me feel even worse than breakup,"As a normal human being i too thought that he might took the decision because of others interference and he took decision in 6 hr with 3 ciggerates (he said), and we met on November last and he took this decision in January itself. The break up reason was different back then, it was something like based on ME (looks, caste, culture and what not), but with time the breakup reason got changed and shifted to blame game.

He starting from Jan - may full of chaotic, ( when u slap someone so hard and it actually hurts them don't expect that they will smile at that moment) this was the entire relationship story of me of 2 years of long distance. How can I chill if someone just don't understand what I'm trying to say, how can I chill if whenever we talk he talks about others like otherpeople, bikes, games, money, etc etc. there is no issue on that but what about we? Our future? And what even we doing ? When i ask him he either gets upset or frustrated so I stopped asking about my intrest, I stopped talking about marriage, I get periods mood swings that was also I was not able to share with him because he gets angry, i was getting anxious because there was 0 emotional support, and after all these I just kept blaming myself.

Ofcourse he broke up and reason was so easy, so fucking easy like someone said I'm not a right person for him and suddenly he realised it in 6 hrs after 2 years, but i broke NC and I got insulted like  never I got, it was something like he sees me as a friend, just casual friend, I mean like no nothing happened between us in those meetings, whatever happened between us it has no meanings or something. My question is how can someone just fall out side of feelings? What do actually feelings mean? And how feelings connected with materialistic things like he started taking me granted after he purchased a new bike as like he got someone new. He was so obsessed with his bike like whenever I ask him for bike ride from his location to his hometown he just didn't include me. And it's not only bike ride it's about everything in every plan I m not involved anywhere.

But I did not get those hints back then, I felt and gut instinct said it.but I was unable to get those feelings back then, I choose to stay because I was afraid of staying alone, and more reason was i don't ever wanted to break his trust on girls and love.

But it's fucking a tough insult for me after breaking no contact and when he said he sees me just "" as friends"" no feelings involved and he was the same person who used to get jealous when someone just ask me something inside office.

1o5k9pp,Use your feelings to help with moving on,"TL/DR: Accept your emotions, Cultivate solutions, ACT upon them!  
  
My moving on process has been eventful. From the end of June to now it was a struggle. There was sparse communication. Harsh and hurtful words exchanged. Two last hook ups. A nasty discard (she initiated that). And a whole lot of begging and pleading that ended in plain old rejection and the typical ""leave me alone, i want my peace"" final words.

I went through every stage of grief, and the fire of loss of purpose (business went under) drove my attachment to that relationship. I needed comfort and support but the instability of my life affected us both. I cant lie, i ended the relationship in June because of inability to resolve conflicts. It crushed me to end it. I loved this girl so much but the relationship was eating up all of my mental capacity. I still love this girl even after everything. 

To the point, I was angry, so i used that to reignite my fitness journey and fell in love with running. I added to my routine and its helped me round out physique.

I was living in anguish, so i started reading writing and going to therapy. I am determined to fix the problems that i caused. I will not continue the cycle of pain, or at least take my contribution to it out.

In conclusion. The ending of this relationship has been a huge motivator and teacher. Accept your feelings. Take responsibility for what you've done. Most importantly, ACT. Do something about your problems. Avoid distractions. Address your needs wants and desires. Be vulnerable. Lyft driving and being genuine was an immense help for me.

1o5k2ya,My first time getting dumped,"This girl had not been treating me well for the longest time, 
Being bad at communicating, being untrustworthy, being dishonest 
And i would notice all these res flags but i would stay, because a part of me actually loved her for the other things since all the bad stuff started happening some time after the relationship started 

But one time she did something that to me, was the final straw. At the moment I didn‚Äôt break up with her but I knew I had to end it. I just wanted to wait till i was in the right mind because i say the wrong things when im angry sometimes 

But that very night she suggested we take a break. A break, ‚Äúyeah from seeing each other‚Äù she said. I agreed after I tried to convince her otherwise 

But she ended saying we are officially over a few days later, but we never really had a proper conversation on her reasons to end it, always had been over the phone

Im hurt, because i loved the girl, not anymore because i had checked out because of some of her behavior. So I thought 

I know i need to have self respect, but it feels like i also need closure. I can‚Äôt go chasing her, trying to have a conversation on why she dumped me making it look like im trying to save the relationship, which im not tryna do.

I have some her things at my place, but I don‚Äôt want to carry them and deliver them to her, she should come and fetch them herself 

Im sorry for sounding passive aggressive 

But what do i do, my first time getting dumbed, how do I cope and move on from her? Delete her pictures? Block her?
I don‚Äôt want to seem petty though

I (28M) ended my relationship about four weeks ago with someone I truly loved. We were together for years, and for a long time I knew things weren‚Äôt right. We were stuck in cycles of guilt, manipulation, and pain. I wasn‚Äôt happy, and I knew I was also making her unhappy.

1o5izij,Evil thought- if someone breaks up with you when you‚Äôve done nothing wrong or does you dirty- tell them it didn‚Äôt affect you much because you were planning to breakup with them anyway (only slickly don‚Äôt make it sounds like it‚Äôs retaliation).,"So, of course I only mean this as a hypothetical & DONT promote it.

It‚Äôs meant for people who really deserve it. 

This especially works well perhaps in my situation, and definitely wouldn‚Äôt apply to all break ups but the person who broke up with me was so evil y empathetic and cruel to me that someone like them would deserve it. 

He broke up with me because he ‚Äòhad to‚Äô because of his ‚Äòdepression‚Äô, tried to manipulate me into thinking he was the good guy and he had to do it  while keeping his foot in the door. 

There was never a confrontation the whole relationship, I was super sweet to him & unconditionally understanding, he knew I never had a boyfriend before then too.

And just 7 weeks later he got a new girlfriend, he posted them kissing all over his social media, taking her to the places he said he would take me & putting weirdly cryptic messages or songs in the video like captioning his post as ‚ÄúI never knew true love before I met you‚Äù, and playing the song ‚Äúdancing with your ghost‚Äù in the background. 

He kept making cryptic posts like this for years. I think me blocking him after I broke up with him bothered him so much- & the way he treated me didn‚Äôt fit into his typical victim complex, he HAD to have my attention back to prove he K still mattered to him & he had control over me, or he had to think I was the bad guy somehow lmao.

During this I was in deep pain, but  what he did after  was deeply and empathetic and hurtful and selfish.  It took me almost 2 years to recover.

The guy also had 9 relationships before me, and six out of nine of them broke up with him. So considering everything it‚Äôs just the perfect thing to say to him,

1o5iqt1,How can I heal after a breakup?,"For context (I started dating at 16), I have been with my girlfriend for 9 years, and one day she decided to end it. I don‚Äôt blame her either. I wasn‚Äôt in the best place mentally, but truthfully, my intentions were always pure. I tried my hardest to support her for 2 years without her worrying about the bills and letting her get whatever she wanted whenever. I got lost in despair while all this was happening, and I tried to vocalize how I felt about certain things she did, but no changes occurred. She says she has been trying to change. But of course, the change never truly happened, and I was okay with it to an extent because I loved her unconditionally.
I never expected anything from her; whether she wanted to go to school or stay home, I would‚Äôve supported her. But now that she has left me, I realize many of my faults. She left mainly because she didn‚Äôt feel like she could communicate with me about how she felt, but she gave subtle hints. However, I‚Äôm too stupid to have realized them. I‚Äôm in denial about the whole thing because now that I know all the issues, I want to fix them all, but she wants to move on with her life. And honestly, I don‚Äôt want that, but I know better than anyone else that a fantastic person like her will be happy regardless. I want her happy, even if it‚Äôs not with me, as painful as it is to type this. But now all I can do is try to heal from it and be a better version of myself, but truthfully, I don‚Äôt know what else to do. I started to go to church, read books, try to learn how to cook, and work out. Honestly, I‚Äôm not a bad-looking person (arrogant, I know), and I‚Äôm getting my finances in a way better shape since the breakup. But no matter what I do or try to do, she comes into my mind because I tried my hardest to improve for her from the beginning. Everything else in my life since the breakup has improved slightly, but my heart feels empty. We have only been separated for over a month, and part of me thinks she might return, but I‚Äôm trying hard to kill that hope. I know her too well. Once she sets her mind on something, she won't change it because she wouldn't have made this choice unless she was sure she needed it. Honestly, I'm the one in the wrong, and I've told her this multiple times, and like they say, because you break the plate and say sorry doesn't mean it will fix it. But I wasn't trying to shy away from my faults; I just wanted her to believe I could've become everything she ever imagined. To put some more things in context, I didn't have the healthiest growing up experiences in my life, so when I got upset, I would get quiet because I hated to yell, but she took it as I hated her for it, even tho she knew why I did what I did. Maybe we were both wrong in our own ways, but I thought it was fine since we got up every day trying to improve. I never expected her to be perfect, even tho in my eyes I thought she was. I wish I were still enough for her. And yeah, I've done a lot of research. I do believe this has to do with being with her so long. I have a codependency with her, but what's wrong with depending on someone you love? And saw the future with? I guess it may be what happens when they decide to leave. Like I said, I've spent the last month at least alone with my thoughts, trying and trying to overcome this, and I'll face the music and say it will take me a long time to heal.

1o5imyh,We can‚Äôt leave eachother alone even after 5 yrs..,"We dated young while both still in highschool, lasted about a year. This was during Covid year when me and him would be stuck at home all day so we‚Äôd end up playing video games together. I wasn‚Äôt super mentally stable at that time due to many factors in my life whether it being depressed, my anger issues etc. There were times I‚Äôd yell at him for simply sucking at the game then not talk to him for a hr+. It wasn‚Äôt that healthy we were very much codependent on eachother for our happiness. He is adopted and even told me at one point he felt closer to me than his adoptive parents ever made me feel. Honestly he was so patient with me to and made me feel seen it‚Äôs never compared to others to this present day. In the end we broke up cause I caught him texting a girl friend of his weird sexual things I couldn‚Äôt tell you word for word it‚Äôs been so long. We both made many mistakes and it was a big fault on both our parts I‚Äôd believe. 

Thing is for a while even though I broke up with him I regretted it quick and tried getting back with him for about 2 years..   even when he had gfs etc I‚Äôd text distasteful things to him saying stuff like I knew he missed me considering he watch my stories while not following eachother stuff like that. In the most recent 3 years I stopped (finally right? Yea ik) I told him I really don‚Äôt wanna be thought as a bitter ex and do want to see him happy so eventually I texted him that and wished him well. But, honestly I can‚Äôt tell you all our events.. he moved to Ireland in the past 3 yrs for college and so a lot of it was more so over the phone. Thing is the past 3 years I‚Äôve been single as I learned I need to be happy being alone and okay with it cause I always struggled. Him on the other hand would randomly text me during his relationships saying he wanted to see my face or missed me. This happened every few months or so, pretty sure he‚Äôs been single for around the past 6 months. Until I recently told him I didn‚Äôt want him contacting anymore cause I was finally trying a relationship again, (he did still contact and I blocked him). 

My most recent relationship only last about a month before we had a mutual breakup. I don‚Äôt miss him nor hate him just wasn‚Äôt gonna work out long term and we could tell early on. Anyways, during that I texted L let‚Äôs call him about a month after the breakup I had. He told me he was back with one of his two ex‚Äôs from the past 5 years, I apologized and was honest about why I was reaching out (Due to the breakup and wanting to catch up) So, we caught up and then we blocked eachother. The thing is with the blocking eachother we always somehow managed to unblock around the same time I guess out of stalking eachother. He did this the other night.. he‚Äôs still with his GF and was telling me how he missed me, I asked if he was happy and why he kept doing this it was unfair to them and ourselves. He admitted he can‚Äôt imagine not being able to talk to me and wants to see me again as we haven‚Äôt seen eachother in person in 5+ yrs. 

In the past before my most recent ex and his gf we agreed in a yr or so due to me doing Military I‚Äôd take a trip to Ireland to see eachother again. I told him basically we can‚Äôt keep doing this and I don‚Äôt wanna feel like a side nor be the reason for his guilt towards how he‚Äôs treating his current gf (basically emotionally cheating) and how unfair it was to her. He agreed said we needed to block eachother again and then we stayed on the phone for about another two hours talking about life trying to avoid the blocking until I finally said bye and did it. Honestly I know it‚Äôs shitty of me for entertaining it, I don‚Äôt think of him daily or anything nor I doubt he does me but it is often.. we‚Äôve admitted never been able to have our connection with other as well it‚Äôs just. I don‚Äôt get why we keep doing this for 5 years now it‚Äôs like false hope. A part of me wants to believe ‚Äúwe will eventually find eachother again‚Äù but it‚Äôs naive. I don‚Äôt hold myself back from current relationships due to him just honestly I don‚Äôt really connect with people in general that easily. 

Idk.. I don‚Äôt know what to think of the situation. I‚Äôm a shitty person for it I feel like, tried growing a lot from it as I‚Äôve learned since him 5 years ago not to be as mean and more patient. Less codependent on any current relationship even. It doesn‚Äôt make me depressed exactly it‚Äôs just sometimes I do hope we can see eachother again in person and finally move on in a sense.. who knows ",Ok_Nebula2019,1760359348.0,3,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o5imyh/we_cant_leave_eachother_alone_even_after_5_yrs/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o5imyh/we_cant_leave_eachother_alone_even_after_5_yrs/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o5imsg,"How do I get over my ""perfect"" ex","Please help I am so lost I have no idea what to do.. Me and my ex (first love) had a breakup a week ago that was due to him feeling guilty the whole relationship for not being able to give me as much love as I deserve (even if he really tried to give all he had it wasn't enough). We ended on good terms and have both been devastated. We said we would keep being friends after a no-contact period (which he didn't want to do at first because he lost the most important person to him so he thought he needed me, but eventually respected my wish.) I told him I was open to starting again maybe in few months, in a year, after he was able to work on himself (thing that he will do since I was able to tell him the cause of his problem). He said he ""really doesn't want me to wait. Yes I have thought about this too but it doesn't work like this :/"".

My problem is because he was so perfect to me that I have very little positive points to try to get over him.. Sadly I'm also thinking it's going to be soo hard to find someone better than him.. he was a top basketball player, med student, tall, with beautiful eyes, he was loved by everyone, athletic, with a hot deep voice, with soft hair, funny, smart, flirty, cute, caring, loved by animals, everything you could want in a man..

1o5ilh8,Breakup right before my birthday,"it‚Äôs my (29F) birthday and my bf(31M) came to visit from Chicago.  He was going to drive me to FL to celebrate my birthday and help me move.  We were in a whole ass long distance relationship - I visit him in Chicago where he‚Äôs from and currently lives, he visits me on the southern coast.

There were possible signs - he struggles with alcoholism and financial issues, he‚Äôs kind of addicted to bl0w and says he has ‚Äúdemons‚Äù and internal struggles but I thought that was related to having a tbi from his time in the marines. Also when I went over to his old house in my current city where we met, he would have nights where he would sit downstairs not coming to bed.  I‚Äôm pornfree so was concerned he was on his phone watching porn even though I‚Äôm a very sexual person and he‚Äôs reassured me that he was pornfree too. So I‚Äôd go downstairs bcs I was waiting for him and he‚Äôd just be down there with his phone on his chest eyes closed maybe pretending to be asleep.

Well a few nights ago after going out with him and a few of his guy friends I see a üî• notification from Snapchat - which he said he deleted - while he was drinking beer in my living room at 5/6am as I was trying to go to bed since he was supposed to drive us 4 hours next day.  This wasn‚Äôt cool because we had an agreement that there was no SC bcs he said SC is where the 403s are at and we were in a relationship.  He said to stop freaking out and the snap was from a guy friend who only communicates via Snapchat. I asked him to open the snap then, which he refused and said he was worried it was a d!ck pic.  Then I looked at him and asked ‚Äúare you gay?‚Äù And he said no.  Then I asked why not show me then, what are you hiding I deserve to know etc.

He looked me in the eyes and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a horrible person and I‚Äôm a piece of shit‚Äù and walked out.  Posted about this to a local awdtsg page and one anonymous commenter said ‚Äúhe‚Äôs been seeing my brother‚Äù like going on dates and stuff. Not sure if that person was truthful but to me this would explain a lot and confirms he‚Äôs gay.  So I drove to my bday destination alone and am celebrating alone and this isn‚Äôt what I had in mind.  I feel really stupid and manipulated and heartbroken.

I fear that I‚Äôve dated a few closeted men in the past and that‚Äôs why I went for a seemingly masculine guy who pursued me obsessively. It is so frustrating and jarring to just lose someone you‚Äôve been texting and talking to every day just like that.

1o5hilq,Why do I miss someone who wasn‚Äôt healthy for me?,"After a 6 months of limbo I finally ended my relationship of 1.5 years. Since breaking up properly I feel so much regret and sadness even though I don‚Äôt think it was a healthy relationship for me.

These are some of the things that were happening that I keep reminding myself. 

1. Within 3-4 months of dating he would pressure me to see him more than I was wanting which quickly turned into it being every night. 

2. He would whinge, get panicky, say ‚Äúwhy‚Äù hundreds of times if we went to bed without having sex. (We were having sex 2-3 times a week) he‚Äôd question me even if he knew I was sick or injured. I started to become anxious going to sleep without having sex in fear of being woken up to him panicking at 2 am. 

3. He didn‚Äôt agree with me having male friends. I slowly stopped seeing those friends of mine because of him believing most guys aren‚Äôt interested in only being friends. I finally did catch up with one a few months back and he talked badly about me to his friends about it and they were all acting like I cheated. 

4. I haven‚Äôt been able to attend an event with his friends since point 3. I have been too anxious to be around people who think badly of me when I haven‚Äôt done the wrong thing by seeing a long term male friend of mine. 

5. He would stay at my house right up until I had to leave for work and would often leave at the same time as me after I explained multiple times to him that I need space to prepare for work. I work in healthcare so I need to gear myself up sometimes and have always liked being with my own thoughts before and after a shift. 

6. He would often lie about things for no reason other than to look good. 

7. Rude about strangers that were larger or who were against the norm.

8. Didn‚Äôt clean up if milk was spilt or his dog made a mess until I encouraged him to.

9. He would talk about wanting all the same future things as me but he wasn‚Äôt actively doing the steps that would make that possible any time soon. I‚Äôm ready to have a family with someone, get married, buy a house. And he‚Äôs coasting. 

10. He wasn‚Äôt working full time. This is maybe why he struggled to give me space. I worked full time hours and quite often overtime. Not because I don‚Äôt have money but because I‚Äôm making sure I can set myself up now for the future instead of being shocked and wishing I worked harder when I was younger. 

For disclaimer we did discuss all these points and he was good in a lot of ways. He is very thoughtful, loving and caring. But I feel like I‚Äôve been his teacher in a lot of ways which was draining.

1o5hhzs,I‚Äôm going to reach out to her just a few days after the breakup,"I know this isn‚Äôt what you‚Äôre ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù to do and give them time. 

Long story short, I got dumped and it was because I wasn‚Äôt emotionally available for her at times. We both still loved each other and said that during the breakup as well. 

The first day I was in denial but slowly started to clear up. I booked a therapy consultation and then a therapy session for the following day. 

On the second day with the therapy session, I did reach out asking to talk things through and she said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we should‚Äù. I understood where she came from, so I just went to therapy. 

Throughout the therapy, I had the urge to just protect myself like I‚Äôve been doing all the time instead of actually letting my emotions flow. I started off like that but within 5 minutes I realized that wasn‚Äôt going to work. If I was going to heal and actually grow up, I was doing it wrong. 

I let my emotions fall and let my guard down. I sobbed a bit, but told my therapist the whole story. I told my therapist how our relationship was like, and what I was feeling like after being dumped. Just talking about it and being vulnerable about it helped, it was something I hadn‚Äôt felt ever. I had never really opened up like that to someone before. 

The following day, I talked to one of my friends, who again I didn‚Äôt really open up to ever (he opens up to me frequently) and there, I opened up to him as well. It felt good, it felt good in being vulnerable and honest with myself and how I was feeling. 

After that I started to realize that I didn‚Äôt do that with her, she felt alone and exhausted in the relationship because of that. I guess I ‚Äúreflected‚Äù on myself and actually looked deep inside myself. 

I wrote a letter, a gigantic one that basically talked about every single one of my emotions and my insecurities. The times I wish I told her my insecurities, the times I wish I told her how I felt instead of making her feel alone emotionally. 

This isn‚Äôt just about so I can try to get back to her, it‚Äôs a mix of closure for me and an apology to her. 

I want to be transparent with the person I cared about and loved, and also know that I tried again. I didn‚Äôt give up on us, I put myself through the discomfort and didn‚Äôt avoid discomfort like I‚Äôve been doing my whole life.

We had a very loving break up chat, where we said we still love each other deeply and that we wish the best for each other. He mentioned that some time apart might clear his mind and did mention a possibility of reconciliation. However, I know that that‚Äôs not something I should hold on to, as many people say that during a break up and end up moving on. I initiated no contact and told him I have to remove him on Instagram as I would be so upset seeing his face everywhere. Part of me also wanted him to feel my absence as he would no longer have access to my life. I told him if he needs anything, I‚Äôm available via text/call and he said if he realises that this was a mistake he will find every way to get me back. It‚Äôs really hard not being able to speak to him, because he‚Äôs the one who would usually get me through tough times. Every night I get the urge to text him, but I know it‚Äôs not good. If he‚Äôs really ever going to change his mind and realize how much I brought to the table, he needs to feel my absence. I guess my question is, have you ever dumped anyone and had the dumpee initiate NC? And how did it feel?

1o5h8bc,My ex broke no contact,"He was very insecure and had personal things going on. He had started to pull away the last two months and then we broke up mutually in July after a 7 month relationship. Then in August he said we could try again and then at the end of August he said that he had too much going on and wasn‚Äôt mentally ready for a relationship again. Now it‚Äôs mid October and he broke no contact. 

He said ‚ÄúHey you probably don't want
to hear from me but over the past week I haven't been able to stop thinking about this time a year ago. You brought me a lot of joy during that time and I'm grateful for all the moments we shared. Since we last spoke I've been working towards being sober and I wanted to reach out and acknowledge the pain i caused you this summer. I let the problems in my life sink me and rather than turning to you for support I lost myself in vices to the point where I didn't recognize myself and my treatment towards you. I was cold, dry and selfish I never imagined myself treating you that way and you didn't deserve that from your partner. As the world goes to shit I found that it's you that I'm concerned about the most. So I hope you're doing well and I'm sorry for letting you down.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt respond. Then a few hours later he sent something again. ‚ÄúIn truth while this time apart has helped me get my head organized there hasn't been a day where I haven't thought about you. I understand if you wish to no longer hear from me or if this ship has sailed but I miss you and hope to have you again in my life in whatever shape or form you may allow.‚Äù

1o5h2dp,Who was wrong?,"I (41F) was in a relationship with my daughter‚Äôs father (42) since 2017, in 2019 he moved in with me.  At that time I was already pregnant with our child.  Our child was born during the peak of COVID in 2020, I worked from home with a newborn and 2 kids from my marriage.  The first year he contributed minimally financially (but I understood and was really trying to help him get on his feet financially after having some financial issues related to his divorce and some medical bills).  At one point in our relationship I added him as an authorized user on some of my credit cards to help build his credit up. I have always been a bit weary of finances due to my upbringing but he assured me that I could trust him and led me to believe he felt responsible for the home he lived in with me and any debts incurred. He‚Äôs not a particularly handy guy nor is he the get your hands dirty kind of guy.  So I found that eventually all of the things that needed to be done, needed to be paid for.  Now I don‚Äôt make a ton of money (100k) but for where I am from, I have done well from myself (of note we are both masters level educated and he claims to earn 120k a year).  I had prided myself on my ability to stand on my own two feet.  There was a lot of tension and arguments over what I felt were unfair levels of contribution to the home- both physically and financially.  Eventually the credit card debt came rolling in, I won‚Äôt lie, I never looked too closely at the statements and figured that daycare was killing us (after 2021 all daycare has been charged to my card).  The amount of $ he contributed monthly was what I believe he could afford and I honestly thought he was responsible with the credit cards.  Well long story short- this year (started in January) he suddenly reduced the amount he was contributing without discussion or anything.  Initially I assumed it was just month or two (he always gets pissy around the new year bc I claim our child on the taxes and he doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair) so I assumed he knows I‚Äôm getting my tax return so that will pay off some of the debt. Then it continued‚Ä¶ in July I booked a vacation (financially responsible no but my kids needed a break and so did I).  Well you know he came on said vacation (and has every other one I paid for).  After vacation the fighting and resentment got worse and I asked him to leave in August (hoping for a separation and maybe he would get his shit together), he came back about a week later agreeing to therapy, etc.  I really wanted him to show some initiative and sent him what he requested to schedule therapy and waited.  September rolled around and nothing- including no financial contribution since July.  I brought it up via text and well let‚Äôs just say I was lambasted about what an awful person I am and how I am all about $.  He left that day‚Ä¶ just up and left.  After sitting down and really looking at the debt it became obvious that the amount of $ he put on the credit cards wasn‚Äôt even covered by his annual contribution to the home- meaning he was living here for free and putting me in debt.  I have attempted to discuss this with him but he really switches it back to me- indicating my spending was the problem and that he ‚Äúshould have kept better track of how his time and $ were spent during his stay here‚Äù.  

Am I wrong?!  Did I have the wrong expectations?  Yes I know I‚Äôm wrong for not looking at the debts sooner but if I‚Äôm being honest life didn‚Äôt really allow time and my mental health hasn‚Äôt been the best and I am responsible for this.",Miss_Shell410,1760354760.0,2,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o5h2dp/who_was_wrong/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o5h2dp/who_was_wrong/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o5ge5t,Why did my ex hide herself and wanted me someone I am not,"I've always been able to internalise my thoughts, deal with them and move... and even share them once I did

You wanted me to be more open but got angry when I spoke the truth to you. 

Because I don't communicate this to you... you are snappy and dismissive of when I try to have simple convo..

This eventually led to you shutting me out for over 3 months and refusing to have a mature conversation because I set boundaries for myself by telling you I didn't appreciate the way you spoke to me.

Fast track to recently, the issue is that I don't communicate in the moment and you don't like that I text you in a civil manner to share how I feel after I've reflected on my thoughts clearly.

The irony of it all is that you recently admitted that you felt like you couldn't be yourself or share your true self with me over this 4 year journey. Three month prior you admitted to holding on to something you blame me for, something I apologized for depsite having no clear memory of it apart from what you claim.

In my previous posts I mentioned the entire situation and I know you will probably want to knee jerk just say leave it but I genuinely want to try and not lose out on the love of my life

It‚Äôs been three days I think since he dumped me

So say you dumped your ex after a lot of fighting and said she must not contact you again, the last texts you said goodbye and she said ‚Äúgoodbye, i hope one day you message me to try again‚Äù and you just like the text. 

Then after a month or a month and a half she updates you like this: 


Hello (name)

I have no intention of stirring anything negative! 


I have exciting news, I am healing from
Surgery!! And moving to (his city) next year !!everythings opening up

I don‚Äôt know how you‚Äôll feel about my message but I wanted to reach out

I‚Äôve been healing and I still hold a lot of love, care and hope for us

I keep thinking about how you thought you were ever replaceable or temporary in anyone‚Äôs life, and that I didn‚Äôt let you be yourself, I am plain sorry for that
This time was so good because it helped me reflect and work on myself 
and I genuinely think you‚Äôre irreplaceable - even though it‚Äôs scary to say that rn

1o5g2y0,My girlfriend broke up with me because I said I feel uncomfortable with her meeting male friends one-on-one,"I‚Äôm not sure if I was in the wrong here, so I‚Äôd like some outside perspective.

My ex wanted to meet up with a guy friend from uni while she was in his city. They hadn‚Äôt spoken for a while, and she was the one who reached out to reconnect. I told her it made me uncomfortable. 

I didn‚Äôt tell her not to go, I just said it doesn‚Äôt really sit right with me.

She told me I was being insecure and controlling, and broke up with me over it.

But here‚Äôs the thing‚Ä¶ this wasn‚Äôt coming out of nowhere.

- One of her best friends is a guy she admitted she and him used to like each other. Something tragic happened in his life, and it brought them closer again.

- Another guy she‚Äôs close with always comments on her posts and even posted a photo of her on his story during a day we weren‚Äôt speaking (due to an argument).

- And then there‚Äôs another man who once confessed he liked her, and later randomly called to invite her to a family event. (When she told me about that, I was honestly surprised she didn‚Äôt think it was a bit odd to keep exploring a friendship with someone who‚Äôs already made his feelings clear. Like, even if she didn‚Äôt mean anything by it, I just thought that kind of awareness matters in a relationship). 

It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt trust her, I do. I just don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs always aware of how certain things look, or how they might make her partner feel.

Because if the shoes were in the other foot I highly doubt this will be tolerated. 

Expressing how it makes something feel isn‚Äôt telling the person what you can or can‚Äôt do. 

There‚Äôs always a choice, but then it‚Äôs up to the other person to decide whether that choice (or a compromise) respects the relationship. I guess I just expected a bit more awareness and respect for boundaries.

Now I‚Äôm left wondering, was I really being controlling, or was I just being honest about something most people would feel uneasy about?

1o5fvu6,Broken up with cause of depression,"So 2 weeks ago I (M 23) got broken up with by my ldr gf (F 21) of a year due to her needing time outside the relationship to fix herself and deal with her trauma. Sorry for the text barf in advance and thank you to anyone who bothers reading it.

Going into the relationship on day 1, I knew she had trauma from a past relationship and from childhood, yet at the start of our relationship everything seemed basically perfect, apart from the occasional down day we had a perfectly loving and caring relationship and I've never been happier. She did express some suicidal tendencies thinking back about not wanting to live past 40 and others about how during exam season if her life hadn't changed in 5 years she'd kill herself. At the time due to her saying she was happy cause of me and not wanting to rock a happy boat I didn't push anything. Which later after finding out more about her past and mental health I took a lot more serious (even though this is anon not gonna say more cause feels like betraying trust)

Everything changed though at the start of August with her birthday. Suddenly she seemed a lot more cold and detached and our conversations seemed less romantic and lovey from her side and she stopped wanting to see me or for me to see her. This is all something she agreed with and she expressed it couldn't stay the same forever and that she was saving it for when we called (they were different too) and that she just hated her life and it wasn't anything to do with me. She also around the time started saying that if she was gonna kill herself she'd break up with me first cause it'd hurt less if it was your ex that killed herself. Unfortunately my dumbass didn't act on any of this due to earlier that month us having our first proper fight where in her books I hurt her on purpose (I told a white lie cause I was uncomfortable with her buying stuff for me due to idk some antiquated notion of chivalry or some bs and had to ask for forgiveness for 2 days before she finally said he would and gave in) and worried that it was cause of me. However after a week of me not getting it through my head and not being able to get over the change I finally dumped it after her saying that if she couldn't reassure me we should break up. 

So I dropped it and accepted that this was just the honeymoon being over and the fact that she had still taken a planned trip to see me despite me offering her the money back and despite the week not being the same as our previous or as intimate due to her catching a cold and not wanting to kiss or anything despite months being away it was an amazing week. I walked away reassured that everything was okay and all of it was just me overthinking and the honeymoon ending.

Jump cut to 3 weeks ago with uni restarting and her losing her part time job and needing to find a new one to pay for her accommodation her mood nosedives. She starts again with the break up if I kill myself talk, starts saying that I need to promise I'll move on if she kills herself and I'm young, that she can breakup whenever she wants to and that she's not free she's in our relationship and apologising for being depressed. This on top of saying she feels out of her skin, not comfortable in it and can't decide on anything. This made me unsure so I asked if she was happy and she said in general no but in the relationship yes. Unfortunately this didn't 100% reassure me so I brought it up again (A move I now regret), which led to her saying we were okay but everything was making her feel funky. I in my own stupidity pushed for that if it was the relationship she could end it cause I wanted her to be happy (something I'm afraid put a seed in her mind and I had only asked really for my own stupid reassurance, I know this is an asshole thing to do and I was worried about her too however previous talks about therapy/medication weren't really received well as ""she made the therapist cry"" and strongly hates pills) 

This led to her saying that she would be always grateful for me and she thinks she might have to end it but needed time to think as keeping someone close while trying to fix herself would be challenging. She said she either wanted to heal herself or give up cause being in the middle was too hard and didn't wanna hurt me and that the thought of dragging someone down with her was burdening and stressful and unfair to that person. Unfortunately I wasnt as supportive receiving all this as I had hoped and it made some of my own insecurities flare and led me to making some unfair accusations like when she admitted that the reason she agreed to be in the relationship when she was hesitant at the start if she could be in one was the hope that I could heal her and I accused her of this just being to heal her and now that I've failed I'm gone. She insisted this wasn't about me multiple times to the point of getting angry I needed so much reassurance and said she was a little hurt when I asked if she was talking to someone new as she was spending more time on socials which she insisted was talking with her mom.

Sadly even though I regained my composure, she sadly said she couldn't forgive or forget what I said cause she never understood people who said things in pain or anger and thought it was a good excuse to take them back. I still regret everything I said. She told me that even if she knew the way to make up for it (which she didn't as she'd never done it before) she wouldn't tell me and if she decides to stay it was her choice to forgive me or not and she would have to live with it. She proceeded to take the next week to think about if she could however I think her mind was made up on the Friday and she used it to distance herself as she stopped saying ""I love you"" as it was too hard and proceeded to barely talk to me and despite my begging not change her mind and that it couldn't be a break as didn't know anything anymore and that if I waited she'd stop caring about me at all. 

Finally after a week she broke up with me as she didn't wanna keep me in limbo or give me false hope, she also couldn't promise she'd come back to me cause she didn't wanna give me false hope or a reason not to move on. She said that she might not cause she's too ashamed. She said she spent the whole week trying to find a way she could manage but she couldn't in any way shape or form and having me around would be worse cause then she'd feel guilty that she's not a good enough gf and hate herself even more than she already does. She pushed me to move on and that she was just 1 girl. She told me she didn't want to do this but she had to and that she hopes I look back fondly the way she does and that she doesn't know maybe we'll come back together and if we're meant to be we will be. I tried asking if I could at least check on her once a month but even that she said no to and said she wants to be alone.

She proceeded to say goodbye even whole I begged her to just say see you later or give future us some chance and said she was ripping the bandage off for us. Needless to say I kept trying to fix us as in my head we still loved each other, she said this hurt her and made it more difficult and asked me to stop and when I couldn't threatened to block me. I backed down with her saying how I made her feel worse and she said she can't and how did I expect it to make her feel happy or unburdened and that it was childish and selfish and I had to grow up. She proceeded to block me or remove me or mute me on everything but whatsapp which she removed all my perms to even see if she read my msg and told me to leave her alone. 

My dumbass obviously broke nc a week later to ask if we're were finished as I wanted like closure ig and the whole ""in the future who knows"" type deal is way too open door for me. She proceeded to tell me again right now we were finished and done and that she doesn't know the future and she thought she made it clear. When I tried asking if that's something she'd want as she had said before, she told me she had answered question like that before, she wasn't gonna reassure me or anything again, she wanted to be left alone and get herself back up and that she didn't need this

Idk why I'm really posting this on reddit and I'm sorry for anyone who actually took the time to read this. I just, I don't know how someone goes from saying you're their everything and soulmates and you're their safe space one week to just a couple weeks later cutting them out of your life completely when you used to spend basically time every single day together. Like I get needing space and a break but I just don't know why it had to be like a case closed get the hell out of my life deal. Like how you can go from calling someone the one person in life you love and the single good thing they have in it and your one pleasure in life and then making it sound like you're some stranger hassling them. I'm not mad at her or anything and I know she didn't plan on this or ask for trauma or depression and is going through it I just don't know what to do. Like I still wanna save us and her and idk I just don't get how she couldn't say she'll come back when she said she was happy in the relationship. Like I know I should leave her alone but I still wanna msg and fight for her and push to be in her life and help her through this but I know I have to respect her wishes. I guess I just want insight from anyone who's partner has broken up with them cause of depression or anyone who's been that depressed partner.

1o5fqve,How do you move on when you thought you would spend the rest of your life with them ?,"I‚Äôm 27 and I was with my ex, who‚Äôs 28, for almost 6 years. We started dating when I was 21, so basically all of my adult life so far has been with him. We went through everything together, from graduating university to starting our first jobs and even buying our apartments. He was my person and I truly thought we‚Äôd spend our lives together.

We broke up about two months ago. He told me he felt like he had fallen out of love and saw me more as a friend. He also said that he had been feeling this way since last summer but didn‚Äôt want to hurt me then because I was going through a tough time. Hearing that was heartbreaking because it meant he had emotionally checked out long before I even realized anything was wrong.

We had issues, like every couple. He didn‚Äôt want children while I did, and he wasn‚Äôt sure about marriage either, though he said he was somewhat open to it. I was also the one who did most of the housework and planning, whether it was dates or simple things around the house. But despite those flaws, I loved him so much. He was everything to me.

Now that we‚Äôre broken up, we‚Äôre not in contact. I‚Äôm pretty sure he‚Äôs already dating someone and I‚Äôm trying really hard not to look, but it‚Äôs difficult. He was part of my life for so long. I planned a future with this man and I still find myself wanting him back, even though I know we wanted different things in life. Part of me keeps hoping he‚Äôll want to reconcile one day, but another part of me knows I need to accept that maybe this is it.

I‚Äôve been trying to focus on myself, meeting friends and getting back into my old hobbies, but it just doesn‚Äôt feel the same. I miss the comfort and the familiarity. I miss what we had, even though I know it wasn‚Äôt perfect. Sometimes I feel like it‚Äôs a blessing in disguise, but other times I just want my old life back.

What hurts the most is thinking that he might change for someone else. He always had commitment issues, so I thought he‚Äôd stay single for a while, but now it seems like he‚Äôs already moved on. It makes me question everything. Did he ever really love me? Was I just wasting my time?

I guess I‚Äôm just looking for advice from anyone who‚Äôs been through something similar. How did you actually move on from someone who felt like home? And how do you stop imagining them changing for someone else?

1o5fkd0,I‚Äôm still stuck on my possibly avoidant ex and can‚Äôt let go.,"For context me M (30) and him (26) are coworkers. I was told months ago that he was checking me out for a month and I never noticed. So over a course of two days at work, I tried to sniff it out and turns out I was right. Gave him my number and the rest was history. 

We went on dates for a month and each date was better than the last, was the first time I‚Äôve gone this slow getting to know someone. At the end of the month, during a date, we admitted that based on our chemistry and how the dates have gone, the logical next step was to take things further. Our sexual chemistry was off the charts. I‚Äôve never had that intense of a chemistry with anyone. 

For August, we enjoyed our relationship, we had great moments, amazing dates etc. he admitted he had a self loathing issue, so I kept boasting him up and how lucky I am to have a guy like him. At the end of August, he broke up with me. He stated that I was ‚Äútoo much‚Äù. Saying the boasting him up caused him to lose the ‚Äúspark‚Äù he felt initially. He also admitted that part of it was because he felt like he didn‚Äôt get to know me. We talked and agreed to ‚Äúredate‚Äù so we could start fresh and he could get to know me better. After 3/4 dates and trying it out, he came to my apartment and said that this is done, and that another coworker he was interested in has now made themselves known and he wanted to explore that. He wanted to remain friends and that depending how the other coworker thing goes and how our friendship goes, he‚Äôll ask me out on a date again. 

It hurt like hell, and still does. Knowing each day at work that I‚Äôm working with an unknown person who basically took him out from under me, and him. I‚Äôve tried to get back on the apps and distract myself from him but I keep getting pulled back to him. We‚Äôre doing great as friends, but in the back of my head I just keep thinking of how we were and what I could‚Äôve done differently. He‚Äôs agreed to a date if the other coworker thing works out. Last night I told him I still wanted to fight for him, even though I might get hurt again. Part of me is now regretting that after thinking it over, but again, for some unexplainable reason, I keep getting pulled to him and I can‚Äôt let go.

1o5fk6u,"My (18F) friend whom I‚Äôve dated before (20M) is acting less like a friend and more like a lover, is this weird?","Hi! So my friend (M20) and I (F18) ended things a little over a month ago. He wasn‚Äôt sure about us and said he had a voice inside his head yelling at him to end things ‚Äî and he also didn‚Äôt feel a strong spark.

Well, we decided to stay in contact and we both agreed that we‚Äôd retry once we are both ready to date again. It‚Äôs been okay so far, we have had mature discussions about our feelings and what we‚Äôd want from the future. Around a week ago, we went to germany to see our favorite band live. He‚Äôs usually my concert buddy and we love live music, especially together. We shared a bed, he held my waist during an act at the concert and held my hand whilst we walked through the city ‚Äî overall we had a great time. 

Yesterday, he slept over and I opened up about my mental health issues (I‚Äôm quite an overthinker and the type to throw themselves off a bridge.. anyways!) and he said how brave he thinks I am and how happy he is that I‚Äôm going to therapy, and gave me a big hug. We cuddled for a bit ‚Äî and for the first time since ending things, he started touching my chest area, first as a joke (we joke like this, judge me)‚Äî but then once he saw I was comfortable with it, he just kept his hand there and we eventually fell asleep like that. We didn‚Äôt have intimacy, haven‚Äôt kissed ‚Äî nothing of that sort, but we do cuddle a lot and he‚Äôs now touchy with me.

Anyway, that leads me to my question; Does this mean anything for us? Or is he just doing that for shits and giggles? I‚Äôm not uncomfortable with it, I like it ‚Äî it‚Äôs just leaving me confused a bit. Do I reject him? Do I let him? Can this affect a potential relationship?

1o5fifa,Was I emotionally abused?,"I (M20) was in a nearly two-year relationship with a woman (F20), and looking back, it really wasn‚Äôt healthy. We argued almost every day, and whenever we disagreed, she would insult me, scream, cry, and sometimes even hit or shove me. I never yelled, lied, or insulted her, but she often said I was the reason she acted that way, that I made her scream or lose control.

She had BPD and was extremely emotional. She would cry over the smallest things, hurt herself, and then blame me for it. Around others she was calm and kind, but with me she was unpredictable, controlling, and harsh. She couldn‚Äôt cope with even the slightest criticism, no matter what it was. It always had to be her way, or things would explode.

One time she got furious just because I listened to metal music, saying it was bad for my health and that she wanted someone happier in the future. She often criticized what I ate, drank, or how I dressed, and got upset whenever I disagreed with her.

At some point I realized it wasn‚Äôt love but control and emotional chaos. Her mother even got involved once and threatened me with the police. I stayed calm and patient the whole time, but nothing ever changed.

I just want to understand if this sounds like emotional abuse or simply a very toxic relationship....

1o5fhwd,A broken concept,"And the morning comes, with the same tragic thoughts,
the same anxiety that has grown familiar.
I am tired, no matter how many hours I sleep.
Memories of you only serve to hurt me.

I dream of you night after night.
I hold you there.
I let you destroy the last shred of my dignity,
until the sun rises.
Then I start all over again.

I wait for the hours to pass, for day to turn to night.
I wait for my heart to finally tell me to let you go,
to forget you and to move on.

Move on where?
Why do you follow me from the shadows, not letting me enjoy the serenity of the time I have with myself? Why...
I don't even ask anymore.
I exist like a broken concept.

With the hope that maybe today is the day you will write.
But I know it's not.
And I know that if you did, you would find me cold,
exactly as you wanted me to become.

Still in love with you but‚Ä¶
Just as you once told me you loved me to the Moon and back,
that's where you'll find me now: on the Moon, far away from you,
looking back at a story obscured by the atmosphere.

And I'll tell you, I would jump from there,
into your arms, towards your face like sculpted marble,
knowing full well I would crash against the corners of your personality,
knowing it would hurt...
But I would jump.

1o5f8mh,Who else thinks like that?,"I think that when someone starts a relationship very quickly after leaving another, they are not really in love, but rather trying to fill a void. It is a way to avoid the grief, silence and loneliness that the breakup leaves. There is no time to process what has been experienced or to rebuild. My friends disagree and say that it has nothing to do with it, that simply when a person arrives it doesn't matter when because if they arrive it is the right person (something like that when you know it, you know it).

 Does anyone else think that these relationships are often more of a distraction than real love?

I hurt you, and I know it. My coldness, my mistakes, and seeking comfort in the wrong places really caused you pain, and I take full responsibility without excuses.

I learned too late that having someone so noble, pure, and loyal is a privilege not everyone deserves.

You were and still are a diamond, and it hurts to have lost you for not seeing it in time. I want to remember the beautiful moments: the excitement of that June 28th, that sleepless night, and your light, which I still hold in my heart.

I truly hope life gives back to you all the good you give, that you publish your poetry, that your career brings you happiness, and that one day you become the incredible mother I know you will be.

1o5euig,Do you get over the unique things you did with your EX?,"I very recently got out of a relationship with my ex of a a year and a half, he showed me a lot of things I never thought I would like or enjoy but I did. Most of them are things you can do alone, or I wouldn't as a solo female like techno clubbing etc. 

I wonder if you ever do find the people you need? Because I have come to realize I enjoy it, not just because I loved him but I do like those things and would want to experience them again.

Everyone I've ever met in my life prior to him and my current friends are not into that stuff and it makes me feel like I wont find my person again, or someone I can do these things with.

I suppose I have always been a relationship person, in a way that I have always preferred doing stuff with a partner rather than friends like gaming, holidays, going out etc. Also finding new friends at this point in my life is rather hard, on top of the fact that I am socially inept when it comes to friends.

For the first few weeks, I was in a state of complete shock. I couldn't comprehend the fact that our relationship was over. After two months I still have moments of denial. It's hard to accept because there was no big fight, no huge issues. Nothing happened. He just up and left one day. 

I honestly have a gut feeling that he will be back again. This isn't the first time he's pushed me away. He's already advertising the fact that he's interested in someone else but he seems suspiciously determined to make this fact public. He can convince himself he's fine all he wants, but I know you can't just forget someone you spent 2 years of your life loving, especially when that person was good to you. The fact that he has to lie to himself and the people around him about me being a horrible partner speaks for itself and tells me everything I need to know about his state of mind.

1o5ero6,How to accept he has moved on.,"TDLR, what are your tips to accept they have moved on to another person and they never chose you? 

I (28F) broke up with my ex (28M) close to 2 months ago. He is currently dating the girl (19F) he had an affair with while dating me and I‚Äôm just always struggling to let go, accept he never chose me and move on. 

While we have been mostly in no contact, I sometimes stalk his socials. When I saw he has removed a post on his instagram (I think a post of us, but not sure because he has a private account) I felt so sick to my stomach and am hurting worse than I thought. My hands are shaking and I can‚Äôt walk. 

I don‚Äôt know how to get over him, even when he hurt me so badly. I know there are elements of a trauma bond but my mind can‚Äôt accept he is gone. I‚Äôm struggling with the reality I was never good enough and I was never his first choice. 

For some context, you can look at my page for more of the story, but we were together 4 years. He cheated on me (with the same girl he is currently dating) and I stupidly went back and that‚Äôs when he was hiding an 8 month affair. 

I chose to walk away because, my heart was shattered and trust completely gone. But it‚Äôs been the hardest thing I‚Äôve gone through and everyday I just can‚Äôt stop crying. I don‚Äôt know when it will get better. And I don‚Äôt know why I feel so worthless. 

For people who have gone through this, or anyone who has advice, how do I just finally accept he didn‚Äôt chose me and chose her instead?

1o5epf1,Is it ever okay to text her?,"For context, she (f19) and I m(19) dated for about a month 5 months ago during the summer before we mutually broke up because she had trauma that she needed to work through while being outside of a relationship. It was my first and only relationship and while she had dated before it was her first time being with somebody mentally and emotionally stable enough to be in a relationship and not take advantage of her. We ended up getting extremely close and attached very quickly to which she ended up apologizing for feeding into the relationship too much before she realized she couldn‚Äôt continue. 

We live about an hour away from each other and met on hinge, and a point of contention from when we were dating was the fact that we go to different colleges about two hours apart.

Basically, I miss her a lot and find myself wishing often that I could still talk to her or know how she is doing as she transferred to a new school shortly after we broke up. I want to text her to find out if she is doing better, and if i‚Äôm being completely honest with myself, to see if she‚Äôs ready for a relationship or even still wants one with me. I recognize this thought is selfish and farfetched though, and don‚Äôt want to do anything that would hurt her recovery or lessen whatever memory or opinion she still has of me. 

Am I too attached still, and did i care about our relationship more than she did? Is it ever okay to contact her and ask how she‚Äôs doing, or would that come across wrong and make her uncomfortable?

1o5eg3h,Ex suddenly broke up with me because I‚Äòm not the one,"My BF broke up with me out of the blue, saying he had a gut feeling that I‚Äôm not the right one for him. This came as a huge shock because he‚Äôs been the most loving and caring partner for over 3 years. He told me he‚Äôs had this feeling for more than a year, but only recently was able to put it into words, and that‚Äôs why he‚Äôs breaking up with me now.

I tend to be more anxiously attached, so I thought I‚Äôd definitely notice if something was wrong, but I didn‚Äôt. I have never felt more secure and loved than with him. That leaves me really confused about how someone can be so loving while secretly doubting the relationship.

I asked him if he could explain what caused this change a year ago, especially since he used to say I was the right one and that was genuine. But he couldn‚Äôt name any reason. He just said I‚Äôm perfect and the most wonderful person he‚Äôs ever known.
So why can‚Äôt we be together then? I honestly don‚Äôt understand.

Has anyone ever experienced something similar?

Could this be caused by some avoidant attachment issues on his side? Could there be another reason he‚Äôs not telling me in order to not hurt my feelings? I‚Äôm 1000% certain that no other woman is involved though.

-i go silent, he‚Äôs frightened me with the door slamming and aggressively flinging his seatbelt. (i also was hurt as a kid.) everything that‚Äôs happening is making me feel scared. 

- he‚Äôs never laid a hand on me, but my brain just can‚Äôt handle aggression.

-the car ride is silent, he keeps trying to talk to me & saying ‚Äúwhat would make me feel better right now‚Ä¶‚Äù & ‚Äúwhat would make me feel seen..‚Äù

-i tell him i want to talk when we‚Äôre home, and that right now i really just want to sit in silence because i feel afraid, (and wanted 2 cry.)

two years.

well, technically, four. 

does it even matter how long you spent in my life now? i just want to stop thinking about you

and i guess you are, i just can't get over you yet  
how do i stop thinking about you all the time? it's been like half a year. my grades have gone to shit. 99% gpa and my class rank, now i can't even push myself to study for more than an hour. i don't know how i haven't failed anything yet with the amount of school i'm missing. finally confessed to my family i've been contemplating suicide 24/7 and they just... 

i love them so much

i really do

they've supported me through everything they just don't believe in therapy which i can understand so, so painfully clearly. 

Still going to arrange for a psychiatrist myself seeing the last three years of attempting to fix myself haven't stopped the thoughts from getting worst. sigh. love/hate the local healthcare system sometimes. at least i can apply for and get it, completely anonymous, free of charge, just i'm so uncertain if my application will even be considered, or i'll just be waitlisted 6 months like google predicted

so wonderful

 i'm tired, so tired, so tired 24/7, but i still can't sleep nowadays unless i'm physically exhausted. i'm not blaming you. none of this is your fault. it's mine. i'm the one who can't fix their depression, who couldn't maintain things, who couldn't express their care in a meaningful way. you were just the straw that broke the camel's back.

or i was? since i'm the reason you got bored of me in the first place. can't remove the concrete fact i broke up with you first. i knew you'd get with someone else, and i'm truly happy you've found someone, who i hope makes you happy.

we broke up in june, just before my birthday.

i should be over you now.

i wish i could get over it

after you broke no contact i really thought we could stay just friends until you told me you got a new girlfriend so *nonchalantly.* i don't understand you. you find the dms i sent to your alt and said you loved me. then you get upset when i say i wish you the best. you said a week ago we can spend the next 3 years working things out. then you randomly ask me if i got a new boyfriend. that our mutual friend is into me (he's not). and finally you just casually bring up the fact you're with someone new.

i promised i'd stay in contact for another year

now i don't know anymore

i try to keep most my promises but what's the point? pandering to my own ego? we're both 16 years old, for fuck's sake. we aren't in a romcon, an anime, a novel. we just didn't work out and we both know it. i just can't extradite you from my mind. you're probably just getting girlfriends for what? fun? attention? 

ah.......it's so unfair

what did i even get out of my relationship with you? you don't even live in the same country as i do. i've called you less than ten times. played games with you a few more. got into a fucking moba game in which i wasted over- i don't even know, how many hours is 500 matches? Do i want to know? i don't even know what your fucking face looks like. yes, i know, i'm goddamn pathethic. i had no friends when i met you, and you've been so, so special to me for the last four years i genuinely want to laugh at myself just reading this post-

sorry for the self indulging vent post

it's really late and i can't fall asleep

i have my finals in a month, 10+ 3h exams

blah blah blah everyone else also has those exams- yes but that doesn't mean it's not stressing me out. this and my dad moving out. parents talking about getting divorced. i may have to move to china, which at this point i wouldn't even mind anymore if it gets me away from screaming. i'm just so frustrated.   
i really tried to stop ruminiating like this so much times. i got into stoicism. i've been working out and doing calisthenics for months. forced myself to socialize more at school, got into a few leadership roles, applied for jobs.  
yes. life is unfair. the fact this year, which i had so much anticipation for, ends up like this, just hurts me so, so much. their relationship just reminds me of what i know, that things don't work out sometimes.

""You're depressed, just accept you won't be happy all the time and do something you'll be proud of at the end of the day!""

Saying that to myself and doing it are entirely different! one day, two days, three days, then i just crash and burn out again? I wish  
i could just go back in time to before i messed everything up

1o5dwao,I know I‚Äôm right but I need to feel supported lmao,"I (25F) have broken up with my ex (34M) in the beginning of August. We were together for a year and a half. Moved in together back in April and talked about getting engaged. The reason I broke up with him was because:
1. I found a screen recorded video of him on facetime with a woman playing with herself and I froze. He told me the video was old and I wanted to believe him. Later that night I found out he adjusted the date and time in his phone and lied/gaslit me the whole day (I justified it as him doing something stupid because he was going through a rough time)
2. We moved in with a friend of his in his basement and we got into a big fight because I told him I wanted to hang out with my friend alone and he followed me to the bar anyways. I went to my moms at the end of the night because I couldn‚Äôt stand being with him I was so angry. The next day we go on a date and I get a text from our roommate telling me he invited a girl over the house and he taped up the window that peeks into our bedroom. He lied ofc and said he was just doing blow with friends. Later so DMed the girl her said he hung with and it came out that he told her I broke up with him and they made out. (at this time i was going through turmoil with my family and couldn‚Äôt go back home)
3. Lastly I‚Äôm having a bad night at work I told him I had a bad feeling he was doing something. He told me he was out with a friend and sent me a photo of the both of them. A week later I bought us kittens for our apartment since we talked about them extensively. He goes to sleep and I feel like I need to go through his phone. I discovered 160 deleted messages between him and his ex of 7 years. And how he told her he couldn‚Äôt deal with my ‚Äúdrama‚Äù and if he could stay over her place instead (while he had my car)

Anyways. Real piece of shit I know. A lot more horrible stuff has happened since the breakup but I‚Äôm not sure how to deal with this:

A mutual of mine I used to hang out with just bumping into bars and such posted a photo of him on her instagram story and I know she had a crush on him while we were together. It freaked me out and I haven‚Äôt been able to sleep knowing while I‚Äôm grieving this relationship he‚Äôs going out with a girl he knows I didn‚Äôt like (He also went and followed two women from my job that he also knows i‚Äôm not a fan of). I just need to know how to cope

TL;DR I broke up with my boyfriend for essentially cheating on me and I was moving on fine until I found out an acquaintance of mine posted a photo of him and now i‚Äôm a wreck ",Leather-Conference59,1760343197.0,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o5dwao/i_know_im_right_but_i_need_to_feel_supported_lmao/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o5dwao/i_know_im_right_but_i_need_to_feel_supported_lmao/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False

Attempting to communicate always ended in him retreating to bed and I would have to go and apologise and soothe him. 
He plays games all day and never helped around the house. 

Now- he was struggling with severe mental health and significant trauma, and I have bipolar
And one day I reached my Wits end and just packed a bag and left, had my friends collect my things and basically ghosted him. 

I feel a lot of guilt around the WAY I left and I seriously miss him.

1o5deq6,I‚Äôm not sad? Is this normal?,"My ex broke up with me yesterday‚Ä¶ extremely fresh, I know. I only cried initially when she shared that she wanted the relationship to end. After that though, I almost felt like, ‚ÄúOkay, cool, now I get to do all the things I wanted to do but couldn‚Äôt.‚Äù 

I think I really revolved my life and daily tasks around our relationship. There were things I had wanted to do for myself but always used my free time to be with her.

1o5d2lu,Ex bf said losing the spark,"Hi I'm 19M and my ex is 19M we met at May i 1st move because i find him interested we started smoothly talking everyday and yapping at each other and getting to know each other.


Fast Forward June we still talking to each other video call also and i started to catch my feelings to him he courted me and i said to him that to be his bf and we become official 4 days of courting lang bilis diba hahaha, i appreciate kasi yung effort nya towards sakin kaya ayun sinagot ko at first sabi nya not into ldr sya but we try.

July and August we still keep each other even though madaming challenges sa ldr sweet sa isat isa everyday from good morning to goodnight quality time sa gabi, we meet at each other 1st meet and 1st date it goes well naman we make sure na may time kami sa isat isa physically, we eat we watch movies even photobooth sobrang saya pa namin both.

Katapusan ng august i can feel something wrong na sa rs namin nag open up naman sya about samin and wala din daw sya balak iend kung anong meron kami, gang sa dumating ang september he said the spark is lost na daw at nahihirapan na sya sa amin at naaawa na sya sakin, it's strange kasi okay pa naman kami bago yung break up so pano nawala yung spark na attract kaba sa iba kaya nawala ganon.

Yun we break up on a random day ng september sobrang sakit for me kasi di manlang ako binigyan ng chance isave kung anong meron kami pero wala nako nagawa eh feelings na yun,after break up we still have contact to each other but di ganon nag uusap,tas ngayon october parang wala lang sakanya yung break up while me grieving sa nangyari samin sya enjoying other presence like i'm nothing lang to him,i found out din na di pala genuine intention gusto parang fubu lang gusto willing pa makipag threesome.

Nakakafrustrate kasi genuine love lang naman gusto mo ibigay sakanya pero di na aappreciate parang ako nag susuffer sa decision nyang di ko ginusto ano yun pag nalaplap mona yung tao palit ulit ng ibang lalaplapin anlala ahh, im sorry kung inexpose kita dito its just sobrang unfair lang for me na im healing na wala akong choice while you parang wala lang yung ginawa mong pag iiwan ganyan ba kayong mga lalaki sabi mo di kita iiwan pero nasaan tayo ngayon, i wanna fight kung anong meron pa tayo pero wala eh ayaw mona.

I just really hope we heal but sana mag heal at mag grow ka at magbago awa nalang sa mga lalaking bottom boi di sila mga laruan para paglaruan mo may mga feelings din yan tao rin sila.

1o5cxha,I don't know how to live life without them,"Sorry first time posting here but I need some genuine advice as my mind can't make sense of everything that is happening. Me (24F) had been with my boyfriend (28M) for 9 months. I moved to a new city for work, met him, and the connection was almost instant, he was the most loving and attentive person I had ever met. When I met him I was in a 6 year long-distance relationship, but hadn't been truly happy because my ex and I did not share many core values and we were not moving in the same direction. That paired with this new person, who showed me that not every guy is the same, made me go back home and break up with my partner, he understood as we were growing distant and it was painful but very amicable. 

A month later I go back and I meet up with the new guy, and he tells me that he is in love with me (after the first day of hanging out he did tell me he thought this was going somewhere but I told him I had a boyfriend at the time), I very happily said that I was as well and we started dating. Everything  was great, he was like a guy you'd see in movies, flowers every month, caring, listening to all my problems. We were discussing living together, marriage all very seriously, we wanted the same future. He had his insecurities, as did I, and I was still processing the big break up of my previous relationship and I was honest to him about that, but he said he wouldn't have wanted to wait that he was glad we started dating. 4 years ago he also got out of a 5 year long relationship so I thought that he was very understanding because of this.

During this time we had some arguments, nothing major. I need a lot of reassurance in a relationship, which I know sometimes was stressful for him because he felt like I was accusing him of something, but I was very conscious of my pattern of behaviors, and made sure to approach the subject calmly. Rather than arguments, for me it was conversation we were having about something that bothered us, and we would solve it that same day.

He took me to his best friends wedding, after dating for 5 months, I met his family, and we got on really well, honestly his family was very sweet and loving I had a great time. Important note though that during this period I saw him hug this girl who was an aqueintance, but she had been rude to me and I got triggered so I made a jealous comment. I then apologized, realized I was bein stupid and didn't talk about it again.

We spent the summer traveling. I took him back to my house to meet my friends and family and it was all great. Truly everyone got on very well with him. We had the most amazing time ever.

Fast forward to now, 9 months into the relationship. It was his birthday recently I made him a surprise birthday party, with some cool gifts and his friends as well. He did act a bit weird during dinner were his friends didn't know if he was happy because he had a bit of a unhappy expression but he kept saying everything was great and he was so greatful. What bothered me the most is this stoicism he had, I am very emotional, especially when I am deeply in love, but he just failed to show emotions often and during arguments he would stay silent instead or responding.

So this week was tough on me, I had some concerns regarding my health and my future and I discussed this with him because it was affecting my mood a lot. He said a lot of things but said 'I will not let you go and you shouldn't let me go either.' Great. We get to Friday were we does something that mildly annoys me, I'm explaining and he is again silent, so I ask him to say something and he says he doesn't know what. So I say fine and put on a movie and we agree to talk about it tomorrow.

The morning comes I want to get the talk over with so we can enjoy our day. He gets weird over it and we start arguing more seriously, and he says that I am dramatic and fishing for attention. To what I say soemthing like 'then why are you with me' (which I now regret very deeply).¬°, and he says 'fine let's break up'. I am in shock, I didn't think he was serious but he very much was. I cry, I beg for another chance, I ask for a reason. We seem to agree that we will try and work it out. We meet the next day to discuss what next steps to take. I say what we need to improve on communication wise, what the solutions are, great. We take a toilet break and he comes back saying he doesn't see the relationship going forward. Anyway I am in shock again, I feel scammed, lied to. Again the crying, the begging, he says 'don't get dramatic thart makes me want to leave you more'. He sees me in this state yet has a weird smirk on his face. He proceeded to tell me that I was too dramatic, I get upset too easily, that I remind him of how his father used to argue with him, that he can't get over the jealous comment I made at the wedding (5 months ago), that we are not meant to be (despite several times discussing how fate brought as together), that he doesn't see in me that girl he used to know, and that I am not as 'pure' as he thought. 

Obviously leave me feeling awful. I feel so guilty, I wish I could've just shut my mouth. I begged him to give me a chance, I know I can change, I know I can stop arguing over small things. It was such a pathetic display, I feel so dumb, but I don't understand how I let it get to this point. He was showing no emotion, like he was a completely different person to the guy that loved me before, he was so cruel and harsh in his ways. And it felt like he was pushing me to get me to act aggressive and insult him, to prove to everyone that I am crazy, but I didn't, I couldn't it. This was the love of my life, I love him more than anything, and I don't know what to without him. I asked for a break because I couldn't process a break up, and we agreed to meet in two weeks but I know nothing will change. But I can't bear the thought of losing him, I don't know what life is without him, everything I have revolved around him, I gave him my all. And now I feel dead inside, like I will never find anyone else. I hate him for the things he said, but I can't help thinking it was all my fault.",idkjustagirl25,1760339449.0,1,0.99,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o5cxha/i_dont_know_how_to_live_life_without_them/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o5cxha/i_dont_know_how_to_live_life_without_them/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False

For 8 months I took you for granted and trust me after all the vile shiyt you have called me and said to me nothing compares with knowing your with some other guy already.
During those 8 months that were so horrible for you and you was accusing me of cheating and trying to find any and all flaws to hold against me I was trying to find a different way to love you through the storms we were creating.i used porn as a coping mechanism for so long and was really embarrassed about that and that's one of the main reasons I hit it from you. It wasn't that I was choosing it over you. Every time that we argued about it and you called me all those names it pushed me away and then after we would make up and you would demand sex out of me and when I couldn't perform because of those things that you said to me were stuck in my head you said that I was choosing porn over you and that's not the case. I'm not making excuses for hiding it or treating you the way I did I'm just trying to let you know the reasons for my behavior and that doesn't excuse them I know this is me owning up to what I've actually did to you. The thought of you with another man absolutely fucking destroys me but I deserve it I should have treated you better when I had you now I have to suffer the consequences of my actions and I want to die so bad right now this is so much pain I'm so very sorry for all that shit I know you hate me I'm sorry that I existed in your life. If I could take it all back including myself and just kept my mouth shut that night I asked your cousin to give you my number I would just so you wouldn't get hurt. You're so perfect I've always told you that and I've always told you that you were my dream girl. I'm sorry that I fell back on my duty as a lover.
I still hold firm when I say I'll never want anybody else for as long as I live if I can't have you. And there's just no replacing you. I hope that you find it in your heart to forgive me for all my wrongdoings.
I'm not asking for a pity party I'm not playing the victim and I know you wanted me out of your life since we broke up and I keep trying to put myself back in your life. You deserve better than me. I hate myself so much for this. I'll never be able to get over you but I know I have to let you go because you don't want me in your life anymore. This is going to be one of the hardest things I've ever picked out in my life I don't know how the fuck I'm going to be able to let you go I wasn't ready for this to end. But I did change. But it was too late. But I did change for you for me too. I'm sorry for all the lies about it I'm sorry for how I was to you.

I do have him blocked everywhere except WhatsApp.

For context: I was in a 5-year relationship with a narcissistic person, who had anger and avoidance issues. Still, I tried not to let that stop me from believing we could make it work. I was cheated on, treated badly, silenced  and through all of it, I thought maybe *I* was the problem, that I needed to change. Until I couldn‚Äôt anymore. I started trying to take care of myself a little, and that‚Äôs when problems began. A year after cheating on me, she said she wasn‚Äôt happy anymore and left. We had been living together for 4 years.

Now the house is empty. Every place has a memory. Vacations without her are unbearable. Even driving is hard. I used to see her as the most amazing, beautiful, and sexy woman. Now that I‚Äôm alone, I don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt have hobbies, because I was focused entirely on the relationship. My friends aren‚Äôt that close anymore because I distanced myself from them. I can‚Äôt sleep properly, can‚Äôt eat normally. It‚Äôs been a month, and it feels like it‚Äôs getting harder. My mind keeps replaying both good and bad memories of her but somehow, I can‚Äôt bring myself to hate her.

Then my seasonal depression started creeping in, I warned her about it she said she understood and that‚Äôd she always be there for me and she understood. She also struggled with depression and anxiety to the point she was medicated for it. But my depression got worse she did stay for a bit and tried to help me through it, but I could tell it was wearing on her so multiple times I asked her if this is what she truly wanted to try and get her to choose herself and  break up with me. And she assured me she wasn‚Äôt going anywhere and we were soulmates so I really thought this was gonna be different. Then 2 months in we got in an argument cause I was feeling depressed and insecure so I asked her if she was cheating on me and she lost it. We talked it out a little said we needed to sleep on it and figure it out the next day, then next day she broke up with me. I begged and begged she blocked me everything and I pathetically made second accounts and she blocked me again all without saying a word in response.

1o5c9cy,When it‚Äôs time to start having sex again,"Since my separation/breakup from a highly abusive marriage, I have craved human touch and affection so badly. 

For some context, I have read through a lot of content on covert narcissistic abuse and my marriage had all the markers. The silent treatments, the nonstop discard, the lovebombing and degradation, withholding affection, withholding sex, and all the while blaming me for the whole situation in the marriage. 

She eventually used the playbook of the reverse discard, they stick around, but refuse to be part of anything to fix the relationship. I had to make a decision for my own sanity. She then goes around telling our family friends that I discarded her. 

Anyways, after months of being blamed for our dead bedroom and lack of intimacy, while she does nothing to fix it, I asked to open the marriage. However, I knew I couldn‚Äôt feel comfortable meeting other people in that situation. 

I am happy now that we are separated and I can freely meet other people. It‚Äôs not fun trying to meet anyone. Some people I meet have expectations and I am easily irritated and angry. I know that all I am going to offer anyone right now is bland sex, no emotional connection. 

I know it is a selfish place to be. But if you‚Äôve been in a marriage where your empathy and selflessness was weaponized against you, you don‚Äôt come out the same. 

I read some stories here and see people angry that their exes moved on so quickly to other sexual encounters. I wonder sometimes if they were actually having any great sex with that person who has now moved on? I wonder if they didn‚Äôt withhold or weaponize sex and intimacy. I wonder if their partners were not tortured and shamed for wanting sex. 

It‚Äôs easy to play the victim because your partner leaves the relationship and finds another sexual experience immediately. No one talks about the months and years of sexual deprivation some people go through before leaving their relationships. In my case, I realize sex with my ex had become a tool for training me into compliance. Even days when she would become warm and kind would be followed by things she wanted from me. So her warmth was also a tool for control. 

Leaving this person has made it clear to me that I never want to be tied to a partner who can weaponize intimacy or sex. Also, I believe those who move on sexually immediately after breakups or separation need to talk more about their side of things. 

I would like to hear some thoughts. ",Borrowed-Time-27,1760336968.0,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o5c9cy/when_its_time_to_start_having_sex_again/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o5c9cy/when_its_time_to_start_having_sex_again/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False

1o5c1vy,Ex got married a year with his ex after our 7-year long relationship,"I don‚Äôt know if anyone will ever read this but I need to get it off my chest because I am suffering too much and also feeling strong? 

I‚Äôm 29(F) and I decided to seperate from my now ex almost a year ago now. The relationship was deeply emotionally, psychologically and verbally abusive, manipulative, I don‚Äôt want to throw words around but I i would call it was narcissistic abuse. Even though we had the best relationship I‚Äôve had and felt like soul mates, the foundations of the relationship weren‚Äôt strong and I knew I had to get out before I really start to believe I‚Äôm going crazy (he made me feel so). I tried leaving him several times but it was never successful partly because I am/was emotionally weak and so dependent on the breadcrumbs I got from him. But a year ago, I finally did it when he threatened me what he‚Äôd do to me when he comes back home ( I had refused to pick him up from work). Also important thing is that all of this was while I was sponsoring him for a partner visa). We ended the relationship on peaceful terms because we share a dog, and even though I had all the power to refuse being his visa sponsor, the soft kind heart in me felt like I don‚Äôt want to take it all away from him and so he is now a permanent resident. Did I do what felt right? Yes. Do I wish I was less naive/kind and didn‚Äôt give him the visa? Also yes. 

While I was in insta yesterday I stumbled one of our mutual friends post of congratulating my ex and his now wife on their marriage. I saw him in a suit and her as a bride and it‚Äôs like I saw a very very bad nightmare which is actually true. His ex from his teenage years came to Australia and well, they got married. 

Now I know i ‚Äòdodged a bullet‚Äô and he probably did this to run away from healing or trying to improve as a person, and also because no woman in her right mind would want to be treated the way he did. It seems like he settled for what was easy/familiar.

But that doesn‚Äôt make it hurt any less, I feel quite shattered and like it‚Äôs not real, but it is. I have spent the whole year healing, crying, fully exhausted of pain, had the worst of the worst days but also had some nice moments where I was glad to be single. But I also fear I‚Äôll never find anyone again with the same relationship depth I had with my ex. I have suffered every day since the separation (and yes it was my decision) but I had to save and love myself. It‚Äôs so hard to see that while I‚Äôm doing the hard work of healing and trying to rebuild my life, he just brushes it over and gets married to someone he knew in the past. I wouldn‚Äôt be this hurt if he found someone new and married her. But it hurts because if he was going to end up with her anyway, what was the fucking point of our 7 years of relationship. Why did this have to happen to me, it would‚Äôve been better if they were just always together. Anyway, I know I‚Äôm strong and this is a big push to help me move on even more and close doors. It‚Äôs just tough because we share custody of our dog and I can‚Äôt really go no contact with him (which would be an absolute dream) because this feels like mental torture. I‚Äôm questioning if in our entire relationship he even truly loved me or did he do this all for the visa and now they are both benefiting from what I did for him. 

Anyway, does anyone have anything positive to say, any similar situations or successful stories that can lift me up. I‚Äôm happy this happened but I just wasn‚Äôt ready to see it. I just feel so so lonely and lost.

1o5bwy0,I [27m] broke up with my gf [24f] over her porn addiction,"I dated her for a little over a year but it got way too much for me. 

I was trying to be nice, make compromises and not be selfish but over time what I thought to be just her preference in media and taste began to look more like a porn addiction so I stopped reciprocating and told her flat out that I think she is a porn addict and that isn‚Äôt healthy for her or our relationship. 

Her porn is romance books and movies. She is obsessed with stories like Twilight and 10 things and 50 shades. I went to see that Nosferatu movie with her one time and she literally disclaimed OH FCK YEAH when they had that odd sex scene with the ghoul at the end. 

I was like‚Ä¶ what the actual f??? I literally got confused and concerned about who I‚Äôm dating. 

She is not interested in anything that doesn‚Äôt have to do with ‚Äúthe dark personality man who falls in love with the flawless female who changes him in a second and proceeds to have slow missionary surrounded by candles‚Äù. 

Needless to say she expected this to be our sex life as well. Me going crazy just because she exists. While I was literally touch deprived for a year. In 13 months I was the only person to take the clothes off the both of us. 

I just stopped doing that and guess what? We stopped having sex. I thought ok maybe she doesn‚Äôt like me anymore or is grossed out by me for some reason. Wasn‚Äôt the case. She started complaining that we don‚Äôt do sex anymore. 

she flipped out because I told her I don‚Äôt like this dynamic, that it isn‚Äôt passion and it rather makes me feel like I‚Äôm a begger for sex which turns me off. 

I ended up breaking up because it all got too much.

1o5boai,When you‚Äôre the only one hanging on,"It‚Äôs been 8 months since my 5 year relationship ended. Long story short we got along really well but we both were not making good progress in our lives so she blindsided me one day saying she wanted to work on herself. Then proceeded to act very cold towards me. 

I‚Äôve been better after the 8 months, but I still think about us daily. In the 8 months she never bothered to reach out in any way shape or form. Except to try to get in contact with my best friend who she met through me. I have broken NC twice since the break up , and as mentioned before I got very cold , short, and far between texts. In contrast the texts she would send my friend had alot more life and personality like the ones we used to share . Thankfully my friend respected my wishes to block her so I have an easier time moving on. I wonder if this coldness is her way of guarding her emotions of if she is just that done with me. 

Worst part about this experience is knowing I‚Äôm the only one bleeding from this. The only one with spiraling thoughts day in and day out. The one dealing with constant reminders of what was.

I believe I‚Äôm wired for non monogamy as I am attracted to many other women, no matter how good I have it in a relationship. I want to act on these desires and I fantasize about other women often despite how good I may have it in a relationship. 

I miss my ex very dearly and really want to get back with her. But I‚Äôm scared I will resent missing opportunity to experience the freedom I crave. I don‚Äôt know what to do. My therapist suggested to give it at least a month of being single to see if it‚Äôs right for me.

1o5b8d3,Talking to my first ex made me realize breaking no contact with my recent one would‚Äôve hurt even more,"I (26M) am going through a breakup right now, and it‚Äôs been rough. Out of nowhere, I decided to reach out to my¬†*first ex*¬†the one I truly loved even though we broke up back in 2022. That breakup was painful and on-and-off for a while, but I eventually healed and forgave her. I still like her as a person, but I don‚Äôt love her anymore.

The recent breakup left me completely alone and emotionally drained. My parents aren‚Äôt well either, and everything just feels heavy. My first ex once told me,¬†*‚ÄúIf you ever go through something really hard, you can reach out to me.‚Äù*¬†So I did.

We ended up talking for around 4 hours. I told her about my life how bad things have been lately and about my breakup. She listened patiently and gave me some advice that, honestly, I already knew deep down. She told me that the girl I was with wasn‚Äôt right for me, that it‚Äôs probably a blessing she left, and that I should focus on moving on. She also said my ex might try to come back one day, but I shouldn‚Äôt entertain it.

It helped hearing that from her someone who once hurt me but now spoke with maturity and kindness. Funny thing is, she‚Äôs getting married soon‚Ä¶ to her¬†*high school ex-boyfriend*.

I don‚Äôt want revenge or anything. It just hurts a bit to see people who did wrong move on so easily and have good lives, while I‚Äôm here feeling broken again.

1o5b2la,two years later and he still send me spiraling,"me and my ex have not spoken for two years. we are no contact, live in different cities most of the time, have different friend groups, and both have partners. i‚Äôve been with my partner for almost 6 months and he has been with his for over a year i believe. 

usually i am fairly good at not devoting any of my energy to his memory and with my new partner have been happy enough to not worry about that. but every time i feel like im in a content place something reminds me of him and sends me spiraling. 

this latest instance may be the worst so far. i actually saw him, for the first time in two years, and his girlfriend at a gas station. in a city we both don‚Äôt live in. while i was traveling somewhere else. a terribly unlucky coincidence i know. 

and it has completely overtaken my mind for the past couple days. it is so frustrating and annoying how all this work i‚Äôve done can be so easily unraveled by one person. i can‚Äôt help but wonder if this cycle is going to go on forever.

1o5azdw,I miss my toxic relationship,"Me and my ex were off and on for give or take the past 3ish years. We met when I was 18 and he was 23. Now I am 22 and he is 27. It has always been a bad relationship, he has substance abuse issues, criminal history, lies, cant hold a job, and a tendency to be violent. I on the other hand am in a very difficult major at a prominent school and work a full time job as well, though I can be extremely sensitive and irrational sometimes. It was a horrible match. It had gotten to a point where my family and friends had to step in to ensure I was not seeing him.. that was around 3 months ago. Since then we have slowly stopped communication. It has now been 2 weeks since we have last been in contact and I think about him constantly. I know it‚Äôs normal to miss someone after a break up but this feeling of dread and no hope wont go away or get better. I keep trying to go about my life and and process everything and rationalize why that relationship was unhealthy and not safe. I have lost more than 10 lbs in two weeks and now weigh a little over 100 lbs because I am so upset I cant eat. I cant sleep either. I feel like I have stockholm syndrome-d myself to him in some weird way. It is so toxic and terrible but the bond I feel with and for him is like no other. If anyone is out there reading my 1am chaotic rambling, please if you have gone through this let me know what got you through it. This is terrible.

She told me about only after I found out from her phone. She says it's my fault because I never treated her right, which I believe is true and now I'm blaming myself for everything.

1o5au3k,i‚Äôve thought of her more than anything for seven weeks straight,"virtually all of my poetry is about her. i feel like a wounded animal unable to be rehabilitated.

i just cannot understand how this could have happened, which is perhaps exacerbating the pain. we never fought once. we planned our entire lives out together. both of our families knew that we intended to marry each other. she met my grandmother and childhood best friend on the same day, telling them both that we were going to get married. and then she broke up with me three days later, for no apparent reason - just that she didn‚Äôt have feelings for me and didn‚Äôt have much of a desire to work on it with me. i had no indication that anything was wrong. she had been sleeping in my bed for an entire month (she apparently lost feelings for me around the time she moved in with me‚Äîa correlation i would‚Äôve loved to explore in therapy) without having feelings for me and i had no idea.

she‚Äôs already seeing someone new. i‚Äôve tried to see other people, but i see her in everyone. it‚Äôs absolutely devastating. i keep holding on to the hope that she‚Äôll realize that this was a mistake and want to come back to me. she always said that i was the perfect boyfriend, the perfect amount of affectionate, and the one she knew she wanted to spend her life with. she prioritized communication (allegedly), so we communicated often, and there was never anything i could‚Äôve done differently.

and then she was gone. suddenly. i can think of nothing but the aching void of where she was, even when my friends have been so good to me to give me every possible distraction and outlet. now that she‚Äôs been completely removed from my life, it feels sometimes that she wasn‚Äôt even real, just some dream, beautiful, absurd, and fleeting. 

i cried myself to sleep two nights ago thinking about her. it‚Äôs been seven weeks. i think of her all the time. the void is perpetual. i feel it acutely. there is nothing left of myself to love. i gave it all to her. she didn‚Äôt want it.

1o5aqb0,Texting with ex again but I have a dilemma,"Hey so my ex and I are texting again for about a week (1.5 months since she broke up with me). Things have been good, I've made her laugh lots, she's maintaining text convos, asking me questions, answering my questions, and we've been talking about shared interest in sports teams. She has asked me twice if I'm dating/ if the person she saw me with was a date (both no). I was talking about a irritation on my neck and she asked for pics and then told me I should get it looked at and was very serious about my health. I still love her, and I think it's obvious she still has some interest in me. 

She mentioned yesterday that she's going on a second date later today and I replied ""a second date sounds nice, I hope you have fun. Just be yourself ‚ò∫Ô∏è"". I was adviced that was the best text I could really send, but I can't help but be afraid that I'm just letting her jump into a relationship without at least making it clear that I'm still interested in her. I'm thinking that if I hear from her about the date good or bad, I might ask to call or meet in person and make it clear that I still like her. But like I'm afraid that by then it will be too late and that it's only going to make her confused and hate me.

1o5aj53,Feeling Guilty and Confused (Yap Session),"So when I (22M) was in high school I had met my ex-gf (21F) through a mutual friend of ours online. We were long distance for the first two years of our relationship as she had lived in TX and I lived in Cali, but during this time period I had frequently flown out to see her and she visited me once. When we first got together we were inseparable, I took nearly a year to get to know her before we started dating and when we did it felt like I was so lucky to be dating who I considered my best friend. But at some point around our two year mark, her grandfather had passed, he was a very prominent figure in her life and this took a toll on her mental health and also caused her to be distant with me, she met a new online friend of hers also around this time (Let‚Äôs call him F). She would frequently play with him till past midnight and started to kind of stray away from me even cancelling date nights/movie but at the time it didn‚Äôt bother me, as I had a lot of trust in her and didnt feel like my best friend/my person would do something like cheating to me, I was also trying to be patient with her and understanding because I understood she was going through a hard time and I was happy she had some sort of outlet that made her happier even if it was gaming with another group of friends. 

Well months later I get a text from him while I‚Äôm on a call with my ex, and it‚Äôs just a simple ‚ÄúYo bro‚Äù. I told my ex at the time happily ‚ÄúHey babe your friend F texted me!‚Äù. But she instantly got nervous over the phone and told me to block him, this caused me to get suspicious and I started to probe more until she started crying and told me how she‚Äôs felt guilty these past couple of months because of something she did (not guilty enough to tell me tho clearly). Anyways, her alibi was ‚ÄúWhen I was hanging with F I realized he talked in a very demeaning way about women, so I started to flirt with him to play with his feelings as some sort of internal leverage‚Äù. She told me one of the things she said and it was sexually suggestive which of course made my stomach sick, I asked her the stupid questions like ‚ÄúDid YOU have feelings for him‚Äù ‚ÄúDid he turn you on in any way when you did this shit‚Äù and to all of that she was insistent sobbing no. She begged for me to block the guy which I did, and then she asked me not to leave her but I‚Äôm not gonna lie, I did start yelling at her because I was frustrated and I told her ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even really know if you deserve another chance when all I‚Äôve done is try to be understanding for you‚Äù. I told her to give me a few days to think about it, and I decided to give her a second chance, one because I still feel like deep down she was my best friend and my lover and I thought people make mistakes in hard moments sometimes, but also while she did have THAT friend group, her primary one was with my friends and I didn‚Äôt want to create drama because I already knew most of my friends would take my side but a modest portion would have taken hers and caused tension, plus I thought at the time I couldn‚Äôt really confirm she cheated, I kept asking what other kind of sexual things she told him to mess with him but she said ‚Äúthat was it‚Äù/‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember‚Äù. I beat myself up for this now but a smart friend of mine asked my why I didn‚Äôt ask the guy for his side of the story before blocking him and honestly I‚Äôm not sure, but knowing my dumb ass I probably just didn‚Äôt think of it in the heat of the moment.

So after reconciling and deciding to stay with her it was honestly kind of hard for me and her. I don‚Äôt think I ever viewed her the same way again even years later no matter how hard I tried I just knew that there‚Äôs a possibility she might have genuinely been lying to me. This built into a form of resentment and we would have various arguments where I would stonewall and stop opening up to her, which was a big change for me as before I would always want to communicate and talk things out with her before the incident with F. I would say things out of pocket like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really know if you even deserved trust after what you did‚Äù and before she‚Äôd get quiet, but after months of constantly begging for me to communicate eventually she broke one day and just yelled at me ‚ÄúI DO DESERVE YOUR TRUST‚Äù and explained how much she‚Äôs done to try and earn it back within the past few months. In that moment I realized to a degree she was right, it‚Äôs awful what she did but I‚Äôm not better if I waste her time in a relationship where I couldn‚Äôt give her healthy communication and just loomed the incident over her head, and it‚Äôs not like I wanted to I just did. But after that day I tried harder and also let go, and to a degree it worked and I communicated nearly like before but my attitude just seemed to not have the same excitement as before when interacting with her, not mad or bored but moreso melancholic? Like i loved her just as much but the image I had of her before just wasn‚Äôt the same, but I knew I still loved her a lot. 

A few months after our two years and we both graduated she was insistent that I move in with her. I told her that I really wanted to focus on schooling and that it would be best for us to both graduate or I could try and get a transfer to a university near her in the next couple of years but both her and her dad started to kind of suggest that I wasn‚Äôt taking my relationship with her seriously. Like I said I knew I loved her and one day in 2023 I didn‚Äôt register for classes for that semester, I quit my job knowing I had a modest amount of money in my account and I moved to Texas for her with nothing but a suitcase full of some of my clothes. I lived with her family for a few months but I did not want to constantly be a burden to them so early when I moved I started to work two jobs as soon as I could. The relationship between me and her was good if not better than before, her parents really helped with that in having us all spend quality time together frequently and in this time I built a good relationship with her family especially her dad. Well 6 months came by and I started to kind of feel that we were overstaying our welcome, or moreso I was but not in a rude way. The agreement was that me and my ex would work hard to save up money during this period to move out in the later half of the year, well we were ready and we found a place to move to but when we started to apply I found out that my ex had saved a total of 90$, while I had saved about 9000$ for us and I was very upset at this. 

This caused an awkward argument where she was crying and her parents got involved with our issue as well and they offered for us to stay longer if we needed to save more. I didn‚Äôt want to be a burden any more so I told them we‚Äôd move and I would pay for it but I told her to promise me she would start saving to help out with rent like we agreed and she kept that promise. We then moved in together which was nice at first, but within a few days her attitude started to change extremely and I started to see a side of her I didn‚Äôt before.

I forgot to add a few months before we moved out together I got a remote job that paid me enough to where I didn‚Äôt have to work two jobs anymore so I quit them both and worked on that. Well one day on my day off my ex had came back from her job and I greeted her warmly at the front door but she started to scream at me like a dog about why certain things weren‚Äôt done around the house and it both shocked and embarrassed me because our walls were thin and our neighbors definitely heard the way she was talking to me, but I told her I would work on being more kept up with chores around the house and that I did. But it never felt enough for her, I would do the kitchen, living room, bathrooms, my office, our bedroom, but if she had to switch out laundry in our washer and dryer she would instantly berate me and say I don‚Äôt do anything. This got old quick as on most of her days off she would do little to nothing except the laundry ever other day but besides that she would be up till late at night playing a video game she really likes, screaming and hollering with her friends online till 4 am. This ALSO got old, as I would ask her on work nights to please keep quiet so I could get some rest until one day she just looked at me and told me in a condescending tone ‚ÄúBabe I need you to understand I‚Äôm GONNA be loud when I play, it‚Äôs just something you‚Äôre gonna have to get used to‚Äù. Mind you before this remark I‚Äôve tried earplugs and even my AirPods with noise cancellation but I could still not sleep right. So me, being petty, and this wasn‚Äôt okay, I said ‚ÄúYeah I don‚Äôt think so‚Äù and since I paid for our WiFi I had the app to manage it on, I turned it off and went to bed. She was very upset at this and drove home that night to her parents house and didn‚Äôt come back till the morning.

When she came back I did apologize but she did too, and I didn‚Äôt do that again because it‚Äôs controlling and disrespectful, and for a time she stopped yelling late at night but started to do it again. Ultimately my solution was at certain nights sleeping in the living room because she just wouldn‚Äôt stop, and I think subconsciously I had an underlying resentment build up with her (according to my therapist) and it began to reflect in the way we interacted. Along with this, she started to not really want to even hang out with me, I mean at all. She would constantly game/stream on her favorite game with her other friend group and whenever I‚Äôd ask to make plans together to go on dates she was always too ‚Äúbusy‚Äù or ‚Äútired‚Äù. Also a year after moving in together she basically ditched OUR friend group and never made time for them either, which is ironic because she would complain to me how she felt they were closer to me than her and I would tell here they likely are because she doesn‚Äôt make time for them either. This begun another thing that caused us to argue frequently and at one point I told her honestly ‚ÄúBabe sometimes it feels like you‚Äôre more of a roommate than my girlfriend we never really go out or talk to each other even when we‚Äôre home sometimes‚Äù. And she told me ‚ÄúOh! Well I‚Äôve never seen it that way because I feel comfortable just knowing you‚Äôre in the same apartment/room as me, it makes me happy, it‚Äôs like a comfortable silence.‚Äù This made me feel extremely guilty and I felt I was being selfish for asking for her time when I know she works hard and also around this time she started to develop medical issues so I felt I should have been more understanding, especially because they started to make her take hormonal drugs and antidepressants. 

So late into last year I began to research ‚Äúwhat should I do if my girlfriend doesn‚Äôt spend time with me as much as i want her to even after asking‚Äù, and almost every response was saying to break up and that we‚Äôre like not compatible. I‚Äôm not afraid to say this made me scared and worried, because I did love this girl, a lot. It was like a giant fear for me to be incompatible with someone I loved this much, this was my best friend, my person, my heart, someone I saw my future with forever, I told myself this was just a rough patch that every relationship goes through and that we‚Äôll overcome it together. So I stopped asking to hang out, but the fighting just kept going. And at times she became not mean but just plain cruel, any times I would open up about my feelings I‚Äôd either get berated or if it was about something she did she‚Äôd always have a way to make me feel like the asshole. For example one time I told her ‚ÄúIt feels like sometimes you don‚Äôt actually love me‚Äù and she would say ‚ÄúDo you know how awful it makes me feel when you say that‚Äù but whenever she would tell me that it feels I don‚Äôt love her, id express concern and reassurance. 

Another thing she did was she made fun of my self harm scars from precious incidents years ago making a credit card joke about them out of nowhere, and when I told her this bothered and hurt me she told me ‚ÄúWell how do you think I felt when I found out you did this stuff? It hurts me too.‚Äù. Which felt guilty for too. Anyways, the arguments didn‚Äôt stop, a lot of crying and making up promising to get better, but in February she just had enough. We got into a big fight and she told me she was done with me, she started packing her stuff and I‚Äôm not gonna act like she did it with ease, she didn‚Äôt. It was hard on both of us and we were both crying, hugging a lot, she asked for one last kiss but I told her that would be playing with my feelings and she respected that. She told me she could say if I wanted but I told her ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve both been fighting and I know it isn‚Äôt easy on you, if this is what you think is best for you then I support you‚Äù. I remember her taking a long while to leave because it was hard for her, then after she did I started to sob, she came back like minutes later telling me she could hear me crying and saying ‚ÄúI can stay if you want‚Äù but I told her no it‚Äôs okay lol. Well she went to her parents house and she texted me the whole night telling me how sorry she is and how I mean so much to her, and that she loves me a lot. And the next day I had work but ended it early because I just felt so sad, and to my surprise she pulled up back to our place and texted me ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs talk I‚Äôm downstairs‚Äù. We went out to eat and she told me she decided not to leave but we had to set some ground rules or it‚Äôs over, with me she wanted me to make sure that I kept consistent with the tasks she wanted done around the house, to stop bringing up previous things she did when she would complain about something I did (which I will not lie was something I did and I understand why it was upsetting), and she also wanted me to go to therapy, she said she was taking it for months as individual therapy, but months before she DID ask for me to go to couples therapy with her but for some reason we just never did. On my end I asked her to stop screaming when we argued and to spend more time with me on dates/at home, which I thought was all I wanted. 

Well when it came to therapy I said we should do couples therapy but she insisted we do individual therapy. She told me I needed to do therapy no later than the summer and I did it in the beginning of June, after finishing a semester of school, and also flying out to see my family which she didn‚Äôt want to come along on. I also before taking therapy started to communicate with her better and also listen to her more, I did my best to keep up with the tasks around the house too and for the most part I did, it did feel like I was always doing the majority of it, but I wanted to just make her happy in hopes our relationship would finally be back to how it used to be. And for the 3 months prior to the breakup, it was working, we didn‚Äôt argue nearly as much she SEEMED happier and I felt happier but something I didn‚Äôt notice is she was beginning to show lack of interest in just any interaction with me towards the last month. 

I should also add, before the breakup I need to bring up she had this friend named ‚ÄúN‚Äù. She met N online 3 years ago on the same game that she always plays and streams on, they were on each others same skill level so they would ‚Äúduo‚Äù together all the time on ranked and became pretty close friends. That‚Äôs all I thought it was because of the fact that, when she first met N he was still in his last year high school and we were both out of it with her graduation just the year before, so I was like there‚Äôs no way she‚Äôd have feelings for him. Well naturally he graduated a year later and they only had a year difference, but their friendship started to become oddly close after N‚Äôs father had died. She had always talked about being there for him in his time of need and I thought she was just being a good friend, but then this past year weird stuff started happening. For example, like I said, sometimes I‚Äôd sleep in the living room when she was being too loud, well on day I came into our room to get ready for work and I saw she fell asleep on FaceTime with him! I was very confused and upset and she was half awake when I woke her up asking what she was doing, but she played it off as she must have fell asleep on accident but something I realize now is if that were the case why did neither of them hang up? 

Another incident was one time I walked into our room to chat with her about a funny TikTok I saw. I noticed at this point she was almost always talking exclusively to N in a separate channel, and never with the rest of their group. Now, before this I have a friend named S who is also a girl, my ex would always ask to check my chats with her and I did so without hesitation because there was nothing to hide. But the ONE time I asked her, she showed me the first recent comments they had in their thread, but when I asked her to scroll up she refused to do so. I remember I just stood there refusing to leave at first, and she looked at me very nervously, there was like a buzzing in my ears and my face got really warm as I felt in that moment that I genuinely believed she was cheating on me, I remember just chuckling shaking my head and being super upset internally, and then she asked me ‚ÄúWhat you think I‚Äôm cheating on you?‚Äù. I said ‚Äúwell that‚Äôs how it seems‚Äù, then walked back to my office. I was so freaked out I knew we didn‚Äôt have the money to end the lease early, I had no home to go to as all my family was in California, I thought maybe I could just sleep in my office and she could have our room until the lease ends, I genuinely felt so lost I didn‚Äôt want to live  with someone who was cheating on me, let alone still be with them. But she came into my office minutes after and said ‚ÄúHey I know how bad that looked but in those chats I was just talking to N about how my mental health has been feeling recently, I didn‚Äôt want to burden you with it because I know you‚Äôre going through your own stuff‚Äù. I was both hurt and relieved, hurt because I‚Äôve told her before even a month before this that if she needs a shoulder to cry on or someone to talk to I‚Äôm always here. But also relieved because I was like ‚ÄúOh okay well atleast she wasn‚Äôt cheating on me‚Äù. (This was before I learned what emotional cheating was, I now know even if she was right and she had just been going to another man to express how she‚Äôs been feeling mentally, that alone and also the secrecy being kept from me of their conversations is also just cheating in general.). 

Anyways, back to the last 3 months, aside from the weird things between her and N it was good. We got along fine but one day I asked her if we were renewing our lease together, because I was still aware enough to the point I knew what we discussed and the deal was if nothing changed before our lease ended, which was in less than two months, we‚Äôd break up. She tells me that she decided she didn‚Äôt want to renew, and honestly to me that was fine as I was mainly concerned about our relationship and I felt the bills we were paying was part of our stress. But then she also said that she thinks we should break up, I asked her at first why because I thought things were going well, but she said ‚ÄúThings WERE improving between us, but just mentally with my medical stuff and the other stress I just feel like I‚Äôve been trying to push a car up a hill.‚Äù. I was trying to be understanding so I told her it‚Äôs okay, I was definitely crying but I just wanted what was best for her. 

She didn‚Äôt cry until her parents came around later that night to help her pack some stuff, once again she was sorry and told me she loved me so much and that she‚Äôs trying hard not to just stay with me and stick with what she thinks is right. I told her it‚Äôs best we just break up and grow from it, I felt like the stress from renting and also our work lives played a big part in our arguing, and that we should just grow to improve ourselves and get back together when we both address our issues. She agreed and was even saying stuff like ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre the one for me and no matter if you move back to California or not i know I‚Äôll find my way back to you‚Äù. Which was sweet, but once again when she drove home that night the first thing she did was FaceTime me, I accepted and talked with her and she asked me if I was upset cause I seemed annoyed and I told her no, but honestly a part of me was a little bit because it just felt like she couldn‚Äôt really make her mind up on whether she genuinely wanted us to be together or not. She talked about growth and how this is better for us but is FaceTiming me the first night.

Well when she first left, she couldn‚Äôt move ALL her stuff because she had to move it in portions, so for the first couple of weeks she did not have access to her computer. During this time she was still calling me babe, would visit me and kiss me and touch me in ways only couples would. So I thought, okay she still feels for me the way I feel for her, we‚Äôll just stay true to each other and work on ourselves then rejoin once things get better. Well, after she got her computer back she started to change and told me ‚ÄúHey I‚Äôm gonna stop calling you babe because I don‚Äôt wanna confuse my heart‚Äù which was fine, but then she started to get more cold and distant. Which was fine for me AT FIRST, but then I began to have a lot of time to think about her and N. I asked her a month after ‚ÄúHey we‚Äôre broken up now, was there something going on between you and N while I was together? I won‚Äôt be mad but I just want to move on‚Äù. She told me hes been really nice to her lately and that she invited him to take my spot on the cruise that her family had planned this year, so I asked calmly ‚ÄúSo you guys are/were talking?‚Äù But she got defensive and said no she doesn‚Äôt have feelings for anyone *right now*. It was definitely weird for me thought because N supposedly had a girlfriend and I don‚Äôt think a gf would be comfortable with their bf going on a cruise with another girl, I didn‚Äôt even know N and my ex knew what each other looked liked. I didn‚Äôt push it but she started to get defensive and say ‚ÄúWhoever I get in a relationship with later on is really none of your business, and if three months from now you or I start talking to someone else you need to respect that‚Äù. I agreed that it ISNT my business who she might be in a relationship with after ours ended, but I was a little hurt she was already thinking about even talking to other people when we just ended our 4 year relationship about a month ago.

Well, my overthinking kept going, and as I said she streams her gaming. And she actually held a tournament the early morning she broke up with me, and I don‚Äôt know why but I felt I would find something if I watched it. And I kind of did, towards the end of the stream she had a 1-on-1 interaction with this N guy and it was suggestive and seemed like there was some weird underlying tension there. Now my ex said I could always call her for reassurance because she still cared about me so I did, and the moment I brought up the video, before I could even say what was in it she immediately cut me off and started crying ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been a relationship with you for 4 years and I can‚Äôt believe you even think I would do something like that do you know how that makes me feel?‚Äù. And I felt really bad because I didn‚Äôt meant to make accusations but moreso wanted clarity and reassurance, but my gut kept telling me something was off and that‚Äôs why I asked. Well I apologized and promised I wouldn‚Äôt ask again, which I didn‚Äôt. 

I felt really guilty and awful during this period, before I asked she had atleast wanted to FaceTime me occasionally and would tell me about her day but after that she told me ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt talk to me unless you genuinely need something from me‚Äù. So I wouldn‚Äôt, I began to reflect a lot during this period but I lived alone for the last two months at my old lease, just me and my cat lol. I kept blaming myself for us ending, I kept saying I should have been better, more caring and attentive. I also messed up because during this period I begged for her back twice, and she would tell me to pull myself together but she also would tell me the reasons she broke up with me and that I let her down, saying I took too long to do therapy, that I just didn‚Äôt care, that I was mean to her and didn‚Äôt care about how she felt, and she brung up both misunderstandings and also stuff I‚Äôve apologize for years ago that I thought we addressed and moved on from. I felt so guilty during this period, I remember one night I just kept walking with no destination until my dad called asking why I was so far away from my apartment, and I just cried talking to him about how I screwed it all up. 

When I begged her back the second time it was the time where she listed off all the stuff I did that failed her, but she also said at the end before walking away from me ‚ÄúListen, I love you but there‚Äôs a bunch of stuff I needed you to do in this relationship and you just don‚Äôt do it.‚Äù. I remember the day after was August 1st, and I had ordered her flowers on National Girlfriends day two weeks in advanced because even though we weren‚Äôt together I wanted to buy her flowers one last time. She called me later that day apologizing for yelling at me the night before, and I remember telling her she doesn‚Äôt have to keep them and she can just throw them away, and that the way she‚Äôs treated me the past month has made me feel like she just resents me and there‚Äôs no point in talking to me if she doesn‚Äôt like me in general, I told her she can just keep it professional and only talk to me about apartment related stuff. She said she does care about me and that she didn‚Äôt mean to be upset and that she does want us to be on good terms, and I guess I took that and also the fact that she said she still loves me as indication we still just wants us to grow but eventually get back together. 

It got to the point where I was getting suicidal thoughts and I felt so alone because my work was remote, and I never got to make friends at my college here because my work schedule was so wild I had to do all my classes online. I felt so isolated and I also missed her so much, I would check her socials to see what she‚Äôs up to, it was so weird not seeing someone I used to live with every day for two years. I noticed every day she was always playing with N, every single day. I felt jealous knowing that even if they were just friends he atleast got to hear her voice, her laugh, and spend time with her while I was just yearning for her. Well I knew the suicidal thoughts had to change so I started resuming therapy wanting to be a better version of myself for me mainly, but also potentially her if we ever got back together.

Therapy has been going well, I think I‚Äôve been more emotionally in touch as I have in a while and I feel like I‚Äôm understanding myself more. I know that there‚Äôs things I want to improve on for both myself but also those I care about and that I had things I should have improved on when we were together. But at the same time, that underlying feeling that something wasn‚Äôt right was just still there. The day our lease officially ended, she texted me more than usual, telling me she‚Äôs feeling very emotional and that she read the card I made for her (I left thank you cards for her and her family on the last day before I left and moved all my stuff to my new apartment). But I remained professional but also kind and endearing, I did have a somewhat guard up with her, because for the past couple weeks before this she would text me and pretend like she actually cared about how I was doing then immediately after I replied redirect the conversation to a question she had about the apartment or something else unrelated to us, I didn‚Äôt appreciate her not being upfront so when she started talking about feeling ‚Äúvery emotional rn‚Äù I just made sure to help her with what she needed but not act overly friendly and concerned and make a fool out of myself because last time I did that she immediately ended the conversation. 

Well, after that she texted me one last picture of our cat and when I responded to it she left me on read. I should also note during this time she was actively avoiding me and I know this because her dad literally told me when he came to pick some stuff up by himself, he thought it to be because she was devastated about everything that happened. Well the last time I DID see her was two weeks before, she came unannounced? I didn‚Äôt even know I had the door unlocked which according to her is how she got in, but she said she came to pick up some stuff, but she stuff she grabbed didn‚Äôt really seem important so I was confused, she came to collect CUPS. I sat in the living room half awake because she came into to my room and woke me up, but I was conscious enough to see she kept looking oddly. She said ‚Äúyou look different‚Äù and I asked ‚Äúin a good way or bad way‚Äù and she chuckled gently and said in a good way, which I couldn‚Äôt tell if it was sarcasm or not but looking at it now probably was. But she looked so nervous and couldn‚Äôt even look me in the eye, and kept saying ‚ÄúI can come another time if you want when you‚Äôre at work‚Äù, and I said no it‚Äôs fine, confused as to why she‚Äôs acting like that. She was quick to leave after checking the apartment, scrutinizing me a bit then thanked me for keeping it organized and cleaned while she was gone and I was like ‚Äúyeah of course‚Äù, then she left all embarrassed and quickly walked off? 

So all this weird behavior, the sudden coldness, and of course the previous events when were tg just kept me overthinking. I asked all of my friends and they all agreed that they think she cheated, I asked my therapist and they didn‚Äôt say that outright but pretty much indicated that to me as well. 

Well, just two weeks after the lease ended I went NC with her to respect her boundaries and also try to work on myself, but I just couldn‚Äôt stop checking her socials, I found out she flew out to NY to go see N. The guy who was just a friend, who she claimed she could never have feelings for, who she swore had a girlfriend. And I found out in a way that confirmed they were being intimate with one another. It made sense after that all of the weird incidents and I felt so stupid and hurt. I was so hurt because I asked her for years to fly out with me back to California to see my family but she never had the time to, but just 2 1/2 months after we broke up she can fly out and go see N in New York. I felt numb for the longest, I thought ‚Äúwell whatever now I know‚Äù and I blocked her on everything she didn‚Äôt already block me on. But as each day comes I feel more and more sad. After she moved back in with her parents she quit her jobs and according to her dad last time we spoke she just games all night and wake up late in the afternoon and kind of repeats the cycle. The last time I saw her she was glowing and looked beautiful, she looked way happier than she did living with me and I was happy at that time for her.

But me after I moved out I shortly got laid off at work a month after. I‚Äôve been working out to lose weight but I feel that‚Äôs the only thing I have going for me. I have no friends or family out here, I‚Äôve been door dashing to try and make ends meet the last two months before I have to move back home. And I found out not all of my credits will transfer for school when I move back.  I‚Äôm currently also job searching for almost all positions that I qualify for but if I don‚Äôt have something decent by the time my 60 day notice is over or if they find another tenant I‚Äôll just be moving back home. Part of me is happy as I can‚Äôt wait to see my family and my friends again as I haven‚Äôt seen them in a long time, but i also feel so sad. I feel hurt that I was betrayed by someone I considered the love of my life, my best friend, and I was planning to propose to her within the next year or so. All of the romantic feelings are gone but I remember each day what she did and I keep trying to make sense of it but I dont understand. 

Also after taking my own therapy and remembering what she would say about her sessions, I found out she very likely lied about going to therapy in the first  place and never actually went because things she said didn‚Äôt add up and after asking another friend in therapy they said she was most definitely lying. I feel guilty, I feel like there are definitely things I could have done better to keep our relationship going strong but I don‚Äôt know why I just didn‚Äôt, maybe if I was more dependable she wouldn‚Äôt have found the need to go to someone else to open up about her feelings. Maybe if I set better boundaries she would have never got this close to him in the first place, because she offered to block him before but I said no because I didn‚Äôt want to be toxic and controlling. And if things just weren‚Äôt working out, I should have been a man and just broken things off last winter when I felt unhappy instead of prolonging this, I just wasted both of ours time and prolonged this draining bond we had. My therapist said I was repressing my own emotions and giving up my needs to try and keep the relationship going, which is likely why I felt resentment build up over time. 

I know they said the cheater is always the one who should be accountable for cheating, but I know I played a part in developing her into the kind of person who would even cheat on me in the first place. I just wish I understood more and was more compatible with her because maybe if I was I wouldn‚Äôt have gotten cheated on but more importantly we‚Äôd still be together. She had acts of kindness and stuff that made it seem like she loved me and it just confuses me and makes me frustrated and sad. I also feel like her life has been great without me whereas mines falling apart and the fact that she‚Äôs literally glowing in happiness without me just shows how much I was draining her mentally. I just feel so guilty and wish I could have been the man she needed but I was never gonna be that, I am who I am and even if I improved my habits and communication I‚Äôll always be me. And she will always be her, I should have never tried to change her and make her feel bad for being who she is. If she didn‚Äôt want to go out that‚Äôs fine I should have made more of an effort to do at-home activities but by the time I did it was too late. I should have made her feel more loved and appreciated, and I should have known how to be gentle. Had I been gentle yet masculine maybe then she would have felt safe opening up to me about her feelings. But I didn‚Äôt and that‚Äôs something I have to live with the rest of my life as a lesson but I just don‚Äôt understand how long this guilt is going to eat me up. Next month would have been our 5 year anniversary and the holidays I would normally spend with her family are gonna be around the corner I‚Äôll just have to spend them alone this time until I get to move back home. I have this resentment and I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs with her or myself, maybe both. I‚Äôve told myself I forgive her because I know I need to let go but I think I‚Äôve been blaming myself more than her for it all. I think I do miss her to a degree because she was the closest person to me for the longest, and she‚Äôs been the person that means the most to me since I was 16, but I know I could never be with her again. My heart and mind wouldn‚Äôt allow it, I just wish I was a better boyfriend because there‚Äôs a possibility that if I was instead of being alone right now I‚Äôd be sleeping in bed cuddled against the person who I loved more than anything, who used to be home to me.

1o5ad3d,My girlfriend (29F) broke up with me (29M) after I told her the truth about my career ‚Äî I panicked and ruined everything.,"We were together for 2.4 years. We met online ‚Äî I was starting my accelerated nursing program, and she was a 3rd-year med student about to begin her 4th. It was a tough time for both of us, especially for her, but we adapted, supported one another, and built a genuine connection. When she matched into her pathology residency, I was so proud of her. I really believed we were growing together ‚Äî late-night study sessions, weekend calls, small gestures, everything.

She‚Äôs now a pathology resident, and I work as an ER tech. Through her residency, I did my best to be supportive ‚Äî bringing her food, studying alongside her, being someone she could lean on when she was exhausted. But through it all, I was hiding something I was ashamed of.

I told her I was a nurse when I wasn‚Äôt. The truth is, I failed out of nursing school twice and was put on a three-year probation before I could reapply. Instead of waiting, I decided to switch paths and pursue dental hygiene. I didn‚Äôt do that because I gave up ‚Äî I did it because I didn‚Äôt want to sit around and do nothing. I didn‚Äôt want her to see me as a bum or someone who‚Äôd rely on her once she became a doctor. I wanted to stand on my own, to contribute, and to make something of myself.

The truth came out unexpectedly. She noticed my hospital role still said ‚ÄúER PCT‚Äù and asked about it. I panicked. It was five days before her board exams ‚Äî one of the most stressful times in her life ‚Äî and I blurted everything out. I didn‚Äôt mean for it to happen then. I know that timing made it ten times worse. She already had so much on her shoulders, and I added betrayal on top of it.

She told me that she had forgiven my past mistakes, but lying was something she couldn‚Äôt move past. That I‚Äôd made things harder for her when she needed calm the most. And she‚Äôs right. I let fear dictate my choices, and it cost me the person who meant the most to me.

I never lied to take advantage of her or to gain anything. I lied because I was scared ‚Äî scared of losing her, scared of being seen as a failure by someone I admired so much. But I realize now that I robbed her of the choice to love me truthfully.

She told me she needs space, and I respect that completely. I‚Äôve been reflecting every day since ‚Äî on honesty, accountability, and how I can grow from this. But I still love and care for her deeply. We connected in a way I‚Äôve never experienced before ‚Äî we were so alike, so genuine ‚Äî and it hurts knowing she probably despises me now.

I‚Äôm not asking for pity, just perspective. Can something like this ever be forgiven with time and growth? Or is it the kind of betrayal that ends things permanently, no matter how real the love was?

**TL;DR:**¬†We met online while I was in nursing school and she was in med school. I failed out, switched to dental hygiene so I could move forward and not rely on her, but lied and told her I was a nurse out of shame. She found out after noticing my hospital role, and I panicked and confessed five days before her board exam. She broke up with me. I still love her deeply, but I don‚Äôt know if something like this can ever be forgiven.",AvailableIncident890,1760330301.0,1,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o5ad3d/my_girlfriend_29f_broke_up_with_me_29m_after_i/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o5ad3d/my_girlfriend_29f_broke_up_with_me_29m_after_i/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False

1o5a1g5,healthy breakups feel worse,"Just recently broke up with my gf, we had 4 years together. It was mutual, and our feelings for each other weren‚Äôt fading away, but we just had very different goals in life, our lives are busy, and our schedules weren‚Äôt matching up as often as we‚Äôd want. We had a deep conversation and the lack of attention and intimacy was hurting both of us, and ruining our focus on our careers. We tried and tried for some type of compromise but we ultimately couldn‚Äôt. My mom is in debt and I want to grow my wealth so I can take care of it, while also being able to provide for my future family which i was hoping would be with her. But that means sacrificing time with her right now, sacrificing attention for her, drier texts, Less to no dates, Etc. 
I was willing to keep holding on, and pushing through, but she couldn‚Äôt handle it and kept getting hurt from the lack of attention. Her love language is attention and intimacy. So I didn‚Äôt want to keep hurting her. I felt it had to end.
It sucks. At least with a toxic breakup, you can cope with the fact that breaking up was the correct decision. But the healthy and mutual breakup I went through is making me doubt if I just made the worst decision in my life. If i didn‚Äôt fight for it enough (even though we had multiple talks about this same issue and we‚Äôve been going in circles about it.). I feel like the regret feeling is so strong with a healthy breakup. I feel like it‚Äôs going to stunt my healing period. The bright side I see is the motivation for me to push through my career even more because I literally lost a relationship over this, I can‚Äôt have it be for nothing. But idk, my mind doesn‚Äôt have the clearance a toxic breakup brought, thing is I obviously don‚Äôt want to have ended on toxic terms with her either. But my previous breakup was toxic, so it felt easier to move on. It just feels tougher to get through this one.

1o5a02l,"Just need a place to put the reasons why it ended. Guilt and heartbreak are consuming me. I broke it off, but I‚Äôm still hurting.","I met my most recent partner (31M) and fell in love very quickly and unexpectedly. He has two children, 10 and 5, with 50% custody. After six months he introduced me to them. I fell in love with them too.

A year and two months later, I ended things as we were discussing next steps. I‚Äôm struggling, bad, with whether I was holding too high an expectation. I miss him deeply. I love him and I don‚Äôt want anyone else.

But. He is irresponsible with money. I do not mind debt, and I was willing to work together to pay it off if we married. But he regularly expressed anxiety about finances, and then spent money impulsively on hobbies. He pursued an associates degree at a for profit school and accrued 17k in debt and did not know how much he had accrued until I insisted he look. He had no idea it was that much. He wanted to continue the degree (he has a decently paying job with no college degree), simply because it would postpone the monthly payment.

He owes 20k on a truck he‚Äôs upside down on. He‚Äôs upside down on his house and it has a lien from the IRS. He‚Äôs borrowed thousands from his 401k. I think the total debt excluding the house is something like 80k between credit cards and these other things. Plus he provides child support to their mother. To his credit he has never been late on that. It is the other things, and the fact that he continues to accrue debt with no real plan to pay it off. Again, debt is not a dealbreaker in itself to me. My family was well off growing up and though I am not connected to them or their resources I am mindful of that and that I have been fortunate in that regard. I would have been fine to marry and live on one of our incomes and be debt free in a year. Or something to that effect. My point is that I was not going to break up with him over debt and poor money choices from the past.

But it was the approach to money and impulsiveness. He didn‚Äôt drive over to my side of town sometimes to conserve money on gas. But then he would buy items for his hobbies (spending multiple hundreds or even a thousand if he found something on FB marketplace he thought was a deal). I defaulted to covering for things we did together because he regularly expressed crushing anxiety and shame over finances. Recently he wept because he was so financially strained he couldn‚Äôt afford flowers for his daughter‚Äôs birthday. I ordered flowers and a cake from Publix for him to pick up. Three days later he got paid, and he called me to tell me he was going to spend 90 dollars on a hobby item. He already had three others of this same item. When I gently suggested he may want to conserve the money for a different experience with the kids or together, or just save it so he didn‚Äôt end up in the position he was in for her birthday, he said this made him feel selfish and he offered to pay me back. I didn‚Äôt want him to pay me back. I was very confused by his choices.

When I brought up finances and offered to cover something nice for him to do for himself or expressed concerns for him (because of his stress levels) it gave him anxiety attacks. So I stopped.

I recently got a job in a better paying field and it was closer to my side of town than his. He asked me if the job was going to put a strain on our weeknights. That made me sad.

Also, his daughter has behavioral trouble at school. Again, not a dealbreaker. I tried to do what I could do to help support him and her when I was around. I watched YouTube videos and took an online class on how to help regulate young children so I could understand better. I read everything I could find on her specific type of speech delay. I advised him for many months to pursue having her evaluated by a professional. Her teachers called a conference because his daughter was biting and scratching and hitting other kids in class. She threw a chair. He seems to blame the little girl‚Äôs mom and said his daughter was having big feelings. The teachers wrote home and were very concerned. But I was a teacher and this feels more like a cry for help from his daughter. That seems really severe. Right? I am not a parent, but I feel like I would be trying to access every resource to get my daughter help. When I brought that up, he became anxious. Anxiety about finances‚ÄîI found a child psychiatrist that took Medicaid and gave him the number. He didn‚Äôt want to make an appointment because he didn‚Äôt want to rock the boat with their mother. I just feel like the little girl needs help and obviously something is very wrong inside her, if she‚Äôs throwing things in school and screaming and biting her teachers.

Sometimes he communicates childishly with their mother. Their mother has borderline personality disorder and she is a bit unstable with her moods. His texts to her feel inflammatory and immature. Once she sent him a text that he didn‚Äôt like and he texted back ‚ÄúHA. ARE YOU SERIOUS.‚Äù To her. also, any time she texted him about something that involved conflict, he had an anxiety attack or felt like it was coming. She gave their son an iPhone and he had a full blown panic attack. He often called me to tell me things his ex said on the verge of a breakdown. I had to help him craft lots of texts to their mom. This was exhausting.

He regularly discussed wanting to have babies with me and sometimes would ask to have one in the middle of intimacy. Sometimes he would ask to remove protection. I really want to be a mother. But if I am seriously considering marriage with a man, shouldn‚Äôt I be concerned for these things? Am I overthinking regular hardships? I know he‚Äôs drowning and struggling. But I want to have a family. I don‚Äôt know that he is mature. I don‚Äôt mind the money or the behavior or the contentious ex. I mind his character and reactions toward those things. We aren‚Äôt children.

Tell me if I‚Äôm too harsh. I have faults too. But is this a pattern? I hve so much guilt and sadness. I just want to build a life with someone I respect as well as love. But God, I wish it was him. My heart hurts. Did I make a mistake?

1o59zs5,Recent break up after a 1 year and 10 month relationship,"Myself (27M) came back home in July after being gone for a 9 months overseas rotation. My now ex (29F) was very understanding of what I was going through and had to fulfill an obligation. While being gone, I was 8 hours ahead of her, the communication, energy, effort was there the entire time while being gone. As I was getting ready to come back home, I noticed she was being short and not reciprocating the same effort as she used too. I haven‚Äôt seen her since leaving last year, I have made the effort in trying to see her every weekend. However, I kept turned away from her because she was ‚Äúbusy‚Äù.  Just this past week, I decided to end things. I didn‚Äôt respond to her texts or anything due to the fact that it‚Äôs been 3 months being back home and almost a year not seeing her, not once did she ever feel excited to see me and make time.

1o59ul6,Should I text or wait for her to text?,"Ok so not sure if you have seen my last post or not but basically she wanted the break. I asked if she wanted no contact and she said no, that she wanted to see each other still and talk still. Obviously it‚Äôs been distant cause she is reflecting still and I‚Äôm growing from it. I texted her 8 days ago now and to summarize I said I‚Äôm sorry that I never really understood you and what you wanted out of me/our relationship. You gave me many opportunities and forgave me for failing to make you feel heard. 

She responded saying that she agreed. She wanted our connection to be deeper and to know each other. She was too tired of begging me for what she wanted (communication)and it hurts that she had to leave before I realized how much it mattered. She said that she needs time to reflect on herself and that she wanted to stay in touch however much is possible and she wanted us to work in the future. 

We chatted a bit but we haven‚Äôt spoken in 5 days now. I planed on reaching out today just asking how her week had been going but I think my intentions/emotions didn‚Äôt allow for a great time.

Like I said she has been distant and I have been the only one to reach out/initiate small conversation since the break (1 month). So just wondering if I should text or if I should just wait for her?

I would voice my opinion and she would blow it off saying don‚Äôt worry about it it‚Äôs fine. July of this year we had come home and the whole house was smelling like a skunk I voiced my opinion then and he pulled a knife on me and got taken away by the cops.

Things were fine for a few months then out of the blue this dude who I had no idea existed shows up apparently he‚Äôs the uncle was brining the drugs into the house and I tried putting my foot down and not wanting him there but she continued to allow it. 3 weeks ago it all came to head gf was at work I was home watching the two younger children all hers not mine and him and his uncle are drinking and stinking up the whole house I called her saying this needs to stop we are going to get evicted and she said it‚Äôs fine don‚Äôt worry and you have somewhere to go if that happens. I said I will make arrangements for the animals to go to new homes Iam leaving I packed my shit and left.

Now that Iam gone now she wants to fix the issues claims the uncle is not coming over anymore mind u this man she stuck up for more then me and our relationship and that the drugs are gone and my number one rule for even moving in from get go there were to be no drugs period but she enabled her son being more of a friend then a mother I came so close my breaking point and losing my shit the night I left it was either I leave peacefully or in cuffs now she won‚Äôt leave me alone begging me to come back claiming the issues are fixed and that she wants to prove that she is 100 percent dedicated to me and even saying she would kick out the 16 year old back to his dads if I came back which I don‚Äôt feel is right I know I made the right choice but dam it really plays hell on you when you spend so much time and effort on someone just to watch it crumble and fall apart and my boundaries and wishes not being respected all the hopes and dreams and potential future just destroyed and the other man the uncle would stay the night all the time even when I was at work so there is no telling if something was going on or not and her claiming to be 100 percent dedicated and the issues fixed why now where was this when we were together now that Iam gone now you want to fix the issues and be 100 percent dedicated I feel very betrayed and let down",ReserveRadiant847,1760328460.0,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o59sol/why_just_why/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o59sol/why_just_why/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False

1o59pv6,Pics of ME on his new Tinder,"Me (M23) and my ex-boyfriend (M24) broke up about two months ago. I decided to finally re-download some apps mostly out of boredom & curiosity. Literally 3 swipes in on tinder and boom there he was. My stomach dropped a little from the surprise but I wasn‚Äôt upset or anything, yet. After all, I‚Äôm on tinder as well he has every right to do what he wants. 

Then I look closer. My heart stopped. His first picture is a mirror selfie‚Ä¶in my mirror‚Ä¶in my bedroom‚Ä¶.and wedged in the perimeters of my mirror are a bunch of photobooth photos & Polaroids I‚Äôve collected over the years. Me, my friends, my family, my parents. My face is pretty visible you can see the pictures clear as day, actually they seem to be in better focus than he is. It really irked me.

For context: He is my first love/real relationship. He broke things off because he needs to work on himself and couldn‚Äôt provide the same dedication and devotion that I could. It ended pretty amicable. No fights, no arguing. 

Took some space, then decided to try the friends thing. I invited him to my bday/going away party (I‚Äôm leaving the city for new and exciting opportunities) and I mentioned my yard sale to him. I was fine with him coming before but after seeing this on Tinder it kind of hurts my feelings and makes me uncomfortable. 

Any advice on what to do here? If we‚Äôre supposed to be ‚Äúfriends‚Äù should I be honest about the way it made me feel and ask him to remove it? I don‚Äôt want any unnecessary drama and I don‚Äôt want to drag this out any longer, after all i‚Äôm leaving very soon. I‚Äôm lost.

1o597oq,I would‚Äôve loved you through everything,"To my ex, 

I know you think I hate you. I don‚Äôt. I never did. What I hated was how small I had to become to keep your love. How much of myself I had to dim so you could feel like you were enough. You were, you just didn‚Äôt believe it ‚Äî and in trying to convince yourself, you broke me in places you‚Äôll never see.

I loved you with everything I had. I didn‚Äôt love you because of what you had, or what you did ‚Äî I loved you for who you could‚Äôve been if you had faced yourself. The tragedy isn‚Äôt that we ended; it‚Äôs that you never let yourself grow into the man I saw in you.

I used to think love meant staying through pain. Now I know it means knowing when to walk away from what hurts your spirit. You taught me that. You taught me what self-betrayal feels like ‚Äî and how to never do it again.

You will miss me, but not because I was perfect. You‚Äôll miss me because I was safe. Because I gave you the kind of love you‚Äôll spend years trying to recreate with people who only remind you of what you lost. You‚Äôll see my kindness in someone else and think, ‚ÄúShe reminds me of her.‚Äù But she won‚Äôt be me. You can‚Äôt replicate a connection that came from truth.

You said you were afraid of being forgotten. Don‚Äôt worry ‚Äî you won‚Äôt be. You‚Äôre part of the story that built me. But you are not the ending.

I‚Äôm not angry anymore. I‚Äôm not waiting for your apology. I don‚Äôt need to know if you miss me. I‚Äôve finally stopped needing closure from you, because I‚Äôve given it to myself.

I forgive you ‚Äî not because you deserve it, but because I deserve peace.

Take care of the boy inside you. He‚Äôs still running from something that love alone can‚Äôt fix.

‚Äî The woman who finally chose herself.

1o592sd,If it was long distance it wasn't real???,"My relationship ended exactly 2years ago, this year I finally managed to make peace with everything and finally accepted the lessons from it. (it was long distance relationship)

But the thing is even back then few months after the breakup when I was still grieving on my birthday all my friends said the same thing to me ""it was not a real relationship"" cause it was long distance and we never met irl, even the friends that have never been in a relationship were saying this, I ignored this comment and chose not to just walk out on them right that instance. After that I started noticing they stopped taking my advices or my greif seriously, at the start of the breakup I had few things in mind one of them was to never resort to look for a quick rebound and take my time to process everything (I'm glad I was able to follow through)

Everything was quite for some time but the thing is still even yesterday my opinions and advices get shut down by my friends with always the same statements ""your relationship was online"" or ""you never met your lover irl"". I agree that when you meet someone you love irl its different but that doesn't mean it's not a real relationship if you have not met irl. 
I've tried dating someone new irl but it didn't feel that different, plus for me it feels like I'm not even able feel for anyone romantically so I took a step away from dating rather than hurting someone in not able give my all. Obviously my friends don't understand it and ask how long I'm gonna be stuck. (it has come to a point I don't feel like sharing anything with anyone, but this is irrelevant to my post tho)
 
These past 2 years I tried to not let such statements get to me but slowly they have now ( that's why I'm letting it out on this post, I'd appreciate your thoughts on this as well). ngl these are the moments I miss my ex the most, she was always there for me in moments like these, she made it feels all so simple I never worried about what others said when she was here. my ex was closer to me than any of my irl friends.

Does everyone think just cause 2 people were long distance they didn't have a real relationship or they didn't have real feelings for each other.  

I kind of ranted a lot 
For what's it worth remember everyone, every love story/relationship is different I hope you won't feel down with someone else's words, what works for one person doesn't mean it works for everyone. Accept the advice from others but be wise how you learn from it and implement it in your own life.

1o58y3q,I need help and advice,"So for 8 months I dated the most perfect girl ever. Wont hurt a fly. Was the nicest girl you can ever imagine with the nicest family and friends and would do literally anything for you. And to add on top she‚Äôs is the most gorgeous girl in the world.

She was there for every step of the way flying down just to see me go through surgery and all the rehab that went with that.  For some reason that I didn‚Äôt know to those day and I took my depression and anger from the injury and took it out all on her. Repeatedly saying heinous things that I don‚Äôt even want to say and not letting her touch me, not being there for here etc. She would tell me multiple times I need to stop but I didn‚Äôt and she ended up breaking up with me. I don‚Äôt even know how to start. I didn‚Äôt eat sleep or leave my bed in 3 days. At first I just begged and asked for her back. I sadly learned she‚Äôs not coming back.

We were 4 years in but our first year was bad when we came into relationship she lied to me often, she talked with ex who she considers a friend, also she has a past of a lot of casual sex and drug abuse which I don‚Äôt know what to make of, like i cant change but it did sting. Also her parents didn‚Äôt like me, they would have never accepted me. 

So 4 years in and I had to start thinking of marriage, and although I loved her all this made me really unsure our future, I got paranoid and abandoned her, she kept coming back and I zoned out. We always cherished each other and were like children together, it was the most comforting thing to be with her, she did a lot of efforts for me which no one else would do, she put her heart out for me and wanted a future with me but I checked out at the end. Now, pointing everything I had also made a lot of mistakes in the relationship. 

Now after 2 months I realised my mistake but she says it‚Äôs too late i dont know what to do, she said i didn‚Äôt fight for her and shes right ",Hour-Guide9844,1760324891.0,3,0.8,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o58m7d/i_broke_up_because_i_wasnt_sure/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o58m7d/i_broke_up_because_i_wasnt_sure/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False

1o58h2c,I (25M) unsure ab getting back with my ex (21F),"I 24M and my former partner 21F have been split up for about a month now. I can‚Äôt stop thinking of her and longing to be with her once again. Our relationship had gone on for around 2 years or so and this is my 3rd actual major relationship and her 2nd. About a year in there was a month apart and we both were unfaithful to each other. We worked past that but our trust took a hit in the process as well (primarily hers in me). Fast forward another year and a couple other incidences of me not being the best partner (wandering eyes, flirty conversations w others not her, further degrading her trust in me), we finally hit the point where we are longer together. It was relatively mutual at the end because i didn‚Äôt think i could be the man she wanted me to be or the one she deserved and all the hits our trust and love took. I think there is still much love shared between us two. and after some time apart and after new experiences I long for her even more and wish she was here to share them with. time apart has made me realize what we had and good it really was, on the other hand I‚Äôm still unsure if we should be together. I want to go back so badly, but a small part of me is scared i won‚Äôt be good enough or i‚Äôll end up back where we started (hurting her because i can‚Äôt be the man she wants me to be). Another part of me also enjoys the freedoms of single life, but i don‚Äôt want this forever and she was so good to me. i was messing up and not what she deserved (possibly self sabotaging a little). in my other 3 major relationships I‚Äôve struggles with FOMO if you will? Like I‚Äôm really good here, but could i be great elsewhere else? As if the grass is greener over there. Side note: after some time in my relationships I begin to desire physical connections outside of my partner, it‚Äôs not dire but it is something that pops in every now and then and sometimes lingers. I also have recently began therapy as well, still new but a work in progress nonetheless.

1o587z3,"It's been 5 months, I was letting go. Today I found her engagement ring in the junk drawer.","Well here I am again. Feeling as low as the same day it all went down. In May of 2025 I had my whole earth shattered around me, one bad day changed everything. Or maybe is was a bunch of shitty days that culminated into a massive heartbreak. I have never felt so alone, and lost in my life.

Let me explain. Me and my EX partner were two very different people: she was a bubbly hippy when I met her. Very cute, always talkative and a straight up alcoholic. She had many faults but I always found her so attractive and smart despite her flaws. I am a blue collar worker, wasn't straight edge by any means but had my life together for the most part. We were great friends before our relationship. As she was my bestfriends girlfriend at the time. Needless to say things between them eroded over time and they broke up. She would always come crying to me during that time about how bad it was still living with him. She would say he was abusive, and they were constantly in screaming matches. This made me feel very deeply for her as I thought she was a wonderful person; and she did not deserve that treatment. These days I think I was very blind about this woman. The weird part is I still care so much.

This was the catalyst of me and her pursuing each other, and the end of a friendship between me and her EX partner. Now my EX bestfriend. They were still living together at the time but separated. He set us up to go to a concert together as she didn't want him to come with, but he wanted someone he trusted there to keep her safe. I betrayed his trust that night and me and her slept together. That was three and a half years ago.

This night, these decisions led me down a road of actively pursuing this woman with everything I had. Emotionally, I was there for anything she needed. Financially as well. I knew the beginnings of our relationship were horrible and I felt great remorse for my actions, but there was a part of me that was so selfishly in love with this woman I did not stop. I did everything in my power to stay by her side and let it be known she was the love of my life, and I'd always be there. She told me she would be there to.

Well, call me na√Øve cause that was a fucking lie. The Alcoholism grew so bad. At first it was just from her. I started picking up this habit along the way, it's still a fairly aggressive problem and leads me to just missing her to the point of heartache and feeling suicidal. She was getting drunk before work (when she actually had a job, think she went through 14 gigs in the span of our relationship) at work, come home drink more. Rinse and repeat. For a long time I dusted this red flag, believing she was deeply hurt mentally. She struggled with PTSD and come to find out later, after she left me BPD. Both clinically diagnosed. So I felt a major role of stability and structure was important, I wanted to help her and love her so bad. So I stayed. I had broken up with her on a few different instances but we would always come back around in a few days time. She would get so drunk and get handsy with other men. Getting absolutely plastered and falling asleep while her son was around us. That resulted in a lot of fights over the years, screaming matches. I just couldn't ever understand why she would treat me so poorly or act this way. I figure it's because I forgave her so easily. Blinded by love I let her stomp all over me like a doormat; and in turn she stopped respecting me. Or maybe she never did.

She lied to me a lot, and manipulated me to no end. She would make up stories about her life to sound impressive, would call out of work and tell me they let her have the day off. Only for her to get fired because she didn't show up enough. Or lie to me about her whereabouts to go get drunk with god knows who. There were a lot of months I was hemorrhaging my bank account and credit cards to stay afloat, because not only was I supporting this woman and her son. She could never have enough when it came to gifts, nice things that she wanted. Being what I thought was a good man of course I obliged. This was a mistake and I see that now. Aside from everything I did for her son, he is a sweetheart and deserves the world despite his mothers flaws. I wouldn't take that back. 

Needless to say I know a lot of what I'm pointing to is negative. You might be reading this and saying to yourself ""Why would you ever put yourself through this?"" and to answer your question. It was the fact of purpose. I found someone so beautiful, and mentally fucked up I figured sub-consciously this was my new goal in life. I wanted this person, I thought she was absolutely stunning and smart. I loved her personality, and how quirky she could be. Believe it or not she was an amazing cook. Best I ever met.  Despite the red flags I went to the ends of the earth to stay connected to the good. The times where we held each other and just existed, and what I perceived at the time to be the most genuine loving eyes that had ever looked my way. She meant the world to me, and her kid did to. 

I payed thousands of dollars to get her back on her feet. The reason she never could keep a job is because she had a DUI. So about two years in to our relationship I dedicated all of my extra finances into getting that paid off. Over 10,000$, bought her a car paid for court fines, all extra expenses. I was so excited to see her evolve her life after being held down for such a long time. She used this freedom to spite me eventually. It was all about her personal gain my acts of kindness were to be taken advantage of. She cheated on me with her co-worker. A few other men as well. Let's get into that.

Fast forward to this year, end of may 2025. We had gotten into it again over something I cannot even remember. Regardless she was fuming mad at me. I'm driving from out of town for work back to where we live, and my whole objective for the day is to go meet at her work so I can help her finish up and smooth things out. My sides were hurting extremely bad for some reason. I was hyperventilating the entire drive back. I figured it was stress, but then I started puking. Like, a lot. I ignored it and eventually arrived at her work. To preface this story with a little more context she is a cook at an old folks facility. So my purpose coming there was to help her with the dishes. I stumble myself into her kitchen looking pale faced and just really sick. Start trying to help out, she's acting odd to me. Being really mean, saying ""I'm not working hard enough"" and ""If I actually respected her I'd be doing a better job."" All sorts of really rude comments. Turns out, she was very drunk. As being the chef gave her access to any and all alcohol on the property. I'm feeling so sick I have to step outside. Start puking uncontrollably by my car. She comes out and is screaming at me about how worthless I am and she deserves better just a bunch of evil shit. End of her shift comes, the evil bickering does not end. I tell her I gotta go up into our apartment and try to mitigate how I'm feeling with a shower. She's drunkenly yelling at me that if I ""Don't let her drive me to the ER she's gonna call the police on me, get me locked in a psych ward."" Just not making much sense. I leave her in the car go upstairs to try and take a shower.

She eventually comes inside and stumbles through the bathroom door, still just lighting me up and yelling at me. I am in so much pain at this point I can hardly understand. I got to the point where I just couldn't take it anymore, looked her dead in the face and screamed at the top of my lungs ""JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP!."" This was the turning point that my relationship with this woman never came back from. After I said that, he whole face got white. Her pupils shrunk to the size of pins. In total flight mode. Then she told me she was going to call the police on me. I couldn't make sense of it, I knew I was really sick though and needed to go to the hospital. So I started packing my things to leave.

While this woman is on the phone with the cops she is telling them I'm homicidal. That I'm going to kill her, and myself and that I'm armed. I am in total disbelief and none of this is making sense to me. I am really, really just trying to stay conscience at this point. She then is coerce me to stay telling me she's ordering food, and it's gonna be here soon. As if I hadn't just heard her tell the police I'm literally armed and dangerous... So I get outside finally to leave. Needless to say I am surrounded by cops as soon as my feet hit the pavement. They question me, question her. I'm telling them the last thing I want to do is hurt anybody or myself, I am in desperate need of medical attention. I let them know how belligerently drunk she is. She's outside flirting with police, just making a whole joke of this giant scene she's caused. They eventually see how ridiculous this whole thing is and let me leave. As a side note, she left my firearm next to our front door to try and incriminate me. I spent three days in the ICU. Almost died. I was going through renal failure and had no idea. My EX never texted me or tried to check up on me one time during this whole event. I did get a hold of her myself and let her know exactly how unforgivable of an action this was, and how heartless I felt her to be for trying to get me locked up for literally nothing. 

I get out of the hospital and this woman is nowhere to be found. Think this is around the time she started actively cheating on me. We decided to try and work it all out, she wanted to move. I helped her. I helped her move her entire life into a brand new apartment. I let her take full advantage of me and use me as a resource for anything she needed or wanted during this time, because I could not stop loving her. My mind was and still is so warped from my time in the hospital and everything after. I do not like to throw the word trauma around as I think it is overused, but I was (and still am) absolutely traumatized from being beaten down so hard by the woman I wanted to spend the rest of my life with culminated with a near death experience. The broken promises of starting a family and being together forever. Up until mid July of this year I tried very hard to put all of these broken pieces I had no business touching back together. During that time I had found the evidence of her cheating on me with multiple men on her phone. the reason why the co-worker is so specific is because I allowed them to hang out together alone. I had met him numerous times. He knew me. She lied to me about all of it of course even when the evidence was strewn out in front of me. I broke that day... harder than I ever have in my entire life. I lost all self esteem, the will to want to live my life anymore. My ambition absolutely gone.  

Now for the final part of this story. The most heartbreaking, stupid thing I have ever done. There was a concert last month. At this point communication between me and her has been pretty sparse. We hadn't talked in about a weeks time, I was trying to separate myself from her. Curb drinking and just find who I was again. I still haven't, I feel lost. She had a habit of leading me on, and had been doing that between our brief interactions claiming we would see each other soon or she misses me. She wanted to still be friends and she loved me. I believe this all now to be a narcissistic tactic to keep me around if she ever needed me again. Anyways she let it be known that she was going to see a show, and had yet again intrigued me to miss her. I made a really stupid decision that day. I ended up drinking again, and had this wild ridiculous notion pop into my head. Like something straight out of a movie, which she is a wild movie buff so it makes sense to me why my brain chose to do this. Seems like she always wanted a romantic gesture offered to her this way but my execution was horrible, and sloppy. I decided I was going to this concert, uninvited. I was going to find her in the crowd and give her a bouquet of flowers. My plan did not extend from this point. I was heartbroken. In some delusional way I thought that maybe she would see me for who I am, and want me back in her life. Let me preface this in saying, I have not been right since I got out of the hospital. Major mood swings, cannot get my mind away from my EX. Mix that with alcohol and it's a full on different person. This is extremely out of character for me to ever attempt and I still cringe hard at it. Honestly I feel creepy as fuck for ever doing it, but I did. She absolutely hated it. Was at the concert with the co-worker she cheated on me with. I never seen her couldn't find her, so I got a hold of her over text and asked if she was gonne be there, I ha surprise for her etc. Called me realized I was drunk. Texted me I was ""freaking her out"" and then it hit me. I was now the problem. Regardless of how sweet the gesture was, or how I could try and justify my actions in my mind I was never supposed to be there. At this concert, trying to win back a person that obviously wanted nothing to do with me. I had lost my way, and my character spoke for itself. I was a desperate, lonely, and broken man. So I left. I took those flowers and gave them to a pretty couple at the show. I drove home, intoxicated. Crashed my truck. Then I limped it home and went to bed.

Since then I have talked to her a few more time. Her insurance was attached to my bank info still so I had to get a hold of her. This was about one month after the concert. I was pretty cut and dry with her, didn't try and entertain any of her small talk. She asked me if I was done with the break I told her I wanted to take talking with her after that whole incident, which I had set that boundary because. Well, I just couldn't imagine any relationship involving her would work out. I was going to cut her out forever, she just didn't know it. The last conversation we had was very pleasant, we caught up about life. Her child, family. What's going on in our free time. Me being so stupid at the end of that last call told her how much she still meant to me, and then I cut it off and said I'll keep my feelings to myself and I love her. She just said I'll talk to you later and never responded to that comment. The last thing I texted her, and hopefully the last words I'll ever say to her again was the day after we spoke. I asked her out to dinner, nothing serious. She ignored me for a week. So I blocked her.

Today, I found her engagement ring in the junk drawer and it tore me to pieces. I hope I'll be okay.  

If you guys have any additional questions to my story let me know. There is WAY to much to cover in one post. I just needed to let this out, to anyone suffering from heartbreak I am so sorry. This has been the worst experience of my personal life and I know a lot of us hurt to the core. I hope we get better.

1o57vjg,Discarded/Broken Up With After 9 Years. Deeply struggling & advice needed,"Hi everyone. 25F here still dealing with the heartbreak of my  breakup with my partner of 9 years (Also 25F) 4 months later. We had been together, on and off at some points, since we were 16. Before anyone says that relationships that young don't usually last, this was my best friend and someone who I planned to be with forever and vice versa. We had a bond so deep and so strong that withstood long distance, growing up together, figuring out our sexualities, going through changes, personal traumas, splitting up before, etc.

The breakup was not mutual and it was more like a discard. She was the only person I have ever been with and this is my first heartbreak. It is a very long story that would be too long to put into a post due to the messy nature of it and all of the wrongs that were done to me which sucks because I REALLY need advice. I do have a therapist but sometimes I just want the perspective of people who have been through this before.

I apologize for the messiness that I am about to attempt to talk about.

My partner was an artist getting ready to make a project of their own, something I was also set to collaborate on. A couple weeks before the breakup, my partner had come to me telling me that due to a recent personal experience working on a project with a guy she had met in the same industry, she was now unsure of her identity and sexuality. As a bisexual woman, I offered her a lot of reassurance and open conversation talking about this and her newfound feelings towards herself. She asked me if I had ever thought about wanting to leave to be with a guy. I said no because she was my person. In the weeks before this conversation, she would nonstop talk about this guy to me and how she wants him to work on her creative project with us. Due to also being in the same industry, I worked a lot with my partner to bring my own knowledge and help to the project, and even donating hundreds of dollars to fund it ( to which I never really received a thank you, btw). I put a lot of time and effort into helping her on that project. Long story short, I was partially responsible for getting the guy on board for her project. After he was locked into the job, she not only began pulling away but also started doing my job and leaving me out of things and would get mad if I brought it up. She told me she had a weekend planned for this guy to come to her apartment and stay for the weekend so they could work on the project together. Although I did not live with her, she never asked me how I felt about this. And from what she told me, he also was in a relationship.

A week or so goes by, I am on my way to my partner's apartment. She starts a fight with me before we head out to eat. I got upset at the restaurant and she began telling me she knows why I am upset, that she knows I know what is going on, etc. (I had no clue what she was talking about). She makes us leave to go back to her apartment, and boom she begins to dump me and tells me she is attracted to the guy and questioning her sexuality. She cried. I held her and tried to be as understanding as possible. She told me she expected me to be mad and to not be mad at the guy. I told her I thought he was in a relationship and she told me they broke up. That told me ALL I needed to know. She told me nothing physical happened between them or would happen during the making of their project but that he was ""ruining her life"". I tried to stay as calm and understanding as possible. I kept asking her if this was a breakup, since she was talking about our relationship in past tense. She refused to tell me.

The next day, while I was working, she began texting me all of the reasons why she was unsure about our relationship, even though I asked her to please save these conversations for in person. She sent those texts anyways and honestly, I grew really emotional and nervous and began begging her not to do this. I asked her multiple times if this was a breakup, and she ignored it. I begged and pleaded and made dramatic offers.  offered an open relationship. She proceeded to tell me she felt like I was backing her into a corner. I told her if she was breaking up with me, that I don't think I could stay friends because this hurt and was not mutual. I apologized for getting emotional. The next day she went out shopping with a friend like nothing happened. I asked her why she was out acting like nothing just happened and she told me I was the one who said it was a breakup and that was the reality she began to process. She also sent a long message expressing everything I said wrong while being broken up with and that she needed a lot of space.

I am not going to lie, I kept sending her messages apologizing and trying to explain myself. I was panicking and distraught and being denied clarity. I remembered she had a work event a few days later after not speaking. We talked about me going before all of this. I messaged her asking if she still wanted me to go. No reply. I winded up going anyways because I genuinely just wanted to support her and thought it could be the last time. I went and kept to myself. She winded up seeing me and I told her I wasn't there for anything but to support her and that Id leave if she wanted me to. She said hello to her friends and didn't even introduce me, I just stood there like a fool. She told me she told her friends that we were ""on a break"". Her friend apparently told her that she thinks I had good intentions by showing up. Anyways, she asked to have an in person conversation even though she looked very uncomfortable and burdened. We sat outside and she basically began telling me she wanted out of the relationship, is unsure of her sexuality/identity, doesn't know what she wants, it was her/not me, etc. I begged again. I cried. Kept telling me all the wrong things I said during the breakup even though I was nothing but calm and understanding. We logically tried talking it out over food once the emotions passed. She refused an open relationship and told me she did not want to string me along. She told me she might catch feelings for the guy when he comes and stays at her apartment. I told her I was willing to have her explore if thats what she needed. She told me she did not want me on the project anymore. We walked back to her apartment. She thanked me for coming, asked for a hug, which was not warm at all, and I went home.

The next day she sent a stream of reassuring messages telling me she cares about me so much, that I did not do anything wrong, that she is just confused about her identity, that she won't ghost me, won't abandon me, that I am still her best friend, that she will NOT go no contact. She said she just needed time to figure herself out and that we should not use labels on our relationship moving forward. Over the next two days, she slowly drifted away. She was expressing feeling mentally unwell and stressed, and I offered to come take care of her. She slowly drifted away and the responses became less. The weekend came where the guy stayed at her apartment. She immediately turned off her location, went radio silent, and deleted all of our pictures together off of her social media. I never heard from her again and I never reached back out since she made me feel unwanted.

It's been four months post discard. Looking back at the text messages she had shared between her and the guy, he was very obviously flirting with her and initiated staying at her apartment. I met him once, and he never acknowledged me. He never acknowledged me during the project either and kept me off of emails. I believe she was testing the waters with me.

The last time we talked was June 11th. Between then and now, she removed every trace of me off of her social media. A mutual friend started posting pictures of her smiling and having a good time. She still followed me and viewed my stories. I winded up growing the strength to block her after she posted the new boy onto her social media, unfollowed my best friend, and changed her profile picture and began being super active on social media, something she never did before.

My friends have been trying to get me out of the house and lift me up and they all claim I did nothing wrong to deserve this regardless of my flaws and imperfections in the relationship but I have a hard time believing them. My best friend said she did not get a good vibe from her. My mom also said she never got a good vibe from her either. My mom held a grudge against her for arguing with me on the phone the same week my dad passed away as to why we shouldn't be together. A big flaw on my end in this relationship was  not bringing her around my mom ever since my dad passed away because I knew my mom did not like her, and she's also homophobic, causing my girlfriend to feel hidden sometimes. However, my friends knew her, and I posted her on social media being out.

I am in therapy and I have good days and bad days. But to be honest, I am really struggling to get over this. I have abandonment trauma as it is and she was well aware of this. I feel emotionally cheated on, betrayed emotionally, and financially and professionally exploited. I cannot believe I could be so blind and foolish. I have a lot of self-hatred and I blame myself every day even though everyone tells me I did nothing wrong. My reality feels warped. I have no way of knowing what happened between her and the guy.

I would have never done ANY of this to her. I am utterly crushed, depressed, and really struggling is an understatement. It has not gotten any easier besides leaning on my friends.

Yesterday, she deleted the playlists she made for me when we were younger. She has my playstation that I spent money on and my belongings that she did not send me back. Maybe it is my responsibility to reach out and ask, but I do not want to speak to her without going off on her. Part of me wants to reach out and tell her off for being such a coward but I refuse to give her any of my time or effort or words. But it sucks.

What the hell do I do and what should I think about this entire thing? I still have so much love for her regardless. But I am hurting deeply.

1o57to3,Will this improve? I can't just make it stop being awkward.,"I need to vent :(
We separated a month and a half ago. After 8 years of relationship. We have a 3 year old daughter. We lived together for 4 years.
The first 3 weeks I did everything I shouldn't have. I cried. I begged him. And all.
He cheated on me the day he left. I discovered it. 
And he left but he continued acting as if nothing had happened.
He went to his parents' house. The first month was a push and pull. He is attached avoidant and I am anxious. He has his addiction to marijuana. And that has always brought us problems. 
After a month he told me that he didn't love me and that he had stopped loving me a long time ago... and that he was in love with the person he cheated on me with... and to protect myself and be able to let go I am making 0 contact.

It is difficult to stop loving4 or to let go without wanting to do so... but I already accepted it... and in that process I experienced many disrespectful things and things that I should not have allowed. 

This year I had spinal surgery and he behaved in the worst way and everyone noticed... what's more, my relatives were waiting for him to leave me... because of how he acted. 

The thing is... since I set limits and zero contact. He has completely forgotten about his daughter. She doesn't make video calls before, she did it almost daily... I told her to call if she wanted to talk to her but not to write because she wasn't going to answer. He only sees her on Sundays for a couple of hours, he takes her to his parents' house... there is almost no money... thank God I can support us...
The first month he would lie in bed. I spent hours here pretending to eat like a family on a Sunday. He asked where he was or talked about our house or our things... there are still covers for his things here that he doesn't take. It confused me, it hurt me and that's why I set limits 

It doesn't hurt me that he stopped loving me... he has every right. He decided to let us go and continue his life. It hurts me that he made me believe every last thing that he loved me while he decided to leave.  
I don't know if he doesn't call because it's uncomfortable for me... but my daughter misses him, he was a 10/10 potato.

The mother was worried because the first 2 weeks he arrived super late drunk or didn't arrive until the next day.
They never loved me. And they pimp everything out.
Now I communicate with the mother and not with him. 
In his networks it still seems that he has his family... but according to what I asked, the reason why he doesn't delete the photos or keep them is because he doesn't care...

I am already at a stage where I see everything clearly. I don't want him to come back. I don't wait for it anymore. But it makes me angry and it hurts me for everything I gave and allowed so much. I lost myself for a person who didn't want it, who didn't deserve it.

I hope soon to be able to see it and not feel anything. Well, he's not going to disappear, he's my daughter's father.",Odd_Job_5455,1760322549.0,1,0.99,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o57to3/will_this_improve_i_cant_just_make_it_stop_being/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o57to3/will_this_improve_i_cant_just_make_it_stop_being/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False

1o57qtq,I want to break up with my girlfriend but don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the right choice,"So I (21M)have been dating my girlfriend(22F) E(fake name) for 6 months and it‚Äôs has been good up until the last 3 months, E and I started dating when I lived in Arizona and everything was pretty good for the most part other than random arguments or fights here or there. I recently moved to a different country and we decided to go long distance. Since we have gone long distance a lot of her personality and negative sides have come very much to light and I don‚Äôt know if can deal with it anymore, some context behind this is E has BPD and I know she struggles with it daily. A big struggle that E and I have been having is good communication when it comes to things that she gets upset about or make her feel negative. Weather that‚Äôs about: Us, Me, Or other life problems. We have talked about it multiple times and tried different things to help so we can communicate better and it doesnt seem like any of it ever works, She is unable to take any form of rejection also she has bad look on herself and has a lot of self hatred and thinks most people are out to get her or no one is ever on her side, I big theme I feel in our relationship is that when she is ok and happy our relationship is good but when she is upset or mad our relationship feels very bad. I love her very dearly and don‚Äôt want to leave her but at this point it seems as she is never really happy for more than a day and I can‚Äôt seem to ever make her feel better more than that amount of time.

1o57k2o,Im just lost,"Its been a week since my wife left. This isnt the first time but it is most definitely the last time. It wasnt the greatest relationship but I loved her like nothing else and did everything I could to try and make things better for the both of us. Most of the relationship was me covering everything, bills, cooking, planning outings etc. Even though I did all this it never felt like she valued me in anyway. Most of the time I would have to ask her to make time for me. Or ask if she could help me with things or just generally be around me when doing something. She was the only real in person friend I had and was the absolute priority in my life. But it never seemed to be the same for her. 3 weeks ago she expressed wanting to leave and being unhappy but still loving me. The next two weeks we just spent time together and it was everything I asked for throughout our entire relationship. Then on friday her mother showed up. That night me and her talked I cried saying things can get better and we have proved that and after about an hour or 2 of conversing she agreed to stay. She said we should do couples therapy and she needs to do her own therapy to work on herself. I was ecstatic and then we cuddled very close and went to bed. I left for work in the morning. While at work she said she was going shopping with mom and sent me updates. I spent most of work just looking to schedule all these plans. Outings, therapy everything. I had it all set up but not paid for. I come home from work and all her stuffs gone. I call a couple times no answer. Text nothing. Her mom texts me saying sorry and to not take her off the insurance. 

I took her off after that. She was the only person I really connected with in life and she knew what she did would hurt me the most. and now here I am just lost. I planned my entire life with this women im only 25 now we were married for 5-6 years. I did everything to build our future and made decisions according to that. Now im just alone with my dog. I have friends online but thats it. I live real rural so not much to go out and do. So now I just sit in a house that for years all I did was envision our future. Its just whittling me down. Im haunted by the thoughts that constantly go through my head. Feeling like discarded trash to the person I would die for. I really wonder if all the fun times, the love she expressed was just fake. 

In retrospect this ending should be good. She cheated before, never treated me like a priority in life and never worked with me on anything. But she was all I had and I loved her so deeply. Im just lost and alone. I already have a pretty nihilistic view on life but it felt worth doing if I had her. What do I do? Should I move away to separate myself from this hell hole of memories. Wait to make and drastic changes? I wish I could just end it but I have a dog that I love very much so for at least her time I will tough through. 

Sorry for the long dump of words. I have 7-8 years of built up venting, frustration, and feeling of worthlessness with nowhere to go.

1o57i3a,Fresh break up need advice?,"I‚Äôm not really sure where to start I‚Äôve never used Reddit before. To preference my ex(Marisa) found me at a party and then the following summer saw me posted on my university instagram where she followed me and we went on a date. From the first night it was great she seemed so invested and enthusiastic, our first date was Nov 15 2024, we labeled our relationship January 28,2025 and everything was great. Now the situations I took as red flags, first when we hung out with her guy friends I asked if she ever liked any of them and she denied ever looking at them as more than friends. A couple months later I find out she was lying and hooked up with one of the ‚Äúfriends‚Äù and she said she‚Äôs hooked up with her friends from home. I never had a problem with it other than the fact that she lied and hid it from me. Another instance she got mad at me because In the beginning of our relationship I still snap chatted my friend from freshman year and she told me she didn‚Äôt want me to and I said because it made her uncomfortable I had no issue doing that for her but she had to do the same and not snap other guys. Two weeks after that she is still snapping other guys and gets mad when I bring it up. So many different things happened like this and when I would try to bring up that through her actions I feel like she doesn‚Äôt prioritize me and like I put in more effort, this is when the pattern started of her begging for more chances and saying how it‚Äôll be different. It would be different for a week and then return to her doing things that we discussed especially when I was just holding her to the same standard. Eventually I started realizing I provide everything for her, I made her food twice a day wake her up drive her to class make sure she eats and doesn‚Äôt forget what she has to get done, yet if I asked her to make brownies while I was cooking dinner she would argue then put in the least amount of effort ultimately making them un edible. Saturday she broke up with me, the Wednesday before we went over weekend plans because my family was visiting and then the first night she‚Äôs supposed to be with us she flakes, then the second day she‚Äôs trying to make plans with her roomates that she also claimes to hate. She ends up joining my family and I Friday night but acts weird, like normal she is enthusiastically talking to everyone except for me actually purposely ignoring me (she has done this before when we are in public) and then we were gonna leave then come back and she said she‚Äôd be returning to the house to hangout with everyone and said to me in the car she was glad to be going back so she can get extra cloths to change into. A couple seconds later say she wants a break I say that it is okay and if she really thinks it‚Äôs best then that‚Äôs what she needs to do and I suppose that was the wrong answer because then she gets mad and then blames me but I remind her that everything she was saying was things she didn‚Äôt want me to do so I held her to her own standards. Eventually she gets out of my truck standing in the rain but says she doesn‚Äôt want to leave and I say to get back in sit down and we‚Äôll talk more, she gets in and starts screaming and then I say I can‚Äôt keep doing this I need you to leave I give her a hug she gets up when she goes to leave she says she needs help but I reminded her that I was the one trying to help her the entire time and now I can‚Äôt any more and she says goodbye then I leave. Fast forward to tonight she sends me a long text message but it sounded weird so I put it into chat gtp zero and it said likely Ai generated. 

I don‚Äôt really know what I‚Äôm looking to get out of this i just think a lot and I want to put it out somewhere that feels right. So many different factors go into the breakup and I know it was the right thing like I knew it was un healthy when I was trying so hard but it feels so weird now I‚Äôm not mad at her or anything like that but like I feel so defeated.",Hot-Difficulty6817,1760321617.0,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o57i3a/fresh_break_up_need_advice/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o57i3a/fresh_break_up_need_advice/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False

I know my place in how and why it ended, a Big part of it was my fault.. but I still wish the relationship mattered to you as much as it mattered to me, how much YOU mattered to me, the fact that you only have so long, a handful of years at most, and yet it felt like you gave up on me‚Ä¶ It was only a month sure.. the best month of life because I spent nearly every day of it with you.

You wrote such beautiful paragraphs.. words I never thought I‚Äôd hear in all my life, and I hate that such words, such promises of devotion were but fodder, empty in the face of things I couldnt control..

1o57aqp,Girlfriend broke up with me but wants to be friends? Is this salvageable?,"TL;DR me, M 29, was broken up by my girlfriend, F 27, last Sunday as she loves me but doesn't think the way she loves me is proper for a relationship.

I would like to discuss this with women over 30 to get a female perspective on my situation. For context, me and my ex girlfriend had no problems. This relationship was very healthy on all avenues and was extremely fun. She has even offered friends multiple times since the week ended. We have currently decided to be cold turkey for now and let us both heal from the relationship ending. It was 5 months and long distance but I would see her for a full week a month due to my work. We had a strong, fun, trusting relationship where I would take care of all her needs and she would take care of mine. I've never had more fun and care felt in a relationship and I would totally consider being friends. She has told me that nothing wrong happened in the relationship and that I am perfect, it is simply the love feeling not the way she thinks it should.

My ex girlfriend got married when she was 18 and that lasted 7 years so she has not really had the opportunity to explore. I am thinking that the love feeling she has with me is different and healthy and she doesn't feel that's proper. I am not currently talking to her but would like to try as friends again and see if things can develop again after we both grow and she really focuses on herself which she has not really done.

My Question:

I am questioning that if her prior relationship has caused problems in this relationship. I would like to be friends at a minimum and see if something could develop but I still want her in my life and in time I will reach out once we've had some time (probably around Thanksgiving as an ice breaker)

La llamar√© Celine para mantener su privacidad.

Celine y yo tuvimos una relaci√≥n muy sana que dur√≥ un a√±o y cuatro meses. Terminamos porque nos costaba encontrar tiempo para vernos debido al trabajo y la universidad. No fue por peleas ni por falta de amor, simplemente no coincid√≠amos.

Despu√©s de terminar, tuvimos dos meses de contacto cero, en los que incluso me ten√≠a bloqueado de Instagram. Luego, empezamos a hablar de nuevo por WhatsApp. Con el tiempo, comenz√≥ a decirme cosas como ‚Äúnunca dej√© de amarte‚Äù o ‚Äúcon mi pareja actual me cuesta decirle novio‚Äù.

Yo le confes√© que quer√≠a arreglar lo que hab√≠amos dejado inconcluso, y ella me respondi√≥ que tambi√©n quer√≠a hacerlo, que deb√≠amos hablar m√°s seguido. Empez√≥ a hablarme por Instagram (incluso puso de fondo la imagen que ten√≠amos cuando √©ramos pareja).

Cada vez que sub√≠a una historia donde sal√≠a mi cara o pon√≠a algo con indirectas hacia ella, me daba like. Durante ese tiempo fue mucho m√°s cari√±osa que antes, al punto de decirme frases como ‚Äúeres lo mejor que me ha pasado en la vida‚Äù o ‚Äúextra√±o lo que ten√≠amos‚Äù.

Sin embargo, poco despu√©s me enter√© de que estaba saliendo con otro chico, a quien conoci√≥ recientemente (su actual pareja). Desde ah√≠ su actitud cambi√≥ completamente: dej√≥ de responder, ya no reaccionaba a mis historias y finalmente me bloque√≥.
Lo que me desconcierta es que solo tres d√≠as antes de bloquearme, me hab√≠a dicho que me ten√≠a mucho amor y que siempre iba a ser una persona importante para ella.

1o56mkk,I still miss her.,"(16M) Everything about her was perfect. Literally everything if you asked me to tell you everything I liked about her I would never stop talking. I broke broke up with her a little over a year ago. At the time I was 15 years old and very new to relationships. I had been in one other relationship a few months prior. It ended on good terms. Nothing else to say really. Then I met L. We clicked instantly and got together rather quickly even for my age. We were together for 4 amazing months if im not mistaken, I have terrible memory. Since about one and a half years before my first ex I have had depression. This did have an impact on mine and Ls relationship as I often wanted to be alone. But she stayed with me and was always supportive and just the best. Two weeks before the breakup I started ‚Äùliking‚Äù a girl in my school. (L lives 30 minutes away) Atleast at the time I thought I liked this girl. Now I know I didn‚Äôt. I just thought she was very attractive. But I thought that if I like another girl I have to break up with L. So I did. I called her an evening and just said I wanted to break up and that I had lost feelings. We both cried a lot. I hadn‚Äôt even lost feelings I just thought I had. Before hanging up she said that we could have a week where we didn‚Äôt talk to each other or anyone else then talk again about breaking up in order to see if it felt right. I very fucking stupidly didn‚Äôt follow through. I started talking to girls on wizz (like yubo (teenage tinder)) She found out as I think I sent a chat to her distant friend. She got very mad as she should and said that we should break up for real so we did. Since that moment I have regretted what happened so incredibly much. She got together with my distant friend shortly after (I got very overly mad at him for not telling me beforehand for some reason). They were together until like two months from now. Since L I have had situationships with a few girls and one decently lengthy relationship. All throughout them she has always been in the back of my mind. Sometimes I almost forget But then one night she comes to mind again. I think I haven‚Äôt gone a week since we broke up without missing her. Now I‚Äôm almost in a new relationship. I still think about L often. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I feel like it‚Äôs wrong to get into another relationship. The one I had in between now and L was during a really rough depression patch where I think I really craved human connection subconsciously. I don‚Äôt know what to do. L is in a new relationship according to her instagram bio. I do not follow her on anything but I can still see it. I can‚Äôt move on I don‚Äôt know what the fuck to do at this point. I either have to get with her or somehow actually move on for real which feels impossible.",PhotographSeparate96,1760319070.0,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o56mkk/i_still_miss_her/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o56mkk/i_still_miss_her/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False

1o56ivb,Ex is inhuman,"Today I had a conversation with my ex, I was informed that 2 weeks post-separation she had already started talking to this one dude. 1 Month in, she had already performed oral sex on him. We were just coming out of a 1.5 year relationship that was very intense, vulnerable, passionate & worked on. What the actual fuck. Even worse, I got sent a picture of them lying in bed with him kissing her. Holy fucking shit. She also told me that she never really loved me despite the sane assumption that she did & that this guy is basically prince charming. I am literally the reason she's alive. I took care of her in her worst times. I helped her get into her dream program. I tirelessly got her to communicate whenever she had her downs. I was there for her emotionally. I did everything she wanted. Of course, I wasn't perfect - I had my downs as well but for the most part I was pretty decent. This is what i fucking get? I get to be told that she's going down on this dude's cock 1 month post breakup? That she's basically being used for oral sex and she's okay with it? absolutely insane. Not to mention, when trying to figure out where things went wrong (spoiler, nothing ever went wrong she just one day had another option LOL) i was practically mocked by both of them. Anyway, a long break from dating is very much due.

1o56i4v,Need advice regarding no contact,"Hello everyone, my name is Rafuyu (M20 & I have autism (it's apparently important to say it on this reddit)) and my ex (M20) broke up with me 6 month ago. We were together for almost 3 years and nothing has been the same since then. We didn't fight, no drama, nothing, just love stopping on his side. 

He asked me not to contact him, and I did so. I changed city and even country, leaving as far as I could from him, to find another ""way of life"" and to obey it's final demand to me. 

I've been trying to move on but... I don't want to... and also can't do so.

He didn't send me a message for my birthday, and I don't even know if he's alive atp.... 

I really want to contact him, just to know if he's alright, to tell him that I keep a picture of us with me at any time, that I don't see a future with anyone else... 

What should I do? Keep my feelings for myself and let him on his own... Or just follow my own will and contact him... I'm not even sure he will answer... 

I'm pretty sure that I'm never going to get over him, and I'm okay with that. In my opinion life is worth remembering a single moment like the most beautiful fragment of life, for eternity. 

I'd like to read advice from other people with autism! But I'll take every experience I can get. 

Thanks for reading this.

1o56hyj,Struggling after a breakup with someone I love because of family issues (Nepal),"Namaste everyone,

I‚Äôm going through a really difficult time and could use some support or advice.

I was in a relationship with someone I deeply care about, but we are distant cousins, and our families would never accept us being together. We recently broke up to avoid causing conflict or tearing our families apart.

Even though I understand why we had to separate, I feel like I can‚Äôt live without them. The pain is overwhelming, and I don‚Äôt know how to cope with this heartbreak.

The worst part is, she has been through so much already ‚Äî her last relationship was abusive and neglectful, and she recently lost her father. I can‚Äôt even comprehend how much she is suffering, and I feel guilty for adding to her pain.

I‚Äôm not asking for solutions to the family situation ‚Äî just guidance on how to survive this emotional pain, cope with guilt, and move forward. If anyone in Nepal has gone through something similar or has advice for coping with heartbreak in our cultural context, I would really appreciate it.",Low-Entrance8609,1760318687.0,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o56hyj/struggling_after_a_breakup_with_someone_i_love/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o56hyj/struggling_after_a_breakup_with_someone_i_love/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False

1o56fcp,I really don‚Äôt know what to do 20m,"Was dumped a few days ago by the love of my life. I know I might be pretty young but still she was everything I‚Äôve ever wanted in a partner and I mean everything. 

She broke up with me after a long trip where we weren‚Äôt able to talk and when she came back ‚Äúthings felt different‚Äù which I do agree but I figured it was just a rough patch of us getting back into our flow

She obviously disagreed and she dumped me but we decided to stay friends. Now when she broke up with me I took it real hard, didn‚Äôt eat didn‚Äôt sleep barely got out I‚Äôd bed am the (unfortunate) classics.

She says she still loves me but not in the same way anymore and more than that she‚Äôs afraid of two main points if we were to get back together.

1: that our relationship would be different and 2: that she doesn‚Äôt want to hurt me again if we break up.

Thing is I agree with her to an extent, I do think our relationship would be different because that‚Äôs just how things work but what I find more important is point 2

Because she even said that if there came a point where she wasn‚Äôt happy with our relationship she would probably still stay to not hurt me. And more than wanting her back I want her to be happy so I know I can‚Äôt do that.

We‚Äôre still staying friends for now and I‚Äôm even on a call with her as I‚Äôm typing this (she‚Äôs trying to sleep) we just had a long conversation about all this

I kinda just want some advice and needed to vent I think, thanks in advance I guess.

1o56589,Should delete it all??,"
Hey guys, I really need some advice because I‚Äôm torn. I was with my ex for about a year and a half , we lived together, shared everything, and honestly, I thought she was my person. Things got messy though. She started pulling away, staying out late, sometimes not coming home until 6 a.m. I used to bring it up because it made me feel anxious and disrespected, but she always made me feel like I was the problem for ‚Äúoverreacting.‚Äù

After we broke up, she moved on so fast. Within a month she was already sleeping around, and I later found out through a mutual friend that she literally slept with three men in one night. She even said the breakup didn‚Äôt hurt her much ‚Äî that she cried one day and then moved on. Meanwhile, I was just completely shattered.

She started dating someone a month after breakup it lasted for a month then dated another guy told people he‚Äôs ‚Äúthe one‚Äù that lasted for 4 months, now she is out there fucking around. She said she can‚Äôt delete our old photos because it‚Äôll make her spiral, but she‚Äôs out here living like I never existed. And that‚Äôs the part that messes with my head. Because she erased us first, and I‚Äôm still sitting here holding onto pictures, videos, and all these Snapchat memories.

Part of me wants to delete everything, like completely wipe her out. Because why should I keep something that just keeps reopening wounds? But another part of me feels like if I delete it all, it‚Äôs like it never happened. Some of those moments were actually beautiful, and I know with time, I‚Äôll forget the little details.

I already burnt all her letters, but I‚Äôm stuck on this last part. Do you guys think I should delete everything and finally close this chapter, or just keep it somewhere???",EvidencePurple2083,1760317627.0,1,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o56589/should_delete_it_all/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o56589/should_delete_it_all/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False

1o55tb2,The thing I can't stop thinking about,"We were together for 10 years. During one of our break up conversations he confessed that about 3 years in he was going to propose while we were on vacation. On that trip, I confessed that I got myself into a bad financial situation with credit cards by buying stuff and hiding packages from him. That scared him and made him decide that he didn't want to propose anymore. 

I never lied about my finances again but never really fixed them either. Then other stuff happened, Covid, then I lost my job, my fear of rejection from not getting hired for another job made more depressed and it took a turn for the absolute worst. I stopped being the person he feel in love with and wanted to marry. 

But the problem is, he never sat me down and never talked to me face to face about how he felt and that I hurt him like that. If he would have said something after the trip or even a year later, I would have taken my life more seriously and tried to fix what I messed up but honestly I didn't know!! He would either wave it off like it was no big deal or he would try talking to me while I wasn't fully paying attention. 

I've loved him since high school and we were together right after I finished college. All I ever wanted was to marry him. I always hinted at it and even started saying it straight on. The guilt and the anger and the sadness of knowing that I could have had it all kills me every single day. Knowing that I'll never get to marry him breaks my heart into a million pieces. 

I know that breaking up was all my fault although he blames himself too.. I don't know how to live with myself knowing that I ruined my relationship with someone that wanted to spend the rest of his life with me. How do I recover after knowing that??

I always push away the hope that maybe in a year or so we might get back together and try it all again. But he has said things to me that make me doubt it. I don't want to hold my breath but deep down I'm begging and praying and hoping that it'll happen. Because I did actually learn a lot from this break up. And I feel like if given the chance, everything would go back to the way it was those first couple years or maybe even better.

1o55t0d,"We both still loved each other, but her sexual attraction for me faded","My (23M) girlfriend (22F) and I were together for almost 3 years, and we broke up about two weeks ago. We loved each other deeply, but there was always one recurring issue that we could never fully overcome.

At the beginning  of our relationship I was incredibly nervous about sex since it was my first relationship and first sexual experience. When she first initiated, I couldn‚Äôt get hard at all. It completely shattered my confidence, and the anxiety that came from that carried into future attempts. For months I struggled with performance, and it put a huge strain on our relationship.

But she was really great and understanding and was patient with me and we kept trying and eventually things improved, sex started to feel more natural and comfortable, and for a while it was actually good. But we also had very different sex drives. She wanted sex more often (around 3+ times a week), while I was comfortable with once a week or even every other week. Over time, that difference started to weigh on us.

She began feeling less sexually attracted to me because of how things started, and that made me feel unwanted. We had many conversations about it, she wanted me to initiate more, and I tried. I really did. I tried new ways of initiating, tried to be more confident, but often she‚Äôd turn me down and say it ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt feel right.‚Äù She told me she couldn‚Äôt fully see me as a sexual partner anymore, but also told me to keep trying. So I did, for over a year but everytime the same thing happens, I initiate and she turns it down but then bring up that she is sad that we never have sex. This weighed on us both heavily, I felt like I was trying my best and initiating more and she was also feeling like she's been trying to have sex with me but everytime we start she gets a mental block and says that she physically can't/don't want to force herself to have sex with me because it doesn't feel right. 

Another thing that happened was that she eventually stopped initiating sex. In the beginning, she initiated often, and I really appreciated that. Every time she did, even if I wasn‚Äôt initially in the mood, I‚Äôd start to get aroused and we‚Äôd end up having sex, or at least trying to, since this was around the time I was still struggling with performance issues. Over time, though, she began initiating less and less.

One night, I told her I was going to call a friend and play an online game. I didn‚Äôt do this often, and I hadn‚Äôt spoken to that friend in ages, so I wanted to catch up and spend some time with them. While we were playing, she came into my room and tried to initiate sex. We were almost done with the game, so I asked if she could wait ten minutes. That completely crushed her, it really hurt her confidence and she was deeply upset. I realised afterward that I‚Äôd messed up, since our sex life was already hanging by a thread at that point. But in that moment, I was focused on the game and the conversation, and I couldn‚Äôt just switch gears instantly. She, on the other hand, expected me to drop everything and be ready right away.

I regret that moment to this day. From then on, she never initiated sex again, and we basically didn‚Äôt have sex for the last year of our relationship. She tried a few times when I initiated, but like I mentioned, it rarely went beyond foreplay, and even getting that far was uncommon, since she often just turned me down. This lead me to stop initiating sex as often as well since everytime I was getting rejected. There were period of months without any initiation on either side.

We eventually saw a sex therapist, and for a little while, things seemed to be improving slowly. But then she told me she just couldn‚Äôt see it working long-term. She said she wanted that ‚Äúmovie-like‚Äù passion and that I wasn‚Äôt confident enough in that way for her. Hearing that broke me, because I loved her so much, and aside from sex, our relationship was amazing.

Now that we‚Äôve broken up and decided to stay friends, she‚Äôs moved to London and seems so much happier. And honestly, I‚Äôm happy for her, she deserves to feel that way. But it still hurts so much. I wanted so badly to be the person who made her happy. I gave everything I had to this relationship, tried to change, to grow, to fix things. But in the end, it just wasn‚Äôt enough.

And I don‚Äôt even know if this is something I can change. I tried everything I could to increase my sex drive and tried to act more confident sexually in the way she wanted, but it's extremely hard to act confident at this point when whenever I initiate she turns it down.

I‚Äôm just heartbroken. It‚Äôs painful to realize that sometimes love really isn‚Äôt enough, even when both people try their best. She also tried her best to want to have sex with me but she just couldn't which hurts so much. She said she was still physically attracted to me, but it's just that when it comes to sex she gets turned off.

I don't know how to process all of this, I keep looking back on our photos and cherishing the memories that we had together, whilst she seemingly already moved on from what I'm hearing. Maybe she hasn't but but everytime I called her she sounded genuinely so much happier, and she has been going out and trying to meet new friends everyday. I wanted so badly to be with her, we had so many plans for the future, we were planning to get a puppy this year, we wanted a family together but now that's just all gone. We left on good terms, we hugged, we kissed, told each other we still loved each other. Maybe wasn't our best idea, but in our final moments she actually initiated sex with me (as a final try), and we did actually have sex, and we both were enjoying it initially, but halfway through she said that it doesn't feel good anymore maybe because of our past experience again and then we just stopped, hugged each other and cried. 

It was a mutual breakup, we both decided that we would stay friends, on the note that we might or might not ever get back together again. But She said maybe one day if we are meant to be, but try to not hold on to the small chance of hope. We both agreed that this breakup is what's best for us at this moment in time for us to just focus on ourselves  and improve ourselves as people and to focus on our careers, since we were both getting a bit lost in the relationship too. I understand this rationally but it doesn't make it much easier to move on from her. Especially since she has been the most amazing person I've ever met, even cloudy days seems so much brighter just because she was there in my life. Now all my days seems to blend to together and everything feels more dull and lifeless.
We decided to stay friends but I don't know if I will ever be able to handle seeing her with another guy in the future.

If you made it this far, I want to say thank for for listening to my story I really appreciate it.

TLDR: broke up with my girlfriend of almost 3 years, everything in the relation has been amazing apart from the sexual side which has been a strain on our relationship for the entire time. We tried to make it work since we love each other a lot but eventually it was too much for us both and we both decided it was best to break up.

1o55o81,Don't understand why it ended like that,"We were dating seriously for several months. He‚Äôs very logical and a workaholic. I‚Äôm more emotional and quite sensitive. Things were really strong between us, connection, emotional intimacy, chemistry, similar intellect and humor. I also cared a lot for him, and he knew it.

Then we started having some conflicts, mostly around communication. For me it's normal, but he didn‚Äôt express a lot emotionally and sometimes came off as cold or critical. I‚Äôd get overwhelmed or hurt and sometimes withdraw or walk away. I have some anxious tendencies, and I‚Äôll admit I tested him slightly at times. I wanted to see some attachment, not just him acting right. He later told me that the emotional tension made his feelings start to fade. That really hurt.

After one fight, he brought up the idea of taking a break. This was partly because I had hinted that I was fed up, and we weren‚Äôt sure I‚Äôd stay in the area long-term, so our future was uncertain. I was upset that he seemed so ready to leave unlike me, and even though we continued talking, I broke up with him when I felt I needed someone more committed. I later regretted it and asked to try again. He agreed, and for a while things seemed better.

There was a calm and loving period. He asked me to meet his family and clearly wanted to try seriously and include me in his life. But then we had another fight where I felt hurt again, walked away, and eventually blocked him. I didnt want to breakup just that he understands that he was hurting me and needed to make more of an effort emotionally. Like we would have a great period and good conversations and if he gets angry abt smth, everything is lost. He reached out again after the block, but with kept talking abt the doubts, saying he didn‚Äôt really feel strong feelings for me anymore. I was ready to forgive and try again, but I couldn‚Äôt be the only one still fighting for us. I broke up with him in tears. He seemed to have wanted me to do it. 

We ended up going on a pre-planned trip together shortly after, and the confusion between being ‚Äútogether‚Äù or not while also missing each other and reigniting some of the feelings, created more tension. The tension and some of my reactions with this weird situation ended with him saying he was done for good. He said I always leave when overwhelmed, and that we‚Äôll always fight. That the fights had drained him, and that he didn‚Äôt feel strongly enough anymore.

Now I‚Äôm stuck wondering: Did I ruin it by being too emotional, or did he give up too quickly?

He knew how much I cared. I did my best to help him understand I had emotional needs, not just practical ones, he treated me well in theory, that's the problem, being polite bringing me gifts, making me food, but when I was trying to bring my authentic self, it didnt work, I just asked for some careful handling of my emotions as i was very very adn still am very attached, He told me he disagrees, that the relationship should feel easy from the start because it only gets harder over time. Whereas I was thinking it's an investment and it's be better after. 

I‚Äôm struggling to move on because I keep asking myself, what really happened? did I miss smth? Would love some perspective or advice.",whynot183,1760316209.0,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o55o81/dont_understand_why_it_ended_like_that/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o55o81/dont_understand_why_it_ended_like_that/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o55gb9,How do people that dated someone with a undiagnosed mental health problems,"My ex and I dated for about a year. I tried my best. She was diagnosed from a hard episode after the break up cause she was drinking hard and she was hurting herself and had a knife on hand. I loved hours ago. She was send to the hospital and she was diagnosed with BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder). 

 I was always there for her. She know i been figthing with depressing and how I act and say things due to my depression.  
She did blocked me and now we have no contact. I know she is in a new relationship and she did hook up with someone else just after the break up. And thats one of the things people with BPD do. It hurt me and I cant get that go because she did ask to get back together after she hook up with the other guy and didnt work out with him. 
Now I'm blocked and we have no contact. I did contacted her a while back and I know now she is in a relationship.  
Of curse now she know she has BPD and how to handle it. Also has medication 

But while we dated it was undiagnosed and I tried my best. And she does not see that side of me. That I was trying my best even she had such a big problem and we did not know. 

How did you handle people with undiagnosed problems? Did they apologized? Did they know how much harder was for you because it was undiagnosed.  Or they just still made you our the vilan and blocked you and moved on with their life's and maybe be in a better relationship because now they have the proper help and proper ways to handle their problems.

Me(22M) and my ex(21F) were together for 6 years and were both each others first time we moved in with other when we were 18 and things were going well until about a month ago we had some disagreements over some pretty serious stuff and decided we would be better as just friends. But we just renewed our lease so we‚Äôre both here until that is over with since paying to break it would cost WAY too much money

I started going to school and me and this girl started flirting with each other. She is beautiful and a great person (so the attraction is there) Last week we were at her house to study and let me just say we‚Äôre probably going to fail this upcoming test. We started making out and we were dry humping and when it came time to go into the bed room I couldn‚Äôt get it up it was getting there a little bit enough to start but after like 2 minutes it just fell back down. I was really embarrassed and she knows about my situation and was VERY understanding but next week we‚Äôre going on a ‚Äúdate‚Äù and I think afterwards will probably go back to her house and I want to give her a different experience than the one prior. 

My ex girlfriend and I don‚Äôt connect sexually or physically but I do get boners when I‚Äôm around her sometimes so ED hasn‚Äôt really been a problem, is it just too soon?? Should I pack a condom next week or just leave it at home??

1o556h6,I stumbled early in my relationship and it still haunts me ‚Äî first time navigating modern dating.,"Hi Reddit,

I‚Äôm 23 and this was my first real healthy adult relationship. When I started getting in to the dating pool, it was all new ‚Äî new country, new people, zero experience. I met two guys around the same time, but one of them (let‚Äôs call him Boy 1) was sweet and persistent. He liked me first and treated me with so much warmth and consistency that I eventually fell in love with him. I liked Boy 2 more at the start because our chemistry was instant but I realised later on how shallow that connection was. 

But here‚Äôs where I stumbled: I slept with the other guy the day after Boy 1 asked me to be his girlfriend (2 months after we met). Not because I wanted to. I wanted to see Boy 2 one more time to cut things off but he guilt tripped me into sleeping with him. I felt like crap for caving in and while I still had residual feelings for him, I didn‚Äôt even enjoy it. For about three weeks, I was conflicted and scared. I‚Äôd never been in a situation like that before. Within that same month, I made my decision ‚Äî I cut the other guy off completely, blocked him, and committed to Boy 1. A month into the relationship (about 3 months in since we met), I confessed what happened to Boy 1 because I wanted honesty between us, not secrets.

Boy 1 forgave me. For nearly two years, we built a relationship full of laughter, growth, and deep love. But recently, his brother dug up what happened almost two years later and told their parents. What followed was humiliating ‚Äî I was suddenly treated like my early mistake defined my worth. Boy 1 didn‚Äôt stand up for me, and his family judged me based on a distorted version of my past.

It hurts, because I‚Äôve done nothing but love him faithfully since. I‚Äôve grown, healed, and learned that integrity isn‚Äôt about never messing up ‚Äî it‚Äôs about what you do after you realise you have.

I guess I‚Äôm sharing this because I want to know: can love still be real and pure even if it started messy and human? Can people move beyond a stumble when the rest of the story was full of sincerity and heart? Am I a horrible cheater? I‚Äôm having such a hard time forgiving myself.

1o554yg,Thoughts,"Just to dive back into my feelings again. I think a soulmate would not break up with you. Or if they did, time will bring you two back together. I think that if a relationship or someone is worth it, you will be willing to work on the ups and downs. If a partner needs space in a relationship, give it to them. I am trying to give space as well even after the break up, so I get that it‚Äôs hard. I think that if you continuously finding yourself in toxic relationships, sit down with yourself why. If one person is will to break cycles for you and create a healthier attachment, is it still toxic? Also, hate to break it to you, but it takes two people to tango and not one person is scotch free. I think that people should have their own hobbies and to not expect their partner to do everything together. I‚Äôm just so tired connecting with someone and then stepping away when shit gets hard. If you say you‚Äôre my soulmate, act like it. Yk? It‚Äôs very hard for me to knock down walls. So if I‚Äôm fighting for you, I care.

1o54z9m,I need help. I want to kms. This is my second big break up with someone and its completely messing me up.,So Ive been with this girl for 3 years. We each have 2 kids. She was just letting my kids pick out their rooms at the place we were getting together. She was begging me to not give up on us and saying something was trying to break us up. However she had cheat on me a lot over the course of 2 years and while she told me on her own and had her location on and was really showing change. I became abusive when she had slipped up with her girlbestfriend and at first she said she needed that to know I wasnt playing. I became worse over little stuff and next thing I know Im hitting her like I would fight a dude and shes got a busted lip. She thought a demon was in me and her ptsd from my abusive manifested for her in that way. But I had repent and fell to my knees to her and swore it wouldnt ever happen again and over the next few days she had took my kids with her to see a few new places. (No my kids were not around when we fought or ever seen us argue) but we were doing really really good and both had changed a lot. But one day she left to get clothes from her mom for her grandma cause sshe thought she was neglectin her. She went to get the clothes and everything changed and she started treating me like complete shit and she kept saying I could stay and then would go outside to leave and her mom would tell her to go in there and get the keys and she just kept going back and forth until she eventually just wanted me gone even though we still had 20 days to move. She wont talk to me or anything and its breaking my heart. I know there was no reason to get physical and she said she felt safe with me and could tell I was sorry andbreally was changing. What happened for her to switch up like that instead of just telling me she wanted to break up with me on her own?

1o54vpu,message from ex,"Guys, I come after months of my first post (I think in March/April) to say how embarrassing it was all this time... well, I was fine these weeks, and in the meantime a lot of things happened, including some unexpected rapprochements (good ones by the way) and separations in the same way, we last stayed in July and since we broke up we had never hooked up again, but after July and myself seeing that I was falling into the same cycle of hope/illusion I decided to leave on my own. out/stop waiting for her because months ago when we were talking about the relationship she herself said that she didn't know if it was healthy for us to continue seeing each other because she didn't know what she wanted, well... weeks later when I really decided to move on she kept sending messages here and there, you know? Things like ‚ÄúI know‚Äù or ‚Äúif you were with me you wouldn't want to go out like that‚Äù and I was focused on going out, I responded politely and continued... now 1 month after no contact, she came back with a lot of hate saying that she didn't like me, that she felt repulsed because they were going to tell her that I had hooked up with a teenager, I'm actually 31 and the girl is 16 (it could be really ugly) but I myself said that I wasn't proud and that nothing big happened, but she kept saying that she felt angry and that I should wake up to life and being embarrassed to interact with people my age (she is currently 20), detail that I was blocked on all networks and she came, unblocked me and sent all this and blocked again.
This made me feel so bad, I've been thinking about it for a week now, and what makes me angry is that I was already ‚Äúfine‚Äù accepting it, why did she come back and say that?

1o54txc,Closure.,"I cheated on my now ex. 
It stemmed from her losing my trust early in the relationship, kissing a guy behind my back. 
I tried to leave her when it happened but she begged me to stay. I couldn‚Äôt stand her tears, to see her broken, I couldn‚Äôt leave her like that..

I told her I wasn‚Äôt going to be good, I told her she broke my trust, and that it wasn‚Äôt going to end well. I didn‚Äôt know how bad it would turn out to be though, for both of us. 

I tried to fake it after like I was okay but deep down I didn‚Äôt feel right, I couldn‚Äôt act like everything was okay, when I didn‚Äôt trust her anymore. I had given my time and sacrificed valuable time to be with her for her to then do that.. I couldn‚Äôt shake it. I wish I could, truly, but at the time it just ate me up. 

I eventually turned to drinking and being out all the time, I started working night shifts down town, because deep down I couldn‚Äôt stand to be around her, faking it anymore. 
It was cowardly.

Over time I lost my focus on what made me, me.
I wasn‚Äôt working out anymore, I wasn‚Äôt partaking in my hobbies, I just wanted to hit the bottle and party. 
After a while harder party favors came into play, and from then on my life came crashing down, I lost everything, I became more than numb, careless and disgusting. It‚Äôs hard to believe how out of touch I was. 

It‚Äôs hard to believe how I didn‚Äôt care anymore, how I lost my confidence and ability to want anything good, I just wanted to die.

I almost died a few times. 

3 years into the relationship (4weeks ago)
She looked through my phone and found a lot of things I‚Äôm ashamed of.

She had turned into a great girlfriend after that stuff in the beginning, but I was already too far gone to see, too numb to care and then too depressed and beaten by the drugs to turn things around. 

She went crazy, it turned into the most depressing thing I‚Äôve ever been through. I stayed with her because I never wanted to hurt her, but now I hurt her more than I can imagine. 
I have nightmares about it every night.
It‚Äôs truly something I wouldn‚Äôt wish on my worst enemy. 

When I got sober, the realization of everything hit me, which was even more depressing, and hard to cope with. 

We didn‚Äôt talk for about a week after she kicked me out, then I went to her place and we had sex, it was the best sex we had in over a year. We enjoyed each other, we laughed, we cuddled, she told me she loved me. 

Then she grew cold shortly after, telling me it wouldn‚Äôt work, to which I did not react well, I freaked out, I begged I pleaded, I did everything and said everything I could to stop her. 

We had contact little by little until tonight. 
Tonight I told her if she didn‚Äôt see it ever working to tell me, because I love her so much, and I would never stop trying unless she said so. 

So she did. And she‚Äôs gone for now. 

Is all hope lost? What do I do? 
I‚Äôm in love with her. 
I‚Äôm 30. This isn‚Äôt puppy love. This is my best friend. The person I want to spend my life with. 

 She was reluctant to say it. But she said yes to my question ‚Äúso you don‚Äôt see us ever being together again?‚Äù

Ran into her at restaurant yesterday when I was celebrating birthday.  Talked briefly, she was with her rebound and was cold.. didn't even say happy birthday. I was on no contact but kind of hoped to hear back something from her because I got her birthday gift in August. 

Sad, but also was happy seeing her face because I missed it very much.

My ex is an anxious attachment, and I am the avoidant. They currently want space, but I‚Äôm trying to find solutions. Yeah, I am 100% aware that I have been more clingy since the breakup ended triggered my abandonment issues. I understand that I was unhealthy and I since apologized, and obviously a putting in the work to create more stable habits. I think that when I needed space I was not given it (during the relationship). I would be open to being friends, but I‚Äôm worried that past feelings will arise. Especially since it was so abrupt. They want to move on, but be friends. I am trying to explain to them that if we are friends, the cycle could potentially continue if we do not work on our attachment styles. I know being friends with an ex can be difficult, especially because if either of us find someone new, it would almost seem toxic not to end the friendship. I suggested being friends multiple times in the relationship to prevent so much pressure and to allow us to get to know each other a bit more.

I‚Äôm 25F and my ex is 29M. We were together for about five months, and from the very beginning he told everyone, his friends and family, that I was the one. He was so certain. He said I was everything he‚Äôd been looking for, that he had never laughed this much or been able to be his true self with anyone else. He constantly told me that everything was perfect and that I was the best partner someone could ask for. Up until last week, we were still talking about our future together.

Then almost overnight, things shifted. He said that even though everything was perfect, he felt like we were missing a spark or some undeniable sign that this was where he was meant to be. That uncertainty grew until he told me he couldn‚Äôt undo the web of doubt he had created in his own head, and that led to the breakup.

What makes this harder is that he‚Äôs done this before. Earlier in our relationship, he pulled away for similar reasons, saying he needed space and wasn‚Äôt sure what he wanted. Later, he came back and told me that no one compared to me, that I had set the standard, and that no one gave him the same depth or comfort.

When we talked this time, he cried and said he loved me but that he wasn‚Äôt the man I deserved. He said he needed to be alone for a while and that I deserved kindness. He told me I‚Äôd taught him so much about himself and admitted that he had never really taken time to be alone before.

We hugged for a long time before I left, neither of us wanting to let go, and it didn‚Äôt feel final. It felt like two people who still loved each other but couldn‚Äôt get past his internal struggle.

He has an avoidant attachment style and tends to retreat when things get too real. I think the deeper things got, the more it scared him. My gut keeps telling me this isn‚Äôt truly over, but I‚Äôm trying to move forward while also accepting that it might be.

Do you think he will come back or am I just being delusional? And what do I do in the meantime. 

TL;DR: Dated for five months. He told everyone I was the one and said everything was perfect, that I was the best partner he‚Äôd ever had. Then he suddenly said we were missing a spark, that he couldn‚Äôt undo the web of uncertainty in his head, and broke up with me even though nothing went wrong. He has an avoidant attachment style and has done this before, only to return later. I still feel like it isn‚Äôt over, but I‚Äôm trying to move on.

1o54dbt,Became we incompatible?,"I (M27F) have been with my girlfriend (27F) ~3.5 years (living together ~2.5). We share core values and she‚Äôs kind and reliable, but there‚Äôs a structural mismatch. She lives with depression/ADHD/social anxiety and feels safest with routine, lots of shared time, and an engagement; I need closeness with real autonomy‚Äîsolo time without guilt, lightness, activity, and social energy. My needs have changed throughout our relationship, as I became more confident.Our evenings feel repetitive; my ‚Äúno‚Äù to common thing easily lands as rejection; she cant be alone when I‚Äôm away for work or with friends. money styles clash and in conflict she often emotionalizes while I avoid arguing for my position due to her beeing not that stable, and then resent it. Net result: the relationship drains more than it fuels me, and I don‚Äôt feel an inner yes to getting engaged. Outside the relationship I‚Äôve grown and want a partner who has interests/friends besides me, and thus beeing not to reliant towards me. I‚Äôm therefore leaning toward a respectful breakup, but as it is my first real relationship I am very much struggling with the Step, because it feels wrong and Right at the same time and tears me apart.

1o53w3h,First real breakup and it sucks,"Hi! I would be really grateful for any advice and/or opinions, I'm yet to figure anything out. I thought I started getting better, then had a week long break from uni and it crashed down badddd, now I feel like a sensitive baby:((

That was my first serious relationship. I've dated a couple of people before, mostly online, and it felt bad when it ended but I also was a teen so it's just youth and emotion, nothing scarring.

This one, however, started when I was twenty one and lasted for almost two years. I've never loved someone as hard and have never been so hopeful before. I have some mental health issues so I generally struggle to picture my future but I was able to do such with her. I thought about how we would have our fun mundane life together. Matched so well from the beginning, it was amazing. She was my first kiss, and I can't stop thinking about it now. Ugh.

Then I went to study abroad and we slowly but surely lost touch with one another. Both tried to be there for each other, both tried to engage in something fun together, played games, made calls. But I didn't know how to support her in a way that would be helpful (because I'm an anxious avoidant coward and she's very confident) ‚Äî that was one of the main points she brought up when breaking up with me.

Well, that happened and after I begged some, she said it's technically possible for us to get back together one day when I've matured some more and separated from my parents. Then she got into another relationship only a month later, with a person she became good friends with when we were still dating. They also were in a serious gay relationship so it was pretty fun until I realized it was kind of the push she needed to start drifting away from me because they two clicked so well.

I felt insanely insecure about it until the breakup happened because they made her so happy when two of them talked and absolutely devastated when they had issues (that person's girlfriend was jealous as well so they had to stop talking but noticeably craved each other's company.) I tried to believe her when she honestly explained everything to me, so it was still blindsiding when she broke up with me half a year ago. Well, exactly as I expected, they got together and she seems happier now than she was with me. She's talking about feeling bad about ""settling for something less than that"" before. It should make me happy in a bittersweet way since I wish the best for her ‚Äî but it just hurts so bad.

I know it technically was emotional cheating but I can't blame her for it, I understand everyone deserves to be with someone they're completely happy with and I know she genuinely didn't realize these feelings were romantic until later. But I hurts so bad. My emotions switch between guilt for making her feel alone and thus pushing her away, embarrassment for confessing my feeling too early and creating this situation, despair about being so unlovable, contempt for her dragging it out for so long when she was feeling weird, anger at both me and her and her new partner, pity for myself, weird ideations, the list is long. I was constantly in the state of derealization when it happened and it keeps happening sometimes. It feels like it weighs on my insides like lead when I think about her six months after. I want her as a friend at least, she's one of the only friends I've had ‚Äî but she says we weren't even able to become genuine friends through the relationship we've had. Now we're low contact (it hurts me to talk to her even though I want to stay friends) and I miss her so much. 

Do you think anyone's at fault based on this information? Do you have any tips to help letting go of the situation?

1o53o63,"My ex cheated, lied, and got engaged 3 weeks after our breakup of 4 year relationship. I‚Äôm not seeking closure, just understanding.","I (25F, Indian) was with my ex (29M) for over four years. We met during the pandemic and built what I thought was a deep, committed relationship. He told me I was his soulmate, that he wanted to marry me, and we even talked about our future together. I introduced him to my parents, which was a huge deal culturally for me, and I had a lot of fights with them trying to fight for my relationship with him and for their acceptance.

Throughout our relationship, there was always an issue with his girl best friend. They were emotionally close in a way that made me uncomfortable for years. They texted constantly, shared personal things, and had an intimacy that blurred lines. Whenever I expressed discomfort, he‚Äôd reassure me it was platonic, or promise to create boundaries, but he never really did.

Last December, 2 months before our 4 year anniversary, something happened that broke my trust completely. He got drunk at his work Christmas party and couple days later confessed that he had done something inappropriate with that he had texted his girl best friend ‚ÄúI love you and I wanna be with you‚Äù while he was drunk. He said he didn‚Äôt remember much, that he didn‚Äôt have feelings for her, and that it was a mistake. I was devastated, but he begged for forgiveness and said he‚Äôd do anything to fix it. He told me he‚Äôd cut her off completely, and I decided to give him one last chance.

From January to April, things seemed to be getting better slowly. He was attentive, saying all the right things, and trying to rebuild what we lost. But in April, while I was back home for 3 weeks for a family emergency and a week before coming back to the UK he ended things with me over a phone call. He was vague about the reasons why he wanted to break up but I accepted it and agreed to break up.

The day after he broke up with me, he called asking if we could try couples therapy and see if we could work things out. I was confused but hopeful, only for him to later go silent. 

Two months after the breakup I hear from mutual friends that he had actually cheated on me again in April when I was away for those 3 weeks. This time, with his coworker, someone he directly manages at work. This coworker has also in the past hooked up with his brother (earlier this year). I found out later through mutual friends that they had slept together while I was gone, and that he started seeing her immediately after. Within three weeks of ending things with me, he got engaged to the girl he cheated on me with. This was the same man who used to tell me I was the love of his life, who cried at the thought of losing me, who said he wanted to build a life with me. He got married to her in August.

It‚Äôs been 6 months now. I‚Äôve healed a lot and I don‚Äôt want anything to do with that man anymore. But Im curious and trying to make sense of his behavior. How do you go from calling someone your soulmate and begging for another chance to getting engaged to someone new in just three weeks? Was our entire relationship a lie? Was he just emotionally weak, avoidant, guilty, or is this a sign of something deeper like narcissism or emotional immaturity? Was he a sociopath? Can someone who has done anything similar please reply and give me some insight? Will he regret this and does he think about me?

I‚Äôm not looking for closure from him. I just want to understand what kind of mindset drives someone to betray, lie, and move on that fast, especially after years of shared love and plans for a future.

TL;DR:
My ex (29M) and I (25F) were together for 4 years. He had an emotionally inappropriate friendship with his girl best friend, once crossed the line with her while drunk, and later cheated on me with a coworker he manages while I was travelling back home for a family illness emergency. The day after breaking up with me, he asked to try couples therapy, then went silent and got engaged to the woman he cheated with 3 weeks later.

1o53flr,I'm struggling so bad,"So my partner of 4 years and I broke up officially back in early July but we continued on and off talking and hooking up until 3 weeks ago today. Too much detail to go into, but long story short, I made a lot of very stupid decisions and said a lot of stupid things in our relationship. Even more so after we broke things off. The only time I've heard from her was when she told me 2 weeks ago out of nowhere over text that she wished she could talk to me but didn't want to negatively affect my mental health and then she blocked me again. I'm blocked on every possible avenue to contact her so I have no way to try again. 

Today is my birthday, it's the first birthday I've spent in almost 20 years without a partner. I don't do dating, so all of my relationships have been at bare minimum a year with this one that just ended being over 4 years. I planned this weekend away while we were still on and off seeing each other because for once my birthday fell on a Sunday and we could have spent the whole weekend away together. I chose to maintain the plans even though we're no longer in contact, stupidly hoping she'd at the very least reach out say happy birthday and maybe at the very least talk to me. I was wrong. Now I'm sitting here alone, in a hotel room, trying to keep my mind off the fact that she hates me so much that the day is basically over and she didn't say anything to me. I can't drink as I physically can't get drunk, I just get the hangover, I don't smoke as I have a bad reaction to drugs, and I have no real friends to go out with. So I'm sitting here alone and miserable. 

I hate this, I can't get over my feelings, I can't stop thinking about her, and I'm sick of even wasting my time with relationships if they're just going to keep leaving me because I'm human and I have mental issues that I'm getting help for. I don't care for dating or casual sex. I literally feel nauseous even considering sleeping with someone other than her. I don't have any idea what to do and I hate it. I'm struggling so much to not have dark thoughts because it's selfish and does nothing but hurt the few people in this life that I actually care about. But I just wish she would actually reach out and show me that yes, she's hurting, but she still cares, at least a little.

So for context the only thing they really did was she gave him head and that was it, My boyfriend at the time felt weird because she was in an open relationship and thought it would create some tension between them.

I didn‚Äôt know really how to feel at the time but after hearing that he thought about her while we were intimate made me feel sick. So one day we were both kind of tired (and more so him since he has some sort of tired health issues that he‚Äôs trying to figure out) but still wanted to have sex, we ended up starting to feel up each other and you can guess where that leads. But right after he finishes and we‚Äôre cuddling he says ‚ÄúI think porn is bad for me‚Äù And right then I had a hunch that something was going through his mind, then I said ‚ÄúWhat makes you say that? ‚Äú He goes ‚ÄúI just feel bad like when I can‚Äôt finish I have to turn to porn or past experiences‚Äù and after this I can‚Äôt really remember what I said but we got to the point where he said that he had thought about that other girl in such a quick way like it was something to brush over, And holy shit my heart sank so fast. He kept saying ‚ÄúI think when I‚Äôm tired it‚Äôs harder for me to finish‚Äù But couldn‚Äôt he just stopped having sex if that‚Äôs where he‚Äôs minds going? I don‚Äôt know what I would do if I were him but I feel like that‚Äôs emotional cheating. There were other things about her which rubbed me the wrong way, Like when her and her partner broke up he would comfort her in a way he‚Äôs never comforted me before. Mind you he didn‚Äôt know her before he was friends with the partner and met through them. But I was there for him while he was confessing this to me, Making sure he was listened to and not judged. But whenever my emotions came out I was rushed and made felt like that my issues weren‚Äôt that big. Like for example, I had to give away my cat since my landlords weren‚Äôt wanting a cat in the apartment, And so when It came to finally giving him away I was just in shambles. I came to him crying and he didn‚Äôt seem to care. He was on his phone and being very dismissive and just saying it‚Äôs gonna be okay in such an ‚Äúi want to get this over with‚Äù type attitude and nothing else. So I just felt like this distance between me and him, but it‚Äôs not like he doesn‚Äôt know how to comfort someone. He does, and his mum has shown and modelled it to him before. So why wasn‚Äôt I worth it to him? It just take me back to If i wasn‚Äôt worth it to him, then he‚Äôs just gonna go back to that girl.


Now that we‚Äôve broken up, I‚Äôm terrified at the thought of him just going to her to get what he finally wanted, because he was so quick to let me go when we broke up it just says to me you were waiting to get with her? 

Im not sure what to do at the moment. I think Im just seeking out different perspectives on this whole situation and just want some comfort through it.

1o52zrd,My ex (26M)was secretly getting married for a green card while dating me(F24),"I (24F) was in a relationship for about a year with a guy (26M) who‚Äôs not from the U.S. Everything seemed fine until I left for Europe ‚Äî and then I found out through another girl‚Äôs VSCO that he was seeing her too.

When I confronted him, he admitted that he was with her because of a green card deal and that he couldn‚Äôt post her anywhere because his family follows him and might ask questions. He also told me she knows about the arrangement but is scared of possible consequences if anything came out.

He said he was paying her a lot and begged me not to interfere or text her. I wanted to warn her at first, but he said it would ‚Äúruin everything.‚Äù I went no contact after that, but it‚Äôs been almost a year now and I still think about the situation a lot.

Lately, I‚Äôve been having this strong urge to do something ‚Äî not necessarily out of revenge, but to get closure and a sense of justice. These are the thoughts that keep looping in my head:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Text the girl and show her the evidence, let her decide what to do.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Tell his brother (he said his brother doesn‚Äôt know about it) and send screenshots.

I know I sound obsessed, but this whole experience really messed with me emotionally. I‚Äôve never been lied to this deeply, and I feel like I never got closure.

üëâ My question: Should I just let it go and focus on healing, or should I act on one of these thoughts so I can finally move on?

TL;DR:
I (24F) found out my ex (26M, not from the U.S.) was getting married for a green card while dating me. He said the other girl knows but is scared of consequences.

1o52xzt,What should I do to get her F 22 back ?,"Hey everyone,
My ex F 22 and I M 23 were together for almost 3 years. She broke up with me over a year ago. The main reason was that I wasn't active enough for her. I didn't give her the experiences, trips, or adventures she wanted.

Before we met and at the beginning of our relationship i was the active one. I was always did something with friends and wanted to do this and that. But with time i did less and less, l became lazy. I was in a comfort zone trap if you could say that. I thought i had everything and this was enough but I forgot about her. Did she want me to be like this. Was this also enough for her. For some people it is enough to just chill at home and watch something and cuddle most of the time. But for her not anymore, she became more active and i was stuck. And I tried but i couldn't, at least not fast enough. And she is the type she knows it takes time but also wants to move forward, have people in life that help her live the life she wants. And I couldn't. So at some point she ended it. We talked it out and ended on good terms. We also had contact for a while after.

Since the breakup, l've worked a lot on myself:
I've taken more responsibility, stepped out of my comfort zone, traveled alone, reconnected with old friends, and had new experiences. I feel like I've grown and become the man I wasn't back then. But not really just for her, of course I still tried because I wanted her back, but I also wanted my old self back. Where I am from you have to do military service. And it really helped me get out of my comfort zone.
Because you have to do things even if you don't want, but everything if you looked back was fun, a nice experience and so on. And eventually I made something I never thought I would do. A solo trip. And not so long after I did another one. It was also nice to be around many people again. I made new friends, i also do more with old friends now again.

I still love her deeply and want her back in my life.I don't want to text or call her, I want to speak to her in person. I want to be honest without pressuring her. The problem is, I don't know how to act. How can I make her see that I've changed and that I still care, without overwhelming her? How can I slowly rebuild contact ?",Correct-Ferret6071,1760308582.0,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o52xzt/what_should_i_do_to_get_her_f_22_back/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o52xzt/what_should_i_do_to_get_her_f_22_back/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o52x00,"I‚Äôm trying to recover, but I‚Äôm not sure what to do next","FOREWORD: This is a bit of a long story and I veer off slightly, but I‚Äôm finding it really hard to recover from a breakup that maybe I should‚Äôve by now? I‚Äôd be grateful for any responses, you ain‚Äôt gotta be an expert. Thank you. 

We were going out for a year and a half. It‚Äôs been about 9 months since we broke up, although we were still talking and meeting up for about another 3 months afterwards. 

We ended it amicably, we just realised that there was stuff I needed to work on and I was hurting her emotionally and I hated that I was the one doing it. She also felt like I wasn‚Äôt exactly the type of man that she‚Äôd imagined she‚Äôd be with either and that played on my mind a lot. But we really did love each other, we had good foundations: support, honesty, accountability, intimacy, vulnerability, care & friendship (granted there was a few times I should‚Äôve respected her better but over 90% of the time, things were great). We‚Äôre still young (23M, 21F) and it was her first real relationship and my first one where things genuinely felt right and loving. 

I still feel so guilty about it all, especially since I kinda know it was my fault. The last 4 months of the relationship things fell apart because of one big argument that led to a break (not really maintained) & then little things that I was or wasn‚Äôt doing after we made amends. I just feel so bad that I failed a beautiful soul like her, and failed both of us bc I f**ked up a good thing. I feel like I failed myself in some ways, I still struggle a lot with who I am vs who I wanna be. I know and feel there‚Äôs something beautiful and almost perfect buried underneath all the depression, anger, self-loathing & anxiety. But it feels so hard to tap into sometimes, especially since all this exacerbates it

In the summer we had a brief chat over text, she said she didn‚Äôt resent me at all. That we could be friends one day but wasn‚Äôt ready for that (I‚Äôm still not either). And that did make me feel better, but I still just hate that it‚Äôs come to this, and if you put the blame on me you‚Äôd probably be right. 

We haven‚Äôt blocked each other and sometimes I view her profile when I get lonely (I know I shouldn‚Äôt, but I miss her and we‚Äôd always talk about each how others day went). Recently I saw a story post where it seemed like she was soft-launching a new man, the camera was looking down at their feet and he wasn‚Äôt stood hella close, but he had flowers and what looked like a new bag in his hands (it wasn‚Äôt exactly a woman‚Äôs bag) with the caption ‚Äúbodyguard x‚Äù. Now it could‚Äôve been one of her friends I‚Äôve met before or her brother. But it doesn‚Äôt take Sherlock Holmes to read between the lines here. And I‚Äôm not really one to speculate because it doesn‚Äôt change anything. I‚Äôm not super jealous if it‚Äôs true, it just hurts coz my gut tells me it‚Äôs been easier for her to move on. And it makes me feel worse about myself because if she can do it, why do I still struggle with it so much? I‚Äôm not saying I need to find a new partner, I just need to love myself. 

I don‚Äôt exactly know what to do anymore, I‚Äôve tried taking myself out on solo dates. Treating myself, doing things I wanna do/interested in, reading, finally starting to commit to a workout routine, trying to stay consistent with meditation, trying my best to still see friends even though I get reclusive. I know the process is slow, but it doesn‚Äôt really feel like it‚Äôs working. I wish people would just ask me about her, I spend so much of my day thinking about it and her still. I don‚Äôt get why it‚Äôs taboo, breakups are really common even if they are all unique. I wish that I could just tell people without feeling like I‚Äôm dumping my emotional baggage on them and being a drag. I don‚Äôt want a pity party but it feels like I‚Äôm just left to deal with it on my own and I‚Äôm finding it really hard. 

I don‚Äôt know if the next step is therapy, it feels like a small thing to go to therapy over. Plus it‚Äôs expensive and who knows how long I‚Äôm going to need it for. But I do struggle with my mental health as it is, and I‚Äôve been to therapy before when I was severely depressed as a teenager. I think I ended it too soon because I wanted to save my parents money. I also don‚Äôt want to be told that I might have anxiety too because dealing with one mental illness is hard enough. We dipped into it sometimes but we never fully deep dived into her mental health together because she doesn‚Äôt find it easy talking about that kinda stuff and I don‚Äôt prod, but she‚Äôs always managed to not let it affect her too much and carry on with her day. I think I let my mental health affect me a lot, I wish it didn‚Äôt and I do try but I find it harder. Although I‚Äôve always been able to talk pretty openly about it, especially when asked. I just wish I had her strength and diligence in that way. 

Do you ever meet someone and think ‚Äúyea, I think they might be the best I‚Äôll ever get‚Äù? I do, I can‚Äôt believe I still cling onto the idea that there‚Äôs a chance for us getting back together at the right time n place in life, even if it‚Äôs not soon. I think she‚Äôll always have the key to my heart in a way, but I fear I might‚Äôve lost the chance to hers. Kinda right person, wrong time idea you know? Do people ever get back together and it actually works? Please tell me if I‚Äôm deluded or too hopeful, but I really do love her even though I know I‚Äôm not supposed to. Deep down I still feel she has some love for me somewhere, but maybe that‚Äôs just a dream. 

I‚Äôm sorry for rambling so long and thank you so much to whoever‚Äôs read this far. Does anyone have any advice or suggestions?? even similar experiences are appreciated, I just don‚Äôt wanna feel so alone anymore and I need a bit of direction.

Even going lengths of never taking my phone calls ever. And I‚Äôll admit they‚Äôre were red flags I over looked and regret it big time. I‚Äôm currently in therapy and have been awhile and it‚Äôs helping me lots.

1o52s0x,advice for an ex that keeps coming back,"this story may be long as sometimes i really over explain things but i really just need to get all the details and most of this off my chest. i may delete it after a couple hours but idk at this point. 

i genuinely dont know what to do im starting to think i need some type of help. not that this situation is a bad thing but that idk what else to think, say or do.

--

for context me and this ex ended originally 2 or something years ago and have been on and off continuously ( will add more depth to that later ) since then. we ended on really good terms and still are on those said terms to this day. weve only gotten back together once which barely lasted several days.

anyways, im not sure how many times weve spoken on and off but im completely sure its more than 10+ times maybe even 15.

everytime i try to get into another relationship i just physically cannot do it. not because of him but because i dont feel like i can be loved ever again. even saying those words makes me feel genuinely pathetic. ive never been this vulnerable before which freaks me out in itself.

when we first originally broke up i was fully devastated as at the time i didnt know the original reason for said breakup ( i do now but i wont be mentioning that at all ) once i eventually got over it i was finally okay with myself and thought i could move on & work on my life and rebuild myself until i realised i wasnt able to do that. he texted me for the first time since the breakup & i was at a loss. i genuinely didnt know what to do with myself as i did genuinely miss him and still honestly do. 

that lasted around 3-4 days and i didnt hear from him for weeks and weeks. and as you can already guess it happened again, same time frame several times.

fast forward to around the 5-6th time we spoke again ( estimate ) it turnt out he was playing me as a joke for that one time. it fully turned me upside down as i thought it was real that time. it made me feel genuinely unlovable. it made me feel and think some things i dont really wanna get into right now. moral of that story is it really hurt me badly and i swore id never go back again incase that id have a repeat.

and then it did happen again. and again. and again. 

ever since then my life has literally never been the same & only just recently hes texted me again.

everytime i think im fully over the entirety of that relationship i get a text again. i seriously dont know what to do anymore. ive come to terms that this whole ordeal isnt anybodys fault but mine. i feel genuinely sick with myself.

ill add more details later as im honestly just tired. 

probably will delete this idk tho.",watermelonlover18_,1760308153.0,1,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o52s0x/advice_for_an_ex_that_keeps_coming_back/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o52s0x/advice_for_an_ex_that_keeps_coming_back/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o52kud,I don‚Äôt want to be with my pregnant girlfriend who‚Äôs due in 1 month.,"I know that sounds terrible and this whole entire mess is my own doing and I don‚Äôt blame her or anyone for my decisions I‚Äôm responsible for every decision I make. Long story short though, she cheated after we had our first baby and I never really processed it because I wanted to keep our family together and at the time I was very poor so my main focus was work. She said she cheated because she felt like I was ‚Äúout doing‚Äù her or making more money than her.

How does that correlate to cheating? I have no idea, I‚Äôve chased her through storms, literally and now I‚Äôm finally at a stable point in my life and I just don‚Äôt feel anything towards her anymore, it‚Äôs all so numb now and I think I was using money and my goals as a escape from my relationship we just got our first place and I‚Äôve been depressed the last few months. Then to make matters worse I meet someone who I actually have a lot in common with and it‚Äôs causing me to drift further away from her. 

I love my kid and I‚Äôm going to love the next one too, but I don‚Äôt know what to do about her, do I just continue faking like I still want to be with her in front of the kids?

1o52fms,"I'm devastated, and I know he is alright","It's been almost two weeks. He was my first love, and first everything. For him, I was just one more girl. I try not to stalk him, but I was weak now and did it. I blocked the URLs on my pc, but not on my phone. He is completely fine, possibly doing better than before. It hurts even more to see how little I meant for him after three years. Or two years, he didn't even treat me like his girlfriend for this whole third year, but he kept lying it was just me being insecure when I pointed it out. I feel like shit. I hate how he posts ""NEET gamer girls are the best"" now, but he was complaining about me being unemployed and useless not even a month ago. Talks about greasy hair being a good thing, but complained when I was two weeks without washing mine. He is already fantasizing about his perfect woman. He was for months, but he insisted it wasn't true when I was confronted him, and once again blamed my insecurity. It's very clear he was completely out of the relationship since January, that's why he is doing good while I'm still hurt and crying daily. I love him still. I meant nothing to him anymore, but he kept me close and used my feelings out of boredom. I don't know how to get over it, I'm truly devastated. I'm 29, and he was my first everything. It's not like I'm a teenager and my life is just starting. I'm an adult with very little life experiences compared to other people my age. I'm autistic and had no hope in ever dating, just for things to end this way when I had hope for the first time. I really regret ever being with him. I wish I was still a virgin. He said many cruel things to me before breaking up. I don't understand why. Why hurt me further if we would never talk again afterwards. And now he is alright, like I never meant anything to him. I know he is glad he finally got rid of me. I try to distract myself but his words and the reality of the situation keep returning to my head. I have no friends, I feel very lonely.

1o52b46,Maybe it's finally over.,"I had to break after 9 months because lots of stuff he was telling me just didn't add up.  He lied about quite a few things or what he tells me changed from day to day.  Even his relationships with his 2 baby mamas didn't add up which gave me the most anxiety.  I tried to break up with him but he was keep coming back.  I even blocked him and he bought another number to call me from while I was out of country on work trip.....

  
When I got back, he once again asked if we could go to dinner again.  I reluctantly agreed to see if that would stop him from continuing.  I think he is finally getting some help that he really needs and he is seeking at my direction to give him some intimacy or whatever and NOW he tells me some of the truth but at that point, I just didn't care.  I was just so sick of all the bullshit especially since one of the biggest problem I had was that I never knew where he slept every night while refusing to stay over....and then he turns around and says that he doesn't know where I sleep every night since I travel so much for work.  I really didn't even know how to respond to that.  He's literally comparing me going on work trips to him ""couch surfing"" (including possibly sleeping over at one of his baby mama's)....I told him please don't contact me again since this is getting ridiculous.

1o525l2,breakup update: 11 months later,"I dated a beautiful man almost a year ago and had the most insane whirlwind romance. At the time when it was happening, all of the fireworks and intimacy and dopamine and adventures made me feel like I was in my own personal rom com. It was unbelievable. We thought and said to each other ""this is the one"". We said I love you after 2 weeks and became official after 3 . He was the first man to ever tell me that I was the love of his life, and express serious desire towards having a long term future with me where we would grow old together. He told me I was his best friend. I still remember the absolute ecstasy when I was in it and the juxtaposition of the last 3 months of our relationship where the dream came crashing down.

Long story short, even though it felt magical, all of that rushed urgent romance that I expressed earlier was textbook lovebombing. I hate to say that in retrospect, if something seems too good to be true, it probably is. Not because I don't think true love and all of the positives with it are real, but at the rate of which our relationship progressed, we simply did not know each other. And as we spent more time together, I realized that we had fundamental incompatibilities that didn't come up as obviously when we were so engulfed in each other earlier in the new relationship. He was insecure, manic, and flat out abusive. It took me so long to accept that the dream had turned into a nightmare because I was still on the high of how good it was when it first started, and I never wanted to judge him for ""one mistake"" that quickly turned to multiple instances of intentional harm. I was constantly contorting logic and details to justify behavior that otherwise would have been unacceptable to me. Until finally after we got home from a trip to see his family, in a state I had never been too, thousands of miles away from my friends and family and totally reliant on him, he totally betrayed me and made me have a panic attack. It was the first time I was genuinely afraid of him, and I realized that he was a person that was unsafe because he was comfortable with saying things only for the purpose of hurting me. It made me lose respect for him. The relationship ended shortly after I tried to ignore this reality that was staring back at me wherever I went. I wish I had left the relationship more valiantly and I had gotten the cathartic satisfaction of telling him everything that I know now, but it didn't end that way. He broke up with me when I was at my most vulnerable in an incredibly cruel way, leaving me in pieces-- looking back, the signs that he would do something like this were clear as day. I was devastated right at the start of one of the coldest winters since my childhood. I literally had never felt so empty.

Almost a full year later, through several sessions of therapy, journaling, reflection, days of darkness, pouring into other relationships that I had left unattended while I was in the rapture, and enough tears to fill the sea, I finally have started to feel like myself again. I'm definitely not the same person I was at the beginning, middle, or end of that relationship. I had to fight to regain my passion and my spark. I had to fight to come out off depressive episodes and cancelling plans, work, self care. I'm surely more jaded, but I'm also more independent. And in the same hand, I've never felt more connected to my community than I do now. I am weathered, but also stronger. I've accomplished so much alone. I still have bad days and I'd be lying if I said that I don't still think about my ex-- when we first broke up, I prayed he would come crawling back to me and now I pray that I never see or hear from him ever again. My feelings of yearning have changed to feelings of disgust and distain. I am still working on this, because even this is giving him too much space in my heart and brain still. He's not worthy of my negative thoughts,  even my hate. But I know I will reach indifference and true healing with more time. I look forward to my progress and I know I'll feel even better this time next year.

I remember coming to this thread freshly heartbroken, and I felt like my heart was outside of my body. I felt like I was an alien and I was dying (dramatic but true). I felt like people could smell it on me, and I felt pathetic. I felt like a failure. I'm here to tell anyone at any stage on their healing journey that it DOES get better, and you deserve to inhabit spaces that inspire you to grow and expand, not spaces that attempt to keep you weak and small. Rejection is truly redirection, and something that is truly made for you will not come with a villainous level of self abandonment and pain. It will get better, and you will change. Do NOT give up, and let the time, pain, love, loss, and joy, wash over you.

1o51fu2,‚ÄúWhy Did My Ex Treat Me So Cruelly If He Still Says He Can‚Äôt Move On?‚Äù,"My Story

My ex (24M) and I (25F) recently broke up. He told me that he still feels sad when he talks to me because he hasn‚Äôt fully moved on. He also said that he‚Äôs dating someone new , he likes her but doesn‚Äôt love her yet and isn‚Äôt sure what to do about it.

Even though he told me he doesn‚Äôt want to talk right now and has blocked me, I still have the urge to see him. I even thought about bringing him flowers. I feel happy that he‚Äôs moving forward, but at the same time, I feel sad, angry, and confused. I don‚Äôt understand how I can feel both at once.

‚∏ª

Update

I ended up going to see him, but it went really badly. He treated me poorly and humiliated me ,  even calling his new girlfriend while I was there.

Later, at the train station where we agreed to talk, I found out that he had cheated on me while we were still in on-and-off contact. What hurt me most wasn‚Äôt just the cheating, but that he lied about it , especially after I had told him how deeply I‚Äôm affected by dishonesty because of my past experiences with cheating in my family, relationships, and friendships.

He kept denying that the new girl was his girlfriend, even though he was sending her his daily pictures. He said he still can‚Äôt move on from me but also told me to stay away.

I told him I didn‚Äôt care who he sleeps with , that I‚Äôm hurt because of his lies, not his actions. He asked, ‚ÄúDo you really not care?‚Äù and I said, ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

Then he started saying really cruel things , he brought up my family and said hurtful comments like, ‚ÄúYou mean your dad cheated on your mom?‚Äù and compared his parents to mine. I told him not to bring my family into it, but he continued. He even told me he hates me, wishes I‚Äôd die, and bragged that his new girl is a virgin. The I told him , okay enjoy your virgin. 

I don‚Äôt understand why he said these things. He yelled at me, then ran away. We were both crying.

Afterward, I called his parents and told them to please ask him not to contact me anymore, because if he does, I know I‚Äôll be tempted to take him back , and I don‚Äôt want that. I feel embarrassed about how everything happened, and I‚Äôm still hurting deeply.

1o51ekl,What to do next after a breakup,"Its now been 2 weeks since I 23m broke up with my ex girlfriend 24f.  She was my first love and someone I saw as a life partner.  Sadly sometimes things are not meant to be.  Neither of us were perfect, but in the last 2 months of our relationship communication became one sided and she didn't want to let me into her mind.  I know breaking up with her was probably the best decision.  There was to many differences and who know maybe we both just had different views on what a relationship was.  Since then I have felt so many emotions and have gone through so much.  I've cried, thought about going back to her, trying to reach out even though we both blocked eachother.  I know how crazy those thoughts are but still I have thought them.  My mind isn't in the healthiest place but I dont want to stay like this.  For me and for all the great memories I have of us in the past i dont want to keep sitting here feeling like I cant move, but I dont know what to do.  I have found plenty of outlets that help momentarily or help me forget but the lump in my throat when I think about her or see something she likes is still there.

1o518me,Break up because of unresolved trauma,"Hi all, I've never made a post before but I really need to hear other people's experiences/opinions because it's one that other people haven't been able to advise me on. 

My girlfriend of 2 years broke up with me. It wasn't sudden, I had already begun grieving the relationship during our last few weeks before the inevitable happened. 

Out of the blue, she became extremely distant and flooded her life with new friends, even entertaining ones that clearly wanted her. I knew something was wrong and when I saw her, she completely tore me down and my character, making me believe I was the problem. A few days later, she explained her past trauma which she hadn't resolved and had the sudden urge to be alone, wanted a clean slate because dating made her feel 'dirty'. I know none of this is about me, at all.

I eventually ended things because I saw she was entertaining other men with flirty conversation ‚Äì It was clearly completely inappropriate, and after doing some research and reflecting, I have come to understand she sabotaged the relationship to push me away and release the pressure of the relationship. (she's a fearful avoidant) After all this, she made it very clear that I am a substantial loss to her. I know she loves me as she has credited me for putting the soul back into her body and I am the reason she is excited to live again.

When we said our final goodbyes, she made it out as if we're doing this together for our own growth and that she finally feels 'clean'. She said maybe if we find each other in the future it can work out, if we are meant to be. 

I really don't understand if I need to be there to support her through her healing or if I need to just leave and never look back (easier said than done). We have gone through a lot together and our relationship has been quite literally perfect. In the end, she was absolutely clinging on to our friendship because we tried to make it work but she feared leading me on. 

Any sort of advice would go a long way for me. ",sudocreamleader,1760304283.0,3,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o518me/break_up_because_of_unresolved_trauma/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o518me/break_up_because_of_unresolved_trauma/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o50ypv,Ex spoke to me at shops,"To give a brief background,  my ex, let's call him Tom (25M) and I (24M) dated for 4 years and I broke up with him after finding out he was cheating emotionally (sending nudes etc). I was really in love with him. I said I needed space to think about it. A month later and I just couldn't see myself taking back someone who cheated so I ended things. A few weeks go by and he texts saying I have some things still at his. He came over and we ended up having sex. I asked him if he was seeing anyone and he said no. I wasn't either. At this point I still loved him and it didn't really sink in he had cheated. Each 3 weeks go by 3 times, and he comes over. The second time he started crying alot. About 2 weeks after we last saw eachother, I was at an event in a different city and sat next to a girl who was talking about how her sister is dating an amazing guy. It was him. I knew it was him based on the niche things she was saying. The next day I saw them together in my town he lives in with her. They worked out right infront of me at the gym. At this point I thought he had cheated on her. I reached out to her to say we had only seen eachother 2 weeks prior. All in all, she basically said she knew and she hoped the 3 of us can get along. I texted him and said he was a horrible person out of anger. To me it felt like he had cheated all over again. I asked hum if he was seeing anyone and he lied again.

For the next year after the break up, I would see him and her now and then. I would see him with his girlfriend at the gym and he would stare at me until i looked away. I had a break from dating but then met someone (Sam) and was with them for 6 months. He was amazing but we weren't in love. 

The next week after this break up, I would see Tom every single time he went to the supermarket.  He would basically run in the opposite direction and I would ignore. I kept seeing him for a month. The other day I saw a car behind me that looked like his. It was him. He waved and smiled at me. I kind of gave him an awkward smile. I walked around and we ended up head on just staring at eachother. He asked me how I was. I said good, I've seen you around a lot lately. 

A bit of a background,  When we ended things and kept seeing eachother, he was unemployed.  He was fired from his last job and was in the process of becoming a firefighter. I kept asking him about it even after the break up and he said he would let me know if he gets in or not but he was with someone new so i didn't expect him to text and he never did.

After I said I was good, he said he didn't make it as a firefighter but he is in the police. I said the police? He said yes, he's a policeman. He asked if I still live where I am, (which is a road down from him). I said yes but I'm looking at leaving. He said where, and I said a few suburbs around. He asked if I was at the same job and I said yes but I'm thinking of joining the navy. He said the navy? Then said Goodluck and ""I'll see you around."" 

I left and I saw him in the corner of my eye checking out beside me. When we were together I didn't have a car, he was with me when I passed my driving test. I had only recently bought a car that I'm pretty proud of. As I left the car park, I saw him in his car and honked 3 times. I saw him drive behind me. 4 days prior to this I saw him. He was behind me in the car but I don't think he knew it was me. He took an immediate right to his house which makes sense. For me, I continue straight. Anyways after I honked, he followed and continued straight, taking the longer route and driving past my house.

I guess I just want help understanding why he decided to talk to me now. I have a feeling he wanted to me to tell him I was proud of him. The past year has been up and down. I've been in therapy because of how he treated me. I feel like he has forgotten about what he did or doesn't realize the damage.  Apart of me also wants to tell him I'm proud of him. I just feel confused and sad.

1o50qvn,1st time Breakup,"I‚Äôve recently broken up with my 21m boyfriend of 2 years, but being close for 3. He called me this week saying that he needs space having now moved to another part of the country which is a significant distance away from myself. I confess I don‚Äôt remember the exact reasons he said, but what I understood was that it was along the lines of recently gaining more independence than he had before he moved and he needs to be single to explore that. Said independence that I strongly encouraged and supported - so in some ways one could say this is a problem of my own making but in actual fact I‚Äôm proud of him in taking this jump and being independent.

This did come as a shock to me in the moment but I had felt this coming for a little while. I had my own doubts on our relationship for the last few months. Not anything awful, just doubts. The nagging feeling of ‚ÄúCan I see this go long term?‚Äù or ‚ÄúAre we really compatible?‚Äù after some of our arguments or even my actual attraction towards him. I enjoyed the physicality of having a partner, someone to have close and cuddle but I had doubts on whether that I liked the physicality I had especially with him or I liked just having someone close. Hence the relationship becoming long distance, deep down I knew that I would struggle. I still loved him, and deeply cared about him but I couldn‚Äôt really shake those doubts. 

This breakup has now left me conflicted. 

On the one hand I am deeply upset, I‚Äôve been crying for the last few day in some ways uncontrollably. He is really truly my first love - and in a cringy way taught me how to love. I feel lost, in that I don‚Äôt have my person anymore, my confidant, my best friend to message at any hour, minute or even second of the day.

Yet on the other hand I feel slight relief. The doubts that I had are no longer there, they are in effect ‚Äúsolved‚Äù. I honestly think if he hadn‚Äôt done it I would probably be breaking up with him in a months time or so. 

I think back on our time together with elation, whether that was when we went on holiday or our time at university. The only anger I really feel towards him is that he made me love him. He‚Äôs an absolute prick for rocking my world so much that I truly loved him that my heart bleeds as much as it does now. 

I feel sad that I can‚Äôt comfort him in one way or another. I know this breakup wasn‚Äôt one that was easy for him, he also deeply loved me. However I completely understand on his own thought process on why he broke up with me. I‚Äôm not angry with it by any stretch. 

We talked about things hypothetically if we broke up when were together on what we wanted. He expressed to me that he would still want me in his life, and I concur with that as well. He has been instrumental in my growth as a person and I think I have been to him. It‚Äôs still early days and whether that will happen I don‚Äôt know. In a way I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm holding onto that idea too much not allowing me to heal properly.

Currently I‚Äôve gone no-contact with him as I think he and I need space to process everything, even if it is so painful to do so. When we do start talking to each other I‚Äôm not sure. What that looks like or how it will work I‚Äôm not sure either.

I know not many people are friends with their ex‚Äôs due to varying reasons, but one of the main things is that‚Äôs it‚Äôs too painful to be friends with someone you still love. Something that prowls on my mind. How does my love change from Romantic to Platonic? Yet was the wind already blowing in that direction? Is that why I was having doubts?

Could our relationship been saved if we stayed close together, perhaps. But perhaps we were always destined to breakup as we travelled down different paths. 

I still do love him now though what exactly that love is I can‚Äôt describe, I will always love our time together, I‚Äôm upset that it didn‚Äôt last longer. I hope that we can be friends in future whenever that may be, or at least try hoping the odds are in our favour.

Can anyone relate to this?

1o50otb,How fucked am I?,"This person and I were dating from Jan 2025 to May 6th 2025. The reasons where simple: she was afraid of hurting me but felt like she was loosing feelings. Her days were getting harder and she saw me trying too hard to help her out, but in the end she felt like she was hurting me.
Me? Well, I should've communicated or tried but with this person. Harsher topics were hard to communicate - they would physically shutdown with stress and then would have an emotional breakdown.
We broke up. Went a month on contact. Then we both, on the same day, decided that we've had enough. We talked for 6 Horus about how hard the breakup was, and how weird it all felt.
She told me she couldn't confirm if she wanted to go back, but she would think about it during summer. I did ask if she still has a crush - she did.
The whole summer we did talk a bunch of times. Sometimes she'd go away, sometimes not. There were invitations made. The letters keto being written. The playlist kept going - all things she asked to keep ( and whilst I was on the ""idk phase"", it didn't feel wrong).
She did tell me her greatest fear was leading me on. That being said she did, in the same conversation, admit that maybe our breakup was a bit ""too dramatic"" from both.
She comes back. She brings 2 books for a project I'm doing - project that she actually didn't really like that I was doing, but decided to support me anyway.
She still talked to me but there was something in the air. Some stillness in her behavior. So we did go take a coffee. 
After a long conversation where she seemed very defensive, even looking back at things she adored from the relationship -like our little nicknames - with spite, shutting down any argument we had in our conversation about politics and friendships stuff...she was just too damned defensive about everything. I felt like the person I loved just...changed. 
Idk what to make of her now. 
The end of that conversation ended with her telling em that actually, that movie we both decided we'd like to watch together, won't be enjoyable to me. After asking if she felt nothing for me, she affirmed that yes, she doesn't feel anything for me. That she hated my first analysis of the situation before the summer was something she hated. That it was all her fault, said she was sorry but ""love is the base of all relationships. Love that isn't there"".
It was a hard pill to swallow after such a summer I've had. Just told her how special she was to me and what I learned and where I fucked up - things that I have said in the past. She told me that she would go back, if there was love. But there's no love here anymore.

I want to take her at face value. But this is so alien to me. This person wasn't like this.
She asked to keep writing letters in this last Convo. I said no. The playlist is still alive. after we broke up for the second time, she's been sending me either things she specifically knows I'd like or reels - the first one was on the day we broke up for the second time.
She wanted a respectable friendship - but where the fuck is respect here is beyond me. I did communicate I was going to need some time. 
(To her, a couple of hours).
She's inevitable in my life. We have classes in the same classroom in Uni. 
She's looked at me sometimes - every single time she either smiles very warmly (which she doesn't do to most) or looks worried.

I really want to take what she said at face value. But I feel like there's nothing I can do. I feel like I deserve a real honest talk about what happened but I don't think I'll ever get that. I wish I could move on but I love this person. She was my first relationship in my life. My first everything. And it's becoming very hard to let go.

What the fuck shoud I do?

I thought maybe just keeping an open stance, overlook the situation, focus on my little life that's full of issues and problems and wait - either until someone new pops into my eyes, or she breaks down these defenses and talks to me about whatever.

My responses to her have been nothing but distant but warm. Yet she went one week cold silent and I freaked out. So this is not something that has been very nice to me.
I hate being where I'm at. I love her a lot and I do believe if we just talked about shit and not jump the gun, maybe we'd still be together ( I know these thoughts won't help, but I want to be as sincere as possible).

By keeping this distance and living my life, um hoping she'll understand that this friendship ""isn't a fucking friendship"". That it's not okay that she keeps sending me reels with symbols from our relationship. That it's not okay that she's still actively liking insta stories of mine like nothing ever happened. 

But I dont want to hurt her. Nor want to fully let go. It's confusing.

1o50nzg,just found out my ex is dating the guy she told me not to worry about,"We were together for four years. We started young, and I‚Äôll admit the first half of our relationship had its toxic moments. But as we matured, we found our faith, shared the same beliefs, and really worked on ourselves and our relationship.

Fast forward to this year ‚Äî she‚Äôs already discarded me twice. She came back once, and I was foolish enough to take her back because I still believed in us. But then she left again, this time for no clear reason, completely blindsiding me. Weeks later, she began blaming me for things we had already talked through and forgiven each other for years ago, which left me confused and deeply hurt.

It‚Äôs been two months since the breakup. Since then, she‚Äôs been going out and partying a lot while I‚Äôm still carrying the emotional weight of our four years together. Recently, I found out through her Instagram posts that she‚Äôs already seeing someone ‚Äî the same guy I once asked her to block because he‚Äôs known for being manipulative and arrogant, even having hurt others in the past. I also heard disturbing things about him, and it worries me because I don‚Äôt think she knows what kind of person he truly is.

I‚Äôve never felt this low before. I can‚Äôt help but wonder ‚Äî was she already seeing him before we broke up? Is this how avoidant people usually act? I‚Äôm just so confused. It‚Äôs made me question my self-worth and whether what we had ever truly meant anything to her.

1o50n5u,Thinking about my ex ALL the time,"First post on here and it's a pretty heavy one. It's been just under 7 weeks since breaking up so it's still very recent in the grand scheme of things but she is literally all I can think about, all day every day. I keep myself busy with work and going to the gym, although those things are feeling empty at the moment. I eat healthy and see family regularly. The different memories and thoughts of her and us going through my head are relentless, even when I'm 'busy'. The closest I actually came to messaging was about 3 weeks after the break up where I'd been out with friends at a live sporting event which was really fun and when I got home the high of that had worn off leaving me feeling incredibly vulnerable to reaching out. For context we broke up because we'd been doing long distance (England and Canada) for a year and it'd reached a point of it being unsustainable without someone moving which wasn't a viable plan for at least a couple more years. It was left on really good terms which makes it harder to use any negative character traits to help with processing. Like everyone she had her flaws but it feels wrong to focus on those when for the most part the relationship was happy and healthy. I know that I just need time (and lots of it) but it's so painful right now, and I'm so aware of how many of my thoughts are consumed by her which makes the cycle worse.

1o50lnc,How to feel better?,"I (17f) was dating my boyfriend (17m) for 3 1/2 years. We met when we were 12 in 7th grade and started dating in 8th grade. We both just started senior year of highschool and we have officially broke it off. It was completely mutual and we agreed we both needed it because we weren't being fair to each other. We fought a lot, we had conflicting communication tactics, and there was overall lack of coordination between us and compatibility. The final straw was when for the first time in our whole relationship, I started making friends that were guys and we wanted to hang out. He got angry saying that he didn't get why I was pursuing other men, even after I explained I just wanted to be friends. He stayed mad at me and didn't budge, but I held my ground and said he wasn't going to control who I get to hang out with. Wednesday, we got in a fight over whatever and as I was putting on my shoes to leave, he stood up really quickly and it really scared me. I jumped back and started crying just because he was already yelling, I was yelling, and emotions were high. He got mad at me for thinking he was going to hurt me and he kicked me out. He slammed the door, and on my way back to school, he called me saying ""I am not with you right now. Why would you think I would do that?!"" And he just seemed very angry. I was apologizing and crying and he ultimately told me that he really didnt want to be with me because I would ""ruin his reputation"". Ever since then, we have been broken up and we are both definitely crushed. We talked it over more and said we clearly don't work together and it's time to end it. But it's so much of my life I feel like is being taken away from me. I've texted him multiple times and called him crying multiple times. We have both cried together and we have said our last goodbyes, ""I love you""s, and kisses. I just feel so depressed. I've redone a lot of stuff to my room to feel newer, but I feel like I need some more to make myself feel better. It all so complicated and I feel all over the place.

1o50flz,Difficult Situation,"Hi everyone,
I'm here to share my experience after my recent breakup and to get some perspective. About four weeks ago, my girlfriend decided to break up. It was her first relationship, her first everything basicly, so I think that the decision was extra hard. The breakup was tough on her, and it was equally difficult for me.

In the aftermath, we've had limited contact. She came by to collect some of her belongings last week , and we both felt the weight of the situation. She expressed that she still had feelings for me and that it was a painful decision for her, too. However, we agreed not to have any contact throughout October, and then perhaps reconnect in November to talk things through.

I dont know what will happen when we reconnect, but it should boil down to two main options. She will realise that she is better off without me and then it will probably the last time we see us. I will accept her dicision and will try to move on. Focusing on my future.
She also could still have feelings and be willing to try again. My emotions would want me to be with her and try everything, but my logic tells me that a broken up relationship cant be reconstructed and that there is reason that it happened in the first place.

I'm torn about what the future holds.  On one hand, I still love her deeply and wonder if we could find a way back to each other. On the other hand, I'm concerned about the challenges ahead, especially since she‚Äôs doing an exchange semester abroad next semester. That means a long-distance relationship would be challenging, and I worry about the emotional toll it might take on both of us.

1o50c4l,Should I be the one to reach out after a month of silence or accept that it‚Äôs over?,"I have been seeing a woman same age(we both thirties), on and off for about a year. It started casual, mostly sleepovers and time together every couple of weeks. But our connection was somehow also deep.. in the beginning, neither of us wanted a relationship. So I withdraw sleeping together... so it was basically turned into casual, sex meetings... but it kept on.
But 3 months ago, she told me she wanted something more serious, at least sleep together, spend nights, or go somewhere as a trip...and try...and I admitted that I was scared of getting attached because I was still untangling things with my ex. And still on dating apps...

Despite that, we stayed connected...
she‚Äôd bring me gifts from her trips, we shared music, talked deeply. But every time things got emotionally closer, I‚Äôd pull back a bit, and she‚Äôd pull s back, too.

Last time we saw each other (about a month ago) everything felt warm and natural, but after that she went quiet. A few days later she sent a short message thanking me for a music band I‚Äôd shown her, and that was it. I replied, she liked the message, and since then: nothing.

Part of me feels like she‚Äôs protecting herself and waiting for me to make a real move, since I‚Äôve been the one who hesitated in the past. Another part of me feels frustrated: like she could have also checked in, even just to say hi.

So here‚Äôs my question: If I actually want to make this work, is it on me to reach out first? Or should I respect the silence and let her go?

Everyone saw how madly in love we both were. He was the best boyfriend in the beginning and I always told him how lucky I was to be with him. His parents told me how good I was for him and they have never seen him this happy. He said it was the first time he ever truly experienced love. A few months before the breakup he was cold and distant. I would ask him all the time if something was wrong and he always said I was imagining things. The things he would do without asking, he stopped doing. He started putting in zero effort and he said it was because he was comfortable. It crushed me. It felt like he hated me. I would go to bed crying myself to sleep because he rather spend time on his video games than with me. The times he did spend with me he acted like he was doing me a favor. After constant fighting and me being the only one trying to repair everything. I broke up with him. It‚Äôs been a while now and I am so much happier. I don‚Äôt go to sleep in tears anymore.

Im really struggling. It came out of the blue after what I thought was a strong few years with few hiccups here and there but then seemed to have coasted.

1o4yye6,How to get over ex?,"Hi all,

Some things changed for confidentiality. So I dated my ex for four years, and one day of the blue they broke up with me. We had been doing long distance, which was tough, but doable, and the end was in sight. The long distance was my fault for having to go off to school for two years. after he broke up with me, he kept in touch and called every day until I moved home six months later. I was still desperate to have him back, and he is the only man I‚Äôve ever loved (I‚Äôm 32 now). 

When I moved home we started seeing eachother twice a week for dates, and I did keep telling him I wanted a relationship but he would be cagey about it. At dinner once he said that the worst day of his life would be the day I married someone else. And a month later he cried in my arms about how he had hurt me. 

In parallel, my job when I moved back was terrible, and I got an opportunity to move again far away for an awesome job. I took it and it again will be a temporary thing where I will be gone for three years. And then I‚Äôm moving back home permanently.

I told him I was leaving again and he looked crushed, but how am I supposed to plan around a man who can‚Äôt make a decision? I was begging him to stay. 

Two weeks before I am leaving (which I felt terrible because I hated leaving and moving so incredibly much) he asked me for a walk and said he had started dating someone else. He had been messaging me still every day and using my pet names.
 
I was crushed but I picked myself up and moved countries. He called every three days or so and used my pet names and was charming. Three months into the new place I asked him to stop contacting me because if he wasn‚Äôt going to date me then it was actual torture. He said at that call that it was a good thing he didn‚Äôt try to date me because I would‚Äôve just left again and he couldn‚Äôt have survived that.

Cut to a couple months after that, he sent the most beautiful note for my birthday last year and he sent text messages throughout the year, although he grew more distant obviously because he had a full blown relationship with someone else. But he was still messaging probably once a month using my pet names.

We had a mutual work thing in April (a year out from me moving) and we met for dinner with a colleague and he looked like he saw a ghost. I was acting normal and I just would catch him looking at me and it was the oddest thing. He broke my heart over and over and I don‚Äôt understand why he was looking at me so odd. I wanted to address it, so I asked for a coffee during the week, but he really was so avoidant. I‚Äôve never had an ex seem to need to flea a room, and I wasn‚Äôt angry but I was just so confused and hurt. He used me as like an emotional comfort blanket so that he could fall in love with the new girlfriend.

I texted him for his birthday and I was the first person he messaged back on his birthday and he was super sweet about it. And then a month later I heard from a mutual friend that he is moving in and marrying the new girlfriend. And after that I sent a message that I heard, was happy for him, but asked him to please never contact me again. We spent like 24/7 together before I moved and all our time talking when I moved and he was my best friend for like 5 years.

Basically I‚Äôm wanting to know of any examples where people got over stuff like this. I really haven‚Äôt found love again and have dated a ton, and I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs going to happen for me. And I still feel so hurt and used. And I think maybe there is something wrong with me psychologically for not being an able to let him go.

1o4yw62,"Is this considered ""breadcrumbing""?","I broke up with my ex-girlfriend 3 months ago now. I noticed she wasn't happy with me or the relationship yet did not leave. I had a feeling she didn't want to be the one to end it, so to allow her to find the happiness and peace she wanted, I told her I wanted to break up.

We'd spoken a couple of times, each time leaving me more hurt as she gave more honest answers about our relationship. Example: she didn't desire me sexually that much, she couldn't be the best version of herself because I was too attentive and didn't give her space/a chance to miss me. 

Anyway, she has mentioned each time that she wanted to remain friends and even pushed me to get over the relationship after a month so she 'can have her friend back'. I told her I couldn't for now, as I am not going to be half involved in someone's life. Eventually, she will be with a new man and I can't take that right now. So I told her, I will heal at my own pace and will reach out when ready, and if she no longer wants to be friends by then, that is fine too. 

Last week, she sent me a message. I was surprised as I didn't ever think for a moment she would do so. I thought I would be replaced pretty quick and could fade away in silence while she was with a new guy. The message was short. ""Hi, was thinking of you. Hope you and the family are well."" I kept my response brief. ""I'm okay. Work and gym. Hope you are too."" I wasn't interested in engaging in conversation, so thought that message would end it. She sent one more, ""A friendly message wishing you a lovely time celebrating your Mum's birthday next month."" 

My Mum's birthday had already passed, and I don't recall telling her when it was either. Again, kept it simple. ""It was last month, but appreciate the sentiment. Anyway, continue to stay well."" I didn't expect another response but a final one came. ""I'm here if you want to reach out again but want to respect your boundary. You do cross my mind and I wonder how you are keeping,""

I didn't respond to that. I felt like I was doing pretty well with my healing with therapy and gym etc...but that message set me back. I was happy to know she still thinks of me, but something bugs me about it. She's emphasised ""friends"" many times. This is the first breakup where...well an actual breakup happened. My last partner simply vanished and blocked me on everything! So, I'm not used to this. Is this a ""breadcrumb""? Am I overthinking this all? Would love to hear your thoughts.

1o4yby4,Been About 2 Years Now,"It has been about 2 years now since my last relationship ended. I don't remember what the exact date was, nor do I want to. Be I know it's sometime soon. At most a week from now. Probably less.

And, I have to say, I haven't recovered.

I don't feel as bad as I did at the start anymore but how I felt at the start was very, very bad. Maybe the worst I've ever felt. And that's saying something. Plus, I'm on a boatload of antidepressants at this point, so that probably has something to do with it being less bad.

I think the biggest reason why I still haven't recovered is what it has been from the start.

For the vast majority of our relationship things seemed incredible. I basically felt like I had found my dream girl. I'd had other girlfriends before, but never before did someone seem so perfect for me. And she seemed to love me deeply. And the one day things just changed. It's like from one day to the next with no warning, she disconnected. And two weeks later, it was over. And it was like she didn't even care.

I barely ever cry. I think I've cried, idk, 10 times over the last 10 years? I have a hard time with it. But I cried when things ended. She didn't. It felt like it was nothing to her. Like one day she went from telling me I was the best boyfriend ever (she literally told me this about 2 weeks before things ended) to just basically saying I meant nothing to her anymore.

It was... complete whiplash. It's like in two weeks she became a different person.

And I think that's why I can't seem to process this. Because I have two versions of her in my head. One which was the version of her that I knew for 99% of our relationship. And one which I knew at the end. And they feel like different people. And I feel differently about them. And I can't unite them in my mind. I still love that one person, and the other person I just feel... wasn't a very good person.

Truth be told though... there were red flags that I ignored. Because they seemed so minor compared to everything else at the time. Like for example during our first date I remember that she said some rather denigrating things about someone else, which made me a bit uncomfortable. But it was one thing among so many positive things about our first date. But there were many small things like that which, in retrospect, feel like they add up to something. And I did notice them at the time they happened. But I minimized them. Because she seemed so fantastic in so many ways.

I mean, I hadn't felt this way about a person since my first girlfriend when I was 17. You know, the way your heart flutters when you get to see them again when you're first dating? I've had other girlfriends, but for quite a while I thought that was just a thing reserved for teenagers that I was never going to experience again as an adult. But then I started dating her and I felt it again. The first time I kissed her I literally wanted to jump from joy afterwards.

I still miss her or... do I? I don't even know which version of her was real or who she really was anymore. It feels like nothing makes sense and I just doubt myself so much. Replaying that final month over and over again in my mind. That's when I feel the worst...

And despite the her at the end, who I don't like, there's also the her who was my girlfriend... and she still seems great.

In my previous relationships there was always a decline. A lot of fights or disagreements, a lot of friction, or clearly diverging priorities or something. The relationship decays. With my first girlfriend it decayed over about 2 months or so where we constantly argued. With my third girlfriend it declined over more than a year where a toxic pattern had developed. Toxic enough that my psychologist told me afterwards that she was glad when that relationship ended, because I deserved better, basically. But with my previous girlfriend it just seemed to happen one day. Like I had skipped months into the future or something.

Right before things ended I was actually planning our anniversary date, because it was about to be our anniversary (our first date was in October too). That's what made me write this thread. I was walking passed somewhere that I walked passed heading for that first date, basically.

Really though, I don't think I'll ever truly recover from this one. I think a part of me has just been broken. Chipped off. And I can never be whole again. That there will always be a piece of me that I left behind there.

Anyway, I've rambled enough. Just needed to write this down somewhere.",OneOnOne6211,1760297486.0,4,0.84,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o4yby4/been_about_2_years_now/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o4yby4/been_about_2_years_now/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o4ybs3,The Highway,"Hello friends,

I‚Äôm now about two months post-discard, maintaining strict no contact, and I can confidently say I‚Äôm feeling significantly better. That heavy, suffocating weight on my chest - the withdrawal - is finally lifting. I still ruminate daily, but as I shared in a previous post, my logical mind is starting to win more battles than it loses. Every day, reason is gaining ground over emotion, and that, to me, is progress.

I wanted to share a metaphor my therapist gave me recently, one that genuinely¬†*clicked*¬†for me. I hope it might do the same for some of you.



**Imagine this:**

You‚Äôre driving your car down the highway. You‚Äôve been driving for years, you‚Äôre experienced, responsible, staying in your lane, within the speed limit, doing everything right. Out of nowhere, a drunk driver slams into you. A brutal crash. Your car rolls over, spins, crashes to the side of the road - it‚Äôs completely totaled. Somehow, miraculously, you survive. You‚Äôre bruised, shaken, disoriented - but alive.

In the aftermath, your friends and family are supportive. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lucky to be alive,‚Äù they say. ‚ÄúYou dodged a bullet.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll get a new car ‚Äî it could‚Äôve been much worse!‚Äù And you know they‚Äôre right. But something in you has changed. Because the crash - that‚Äôs when the trauma actually began.

The next time you even think about getting behind the wheel, something in your chest tightens.¬†*Can I really do this again?*¬†*Am I safe? Can I trust myself? I‚Äôm scared.*¬†*Maybe it‚Äôs easier to just let someone else drive.*¬†You don‚Äôt feel ready, and it feels like you never will again.¬†

¬†

**The beauty of this metaphor lies in how many layers it holds.**

You can be an amazing driver, just like you can be a great partner - and still end up in a devastating wreck. Why? Because no matter how well you drive, you can‚Äôt control who else is on the road, or what they choose to do. You can do everything right and still get blindsided. What you¬†*can*¬†control is how you respond, what you learn from the crash, and how you choose to move forward.

And just like it‚Äôs not your job to educate a full-grown adult on why they shouldn‚Äôt drink and drive, it‚Äôs also not your responsibility to psychoanalyse a partner‚Äôs harmful patterns, rationalise their chaos, or get lost in the futile task of trying to ""*fix*"" them.

This experience is not personal - it‚Äôs not a criticism of your driving skills or ability to love or your worth as a partner. There‚Äôs no point in overanalysing and replaying the past and pondering if the outcome would‚Äôve been different if you drove a bit slower or said that one extra sentence that one night 5 months ago when you got in a fight. The truth is the way someone treats you says far more about¬†*them*¬†than it ever did about¬†*you*. It‚Äôs *not* personal.¬†

At some point, slowly and painfully, you begin to accept the crash for what it was. You stop fighting the reality. You begin to see that no amount of perfect driving would have prevented someone else‚Äôs reckless choices. It was never about¬†*your*¬†driving skills. You didn‚Äôt cause the crash - you just happened to be in the wrong lane at the wrong time with the wrong person.¬†

You come to the realisation, that whatever you would have or could have done - the result was inevitable. And this realisation is¬†*liberating*. Only then do you truly understand what people meant when they said, ‚Äú*You dodged a bullet*.‚Äù This though, does *not* absolve you of your responsibility of continuing to drive carefully or finding a more suitable partner in the future.

¬†

**But here‚Äôs the important part:**

Healing doesn‚Äôt mean abandoning the road. It means eventually getting back behind the wheel, this time with more awareness, more caution, more self-trust.

One day, when you‚Äôre ready, you¬†*will*¬†drive again - you¬†*will*¬†love again. Not because someone else convinces you to, but because it‚Äôs who you are. It‚Äôs¬†*within*¬†you. You‚Äôll remember you were always a good driver. You realise you loved deeply, gave wholeheartedly - and that came from¬†*you*. It was never dependent on the other person. It was your¬†*capacity to love*¬†that made it real.

And when you‚Äôre back on that highway, you‚Äôll start to notice things you missed before. You‚Äôll recognise the warning signs, the ‚Äòred flags‚Äô if you will. The drivers who can‚Äôt stay in their lane, the ones swerving unpredictably, the ones speeding. You‚Äôll trust your gut. You‚Äôll adjust your boundaries. And when someone dangerous gets too close, you‚Äôll¬†*change lanes*.

And one day as you‚Äôre driving along with your favourite tune playing in the background it suddenly hits you -¬†*I‚Äôve learned the lesson*. Somehow, despite it all, you‚Äôve become not just a better driver... but a stronger, wiser version of yourself. You realise your worth and the treatment you‚Äôll accept from people going forward. You‚Äôll seek the characteristics in others you yourself exhibit.¬†

¬†

Stay the course. Keep healing. You‚Äôve already survived the crash. The road ahead is still yours to drive. And remember, you can always change lane.¬†",Feisty_Ad9759,1760297474.0,4,0.84,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o4ybs3/the_highway/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o4ybs3/the_highway/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o4yark,Ex thinks I‚Äôm obsessed with her,"5 months ago, my ex girlfriend broke up with me. I understand why, I myself was going to break up with her, but I felt extremely sad after. I neglected her for the last 8 months of our relationship, and I felt as though I was ‚Äòtoo cool‚Äô for her or something, but when the breakup actually happened, all the memories and regret came flooding in. We spoke for 3 months after the breakup as she was my only emotional support system, and I felt as though I couldn‚Äôt talk to anyone else. I‚Äôm not proud of it, but I begged her, and despite her saying that she wanted to be friends, I never put myself in the right headspace to just be friends and ‚Äòsee where we go‚Äô because of how emotionally distraught I was. In the last 2 weeks of those 3 months, she said she would never date me at that point because ‚Äòit‚Äôs only been weeks‚Äô, and so immaturely I got angry at her telling her I‚Äôve been trying my hardest for her and whatnot. We didn‚Äôt entirely stop talking after that, because I guess I had ‚Äòwithdrawals‚Äô. 

5 days before she went to a party, she said that she didn‚Äôt want anything with any other guys because she‚Äôs still recovering. Then, when she went to a party and we talked after, she talked with so much attitude towards me and I didn‚Äôt know why. I then found out through friends that she got with a guy during this party, and I didn‚Äôt know if it was true and I felt as if I needed to know for my sanity, so I asked her, and she said yes and that hooking up doesn‚Äôt fall under the category of nothing with guys. She completely berated me, and told me to fuck off an get the fuck out of her life.

After that, I was really struggling mentally, but I kept on reading books by therapists and learnt to understand my emotions, but most importantly, why I treated her in the manner that I treated her during the end of the relationship, and I really reflected on it. 

Anyways, I found out she‚Äôs hosting a party next weekend, and I wasn‚Äôt invited because ‚ÄòI‚Äôm obsessed with her‚Äô. I simply cannot comprehend how she thinks like that - I haven‚Äôt had any interaction with her in 6 weeks, despite me having to see her everyday (college) and still not doing anything. I really wanted to talk to her in our upcoming time off from college to just speak as mature adults and show her that I have changed and can be friends with her as I miss her as a friend so much, but I don‚Äôt think I should anymore. I think maybe the narrative comes from her coping mechanism, and especially her friends who keep on telling her that she‚Äôs the shit and I can just see them saying that I‚Äôm clingy and obsessed and haven‚Äôt changed, as they‚Äôre the type of people to not help her process her emotions but to help her ‚Äòexercise her freedom‚Äô.

She was so special to me because of how kind and down to earth she was, but now I feel like I don‚Äôt know if she‚Äôll ever actually listen to me, and I still miss her and want to talk and treat her the way she deserves.

1o4y57v,"I ruined the best relationship I ever had, and I can‚Äôt forgive myself","I (21M) can‚Äôt stop replaying my breakup from two years ago. It feels like everything good I had, I destroyed with my own hands.

When I was 19 and just starting university, I joined a big friend group ‚Äî the kind that everyone wanted to be part of. That‚Äôs where I met a girl I‚Äôll call Jamie. She was shy at first but once you talked to her, she was kind, mature, and incredibly easy to connect with. We bonded over cars, started talking online, and soon our group began teasing us for flirting. What started out as something playful quickly turned into something real.

We became inseparable. I thought she was ‚Äúthe one.‚Äù Everything felt right ‚Äî until jealousy slowly started eating away at us. She had guy friends and sometimes talked to them in a way that made me uncomfortable. She didn‚Äôt mean anything by it, but I started feeling like I wasn‚Äôt special anymore. I asked her to set boundaries, and after a while, she did. But that was the start of constant fights over who we could or couldn‚Äôt talk to.

She never asked me to stop talking to my female friends, but she‚Äôd make small remarks that made me feel guilty, so I ended up cutting people off. Meanwhile, I expected her to do the same with her guy friends. Most of our arguments came from that imbalance.

We slowly pulled away from our friend group because people started joking about her behind her back, which hurt her deeply. I stood by her, but our relationship had already become tense. She was the silent type during fights, and I was the kind who needed to talk things out immediately. That mismatch made everything worse.

Then I made the biggest mistake of my life. Out of my own insecurity and confusion, I started seeking attention online. I crossed lines that broke her trust completely. I don‚Äôt want to go into details, but what I did was unforgivable. She found out, and it broke her. She stopped talking to me.

I thought time and space would help me grow, but I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about her. I tried to move on, focused on studies, even won some awards ‚Äî but she was still there in my mind. Then I found out she was seeing someone else. I confronted her out of anger, and she told me she liked him because he treated her the way she wanted me to. That hit me like a truck.

We spoke again a few times after that, and for a moment, it felt like maybe we could start over. But when she learned the full extent of what I‚Äôd done, she cut me off completely ‚Äî told me never to contact her again.

Now she‚Äôs moved on with her life, and I‚Äôm still stuck here, full of regret. People at uni know parts of the story, and I‚Äôve become the guy everyone whispers about. I know I earned that reputation, but it still hurts.

I‚Äôm not looking for pity. I just want to understand how to live with myself after hurting someone I truly loved. How do you forgive yourself when the guilt never leaves? How do you stop missing someone you know you don‚Äôt deserve anymore?",FloorSelect1502,1760297051.0,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o4y57v/i_ruined_the_best_relationship_i_ever_had_and_i/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o4y57v/i_ruined_the_best_relationship_i_ever_had_and_i/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False

1o4xzxq,"Found out my ex is dating again, 7 years gone, absolutely soul crushing.","Just absolutely crushed. Had some mutual friends spot my ex with an obvious significant other, in a place I love nonetheless. She didn't see my friends, but my friends saw her. I gave in and texted her letting her know I was happy for her. I have not contacted her in 2 months, been broken up for 5 (I guess), but I'd guess this has been on for a while.

We dated for 7 years (almost), had talked about marriage, kids, my family knew and loved her, and in my opinion, very compatible with work (but with a lot of work). I'm largely to blame for everything crumbling at the end, I spiraled out of control due to a number of reasons. She also has wanted to get married and has generally been more excited about children than I, and I wasn't making any moves (I have a lot of past trauma, divorce, very cautious). We argued, we weren't perfect, but the time invested into her has a lot of value, and she lasted this long with me (nobody else ever has, and I'm in my late 30s).

I never got closure, there wasn't even really a clear breakup, just me continually telling her I wanted to make it work and getting rejected. These last 5 months I've been working on myself, improved my financial situation (that was a huge cause of problems, I was completely irresponsible and lost). The last I spoke to her in person, she said she wanted me get right so we could get married and start a family. For context I had moved away so I could figure my situation out, and we haven't seen each other since, and I've occasionally reached out to her as she never gave me a hard ""stop contacting me"" but more of the ""I'm enjoying dating myself, I'm not seeing anybody."" I think this part hurts the most, never getting any real closure after having invested so much of my life. I am so madly in love with her but I know I didn't make her always feel that way. It's hard when you're in a dark place, and it was hard on her, and I understand.

I have a great job, income, flexibility, and I'm not ugly, so all hope is not lost. I'm grateful for what I have, but I'm really really struggling right now. I've been holding out hope for this woman for months, a lot of tears (I fucking cried in a club one night by myself lmao), but I can't make her see what I see and she genuinely might be so much happier now.

1o4xceb,Five years of love ended because we came from different worlds,"I badly need an advice üòû
I (24F) was in a long-distance relationship with my boyfriend (30M) for five years. We truly loved each other. He is an Arab , he  was my first boyfriend, and we were both serious and legal on both sides.

We come from different faiths ‚Äî I‚Äôm Chris tian and he‚Äôs Mus lim. At first, he said he could marry me despite that. He even encouraged me to study his faith, and I did for a while, but I paused because of school. He was always warm, patient, and supportive ‚Äî the kind of man who listened to my problems and never judged me.

But as time passed, he started to grow distant. He said he was busy, and our communication dropped to just a few texts a day. Even on weekends, when he spent time with family or went out, he rarely made time to talk. I tried to understand him, but I started feeling more and more alone.

One day, I asked him honestly if he still loved me. He said yes, but after I asked again, he admitted that his father had once asked him to meet another woman ‚Äî the daughter of his father‚Äôs friend. He didn‚Äôt go, but the thought shattered me.

Later, he told me that he could see me in his future, but it was ‚Äúblurry.‚Äù He also said his mother wanted me to convert to his faith if we were to marry. I thought about it deeply, and at one point, I was even willing. But when I asked him for assurance that we truly had a future together, he couldn‚Äôt give me one.

Eventually, we broke up. But he still messages me sometimes, saying he misses me. I remember him saying before that if our relationship didn‚Äôt work out, he would accept an arranged marriage ‚Äî and that hurts even more.

Now I‚Äôm trying to focus on my studies and an important upcoming exam, but my mind keeps going back to him. I still love him, but I also know I can‚Äôt keep breaking my own heart.

How do you let go of someone you still love so much ‚Äî someone you were willing to change everything for ‚Äî when you know it‚Äôs impossible to betogetheer? 

TL;DR:
I (24F) loved my boyfriend (30M) for 5 years in a long-distance relationship. We were serious, but we have different religions ‚Äî I‚Äôm Christian and he‚Äôs Muslim. His family wants me to convert, and he couldn‚Äôt promise me a future unless I did. I was willing to, but he still couldn‚Äôt assure me. We broke up, but he keeps messaging me saying he misses me. I still love him deeply, but I‚Äôm heartbroken and don‚Äôt know how to move on.

1o4x617,Tbh i feel lost,"My ex-boyfriend and I were together of three years. We meet in college and our relationship quickly got co-dependent and intense, not in a bad way, due to our school we hanged out every day almost all day, worked together and either go back to his place or mine to sleep.
We always talked about this problem but never did some real chance about it

Early this year he was diagnosed with depression.
He was sent to take some bloodwork to check what kind of in balance he had. He never did.
For months i helped him to find his first psychiatrist, he took his antidepressants but felt they were not helping. He was going to therapy, going to therapy, exercising and didn't felt a change.

Back in july he could not handle his emotions anymore and he broke up with me.
He said he couldn't be in a relationship at the moment and he needed to figure out some stuff by himself.
The breakup took me completely by surprise it was an overnight change.
We didn't talk for about a month, it was the worst time of my life but i slowly started to creat a routine and come through with my grief.

After that month we saw each other again and we talked a lot over processing everything, we were okay.
Later on he confessed some really worrying self harm conducts so I felt like I had to inform his family because it was not my place to handle that anymore.

He did told his family and everything worked out alright.

As for us we had a relationship relapse.
We were honest, he said the wanted to get back together he just wanted to work some things out but he wanted to still talk to me, make plans etc.

We were under the agreement of work on ourselves individually but with the intention to get back together.

For a while it worked, then he started to get distant  and i was the one trying to make things work again.

Last Thursday we had kind of a fight where he told me that during the month that we were not together he was getting the hang of being an individual until he saw me.
I had a small panic attack and told him that i was tired of feeling anxious and being the one trying to chance and adjust.
I told him that even though this decision makes me sad i'm not scared anymore of actually stepping back and end the relationship completely so  he gets the help he needs and i can work on myself on the things I want to change.

He didn't say anything but ""i'm sorry for all the damage i've caused "" 

He has said to me he loves me and wants to get back together. He says he needs to be alone but he doesn't let me go.

I love him, i want him to be better, i want him that when he is in a better place he comes and finds me.

So, i've been thinking of writing him a letter to let him know i'm not mad, i just needed to accept that part of that co-dependency is the fear of letting go and we need to learn to live without that fear, we need to lear to love without fear, pressure, conditioning and do it kindly, freely and sincerely.
I'm torn between continuing on 0 contact giving him space or braking it just to let him know where i stand.",crg0202,1760294787.0,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o4x617/tbh_i_feel_lost/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o4x617/tbh_i_feel_lost/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False

1o4x46l,My ex is back,"
Ladies and Gentlemen, I need your help.
My ex is back in my life and I know for a fact that its not because he loves me or wants us to be together. I also know that I will always choose him and I need to stop.
For context, we have been on and off for years. At some point I told myself that enough was enough, and began the healing process. For over a year, I worked on myself, mourned our relationship and moved on.
A few months a go, he made a surprise appearance, said that he was sorry and that he was trying to be better and that he regretted everything he did.

Initially we proposed being friends, we acknowledged that both of us held a special place in each others hearts but I couldn't continue with our toxic cycle and he wasn't interested in pursuing anything with me.
And for a while it was just that - until it suddenly started becoming more. All of a sudden we're cuddling, making out, and spending a lot of time together. It's putting me back into that old space of overthinking and digging up old feelings of us being together.
It was great, I thought that maybe it was going to stick this time around. However, he's clearly showing me that I am far more attached to this interaction than he is - that my feelings are far deeper than his is, or ever was.

I know my first mistake was thinking that I could be friends with the only person I ever truly loved but also the only person I allowed to hurt me continuously over years - but I really believed I had moved on and made peace with that relationship.

Now, I am at my kitchen table, typing this to an internet of strangers and asking them to tell me how the hell can I get out of this??
I know the clear answer is say goodbye and completely remove him from my life but it doesn't work. God knows that I've tried that for years.

I need to reverse this mistake.",Weekly-Emergency-755,1760294668.0,1,1.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o4x46l/my_ex_is_back/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o4x46l/my_ex_is_back/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o4x2bf,Coping with the failure,"I (26F) broke up with my ex (26F) a month ago. We were dating for 4 and 1/2 years and got along swimmingly. She's an amazing person! She is so unique and genuine. She has never judged me and always holds me with kindness. She is loving and sweet and I felt safer with her than I have anyone else. We would play games and watch anime and go to concerts together. It was legitimately a good relationship, there were many reasons I stayed as long as I did.

But she had ADHD and an addiction to weed, and despite telling me that communication was important, she would shut down when it came to the hard topics in the relationship. I started having trouble with the lack of communication, the mental and physical energy it took to keep up with her chaotic whirlwind of existence. I loved her energy and spontaneousness, but I couldn't keep track of the whole household for us both. Housework was mostly done by me. Yard work was almost always done by me. She could never remember anything and forgot my birthday at one point . She had raging RSD and some small anger issues, and though I never once was afraid of her, I was constantly walking on eggshells. As someone with mental illness, I am intimately aware that the brain is not always ours to control, but it is up to us to each work on our issues and wounds.

I talked to her. Many times. So many I lost track. I started bringing it up 2 years in. Then more often. I tried to be firm, and she said she hated herself and shut down. I tried to be gentle, and she couldn't seem to hear me. I avoided criticism and confrontation and she couldn't seem to hear me. I tried to be blunt and up-front, and she started making excuses. I suggested couple therapy for better communication and she laughed it off. She would work on the behaviors I mentioned as examples for a few months ago most, then stop once I was satisfied. But nothing ever stuck. Rinse and repeat for two years. I think these attempts were the reason I stayed so long, but all of the researching I did to learn about her condition told me the change wouldn't stick until the ADHD was treated, and I told her this. 

All I wanted was for her to TRY treating her ADHD, because it was beginning to affect me just by being such a large part of her life, and I knew this chaos wasn't good for my own mental health. But she wouldn't. I'm not even really sure she wants to. I've come to accept that this isn't wrong of her, it's just not something I can live with in a partner for the rest of my life.

And I just couldn't do it anymore. I was so burnt out and exhausted from managing this person that I loved so dearly, when I shouldn't have been managing her at all. Despite all of my love and effort, I couldnt get my lovely, wonderful horse to drink the water. So I broke up with her and moved out and lost my home and my fur family, because I knew I had to start considering myself. Even now, she still can't seem to hear what it is that I was wanting. Though the breakup was amicable, it's still been really painful.

And so I did try. I talked about it a lot. And even then, it just wasn't enough. I feel so defeated, like a failure. I hate myself for being unable to just love this woman and be ok with her faults.

1o4wm3x,Letter to my ex,"Letter to My Ex

I wonder if you‚Äôll ever read this. Maybe you won‚Äôt. But I‚Äôm writing anyway  not for you, but for me.

I was temporary. That‚Äôs the truth. A stopgap to fill the void your first boyfriend left. A presence to make you feel alive. You told me I made you feel good, like we‚Äôd known each other forever. Maybe you meant it. Maybe it was just a way to keep me close. And when you walked away back to comfort, back to love, back to someone else I took the full damage. I cried. I begged. I stayed. I gave you everything I had. And in return, I learned what it feels like to be erased.

I loved you deeply. Head over heels. From the moment I met you, I fell in love. I still carry it, though I mostly heal now. Even so, I will never hate you. I know you were hurting too, and I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt see it sooner. I wish you‚Äôd have opened up to me. I wish you‚Äôd have fought. But wishes don‚Äôt rewrite the past.

I am no longer the person who gives their heart blindly. I‚Äôve learned that love is not surrender. It‚Äôs choice  careful, deliberate choice about who deserves the version of yourself that can feel intensely, dangerously, fully. I still crave love not you, not the illusion you created  but connection, the feeling of being truly seen. And yet, I will protect myself from attachment without reciprocity. I‚Äôve seen what happens when I don‚Äôt.

You live your life now. Maybe you find happiness, maybe you don‚Äôt. It doesn‚Äôt matter. My pity for you is all I carry  not anger, not hope, not longing. Recognition that your choices shaped the story, and I will no longer let that story define me.

Thousands of enemies couldn‚Äôt hurt me the way your absence did. But I survived. I will survive again. And next time, I will be the one building the safety net  for me, not anyone else.

If I could go back, I‚Äôd do it all again  differently, wiser, but still fall in love with you. Even if it ended the same. Even if it hurts the same. And now, this is my final goodbye. I hope you succeed. I hope you are happy. And I hope you think of me, just once, with clarity, not fantasy.

I write this not to be understood. Not for you. I write this to reclaim myself.

1o4w5h9,Need advice on how to move on,"I need advice on how to move on as I feel my situation is a little trickier than what I found advice for online.

I met someone at work, we worked together for a year then grew close to each other, as the work place was toxic, and going through financial issues. We were all we had and we supported each other through it, I guess you could say we trauma bonded.

One day, 2-3 months into the relationship we go out on a coffee date and we start talking about our future. She was insistent on getting married fast, I wanted marriage too but the situation at work was just too unstable (by unstable I‚Äôm talking the company started running out of cash because our boss was a dumb knucklehead and we were actually going months unpaid). I kept stressing that I want her, I want the future together, I just needed time to get myself out of the mess onto something stable so I am anchored in myself.

At first she was patient but then she started being cold and pulling away and I could feel it. It got worse and worse over time, all the while I was trying to keep our relationship together, keep the office together (so many people quit) and look for another job. She got an offer for another job and broke up with me a few months later. 

Someway somehow I go stuck in that job for a couple more months before I got an offer an moved out. I took the first offer I got with less pay but more stability. We were casually texting each other and just checking in each other during this time, and I never stopped wanting her. 

Five months into my new job, we were texting and she told me that there is a position vacant at her company (an international office, better than where I was) and that she recommended me. I got an interview and got the job. A couple of months into getting the job and getting through the probation period I proposed.

She said she would think about it, and it‚Äôs been a month now and she hasn‚Äôt gotten back to me at all. I gave her space because I asked a week in and she said she wanted time to think. All this time we were doing well at work and communicating well. She would flirt and I would flirt back and all the signs indicated that this could be it. I just learnt today through a mutual friend that she didn‚Äôt want marry me anymore. 

I feel so heartbroken because during the last year and a half I worked my ass off to never be in a situation like I was financially. I built myself up, I anchored myself in so I could provide for her and love her. I felt so betrayed and hurt. As she didn‚Äôt talk to me all this time, I‚Äôll open up the conversation this week and end it for good.

The thing is we would still be in the same office. All the advice I read about blocking her out of all social media and cutting all contact is fine but I would still be seeing her everyday.

Any advice on how I can move on in a situation like this?

1o4w396,It feels wrong to move on so quickly,"I've dated this guy for a few years, we are college aged and we met in high school. As I ""grew up,"" I kinda realized that I didn't want to be with this person long term. I also became far too focused on school. I definitely fell out of love, though it took me a few months to actually officially break up with him because at first I didn't really realize what it was that I was feeling. He also crossed some boundaries that I had set, repeatedly, and that is what I think led me to lose feelings. I actually just got irritated and uncomfortable around the idea of being intimate at all with him after certain boundaries were crossed. 

We mutually agreed we like each other as friends, we had a long conversation about it. 

I haven't really felt sad though. I haven't been looking for a relationship either, but I haven't cried, I haven't wanted him back in that way at all, but it's only been a couple of months. We still talk, but significantly less especially since college started, and I have no romantic feelings.

We both struggle with depression, but I was actively getting help, trying new meds, and finally feeling like myself again, genuinely happy and hopeful.

1o4vz39,Ex broke up despite intense connection‚Äîhow to interpret her behavior?,"I‚Äôd M38 like to get some perspectives on the dynamic with my ex, F35, with whom I had a short but very intense relationship of about four weeks. From the start, she showed a lot of affection and sought strong physical closeness, passionate messages where she expressed her feelings. She places a high value on her autonomy and freedom.

She has two children from a marriage she divorced five years ago. Since then, she has had several relationships with unavailable men (married). She has primary custody of her children, except for one weekend out of every two and not on Tuesdays or Thursdays, and often uses her free time to see her friends. Despite that, she quickly projected herself into a future with me, believing she was ready for a committed relationship and even considering introducing me to her family and friends before the end of the year for the first time since she divorced.

During the last week of our relationship, she alternated between closeness and distance, fear of losing me and moments of complete silence (I never pushed, always giving her the space to come back on her own) before ultimately breaking up. She told me that my behavior had been perfect, but that she didn‚Äôt feel up to the relationship. Ten days after a no-contact period, she reached out to check in, then a week later invited me to a game night at her place in two weeks, she started following me on Instagram on Friday and signed up for a badminton activity I was organizing today. I saw her then, three weeks after the breakup. During that meetup, she was very playful and cheerful, but when I tried to speak with her for ten minutes after badminton, she seemed a bit awkward and waited for me to bring up the breakup before responding. I told her I understood her decision and that it was the best choice for her at that moment to calm her fears. I never smothered her, but she always worried that seeing her only once a week wouldn‚Äôt be enough for me.

Since the breakup, she maintains a light but controlled connection: teasing, shared moments of complicity, but no overt warmth and no discussion of the relationship or her feelings. She continues to talk about me to her friends, which shows a latent interest, while protecting her autonomy and controlling her emotional exposure.

Tonight, she sent me a message saying she was happy to see me. When I didn‚Äôt respond immediately, she followed up 30 minutes later with: ‚ÄúHave a good cinema session :)‚Äù.

I‚Äôm trying to understand how to interpret this mix of withdrawal and latent attachment. Is this typical of an ambivalent or disorganized attachment style, and is a return to a closer, more affectionate form of relationship possible? What behaviors or signs might indicate that she genuinely considers reestablishing a more intimate connection, or if she will continue maintaining this distance out of fear of commitment?",Next_Amoeba7830,1760292056.0,2,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o4vz39/ex_broke_up_despite_intense_connectionhow_to/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o4vz39/ex_broke_up_despite_intense_connectionhow_to/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False

Last week he messaged me that wanted to see me last time and give me a final kiss. I accepted because on the same day I was stalking his ig and I wasn't over him actually. On the day we met, we had a dinner near his apartment, and then we went to his apartment together. Things happened like before we broke up. After he explained some bs which were not sincere at all and started to kiss me deeply which wasn't like a gentle final kiss. And then we moved to the bed. Before we slept, he kissed me a lot again and hug me to sleep. I didn't regret these things because I really wanted to have a sex with him.

However, yesterday I went to his apartment again to grab my card (he was traveling). I met the girl roommate just sit in the living room and very close to his room. I also know that he also had sex with the girl after we broke up. He even told me about this girl's life experience before and even knew she didn't want a kid which didn't match his needs.

My ex (33M) and I (31F) broke up yesterday after weeks of arguing and discussing our differences. We were together for nearly 2 months only cos we met on a dating app.

1o4v012,Why does my ex want to get back together?,"I (29F) dated my ex (31F) for about a year. I broke up with him a little over a year ago due to mainly being really unhappy in the relationship. The first 6 months after we broke up, we kept it low contact, but cordial. After that, he all of a sudden seemed very keen on getting back together and working it out. The things that led to our break up range from him being low effort and bad at listening/accepting boundaries to us just genuinely being incompatible and literally living across the country from one another. I tried addressing these things with him in the relationship, but he always brushed me off or made excuses. I asked for couples counseling multiple times and he just ignored me. So I made the tough decision to end the relationship and try to move on.

In the time that we've been broken up, I've realized just how incompatible we are and I've expressed this to him, but he is almost desperate, saying he can change even super basic things about himself like enjoying going on walks or being in nature as long as he's doing it with me. I feel like one, even if he could change, it wouldn't last because how much can you really change for someone else and two, he shouldn't have to change who he is for another person. He should be with someone who can meet his needs, shares the same vision for the future, and enjoys doing the things he likes to do, but he insists that I'm the only one for him because I'm a ""good person.""

It's gotten to a crazy point where he's now rented an apartment in my city literally across the country from where he has a house and his business so that he can work on our relationship, even as I've been clear I don't think it will work. He's done this even though I've said I need space and have been low contact with him again.

I fundamentally don't understand why he can't just accept that we're not a good match and move on... He's extremely successful, kind, and generous. There are a lot of women I'm sure who would be a better match for him than me. Can anyone provide some insight into why he can't seem to let this go? Or what's really going on here? This whole thing genuinely makes me so anxious because I do care about him and think he's a great person, but I'm now questioning everything and struggling to figure out what to do about this situation.

If I ever think about it I start crying. Balling my eyes out actually. It doesn't happen when I think of him or our past, even the parts where we were in love. Just the particular times when he hurt me. Hurt here refers to being completely emotionally dismissive, emotionally unavailable, being straight up mean and disrespectful. It think I cry because I trusted and loved this man sooo much. I expected that in times of hardship I'd turn to him and he'd be there. But it was the opposite. So yeah it's almost as if I have a ""wound"" that needs healing.",flowerandmoons_,1760289495.0,2,0.75,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o4uuw1/can_you_get_an_emotional_wound_later_in_life/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o4uuw1/can_you_get_an_emotional_wound_later_in_life/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o4urzh,Im out meeting new people but deep down I still wait for him. I dont think ill find someone like him ever.,"Im from a city,F, Very hard for me to find someone who would prefer to live outside the city. Also hard for me to find someone with the exact personality My ex had, We were so open to each other and would make jokes all the time that not everyone can tolerate in the city. We were neither Liberal nor Conservative, Just Moderate and it is already a huge dealbreaker for many People who live here.

I feel like im meeting new people for a distraction only because at the end no matter how hot they are if their personality and Dream future Country life is not their goal we will never work out. Even worse, Most guys I meet only wanna hang out in the city, it overwhelms me I don‚Äôt enjoy being out there. I like chilling where im at and enjoying the calm life over here.

I broke up with my ex because he never saw himself getting married ever, Huge risk because of his job divorce rates. He said He doesnt have feelings of Love for anyone only liked me a lot he doesnt know what Love is.. Sounds pathetic. But deep down If he were to change and suddenly see the love I gave and how much we were getting along and agree that one day he would want to get married, Id come running back. 
Maybe he lied, Maybe its true that he doesn‚Äôt want to get married to me specifically.
I still keep in contact with him just because I actually enjoy being able to have a person who I can say absolutely anything and he would understand. I dont have any irls around like he was.

1o4ujqx,We broke up. Is it really my fault what should I do,"I have a bf who is 34/M and I am 18/F. We've been together for 15 days, and when I spend time with him, he often shifts the conversation to sexual topics. This sunday  while it havent happened he text me if i was free this sunday night and i respond yes. Then he said i wait at 9:30 at night then he was already infront of my house quick and he wait then.. he ask me were togo i said we should go on tops cebu then. While he was driving he said so many positive things about how relationship and other personal everything was normal and we arrived there at the place. 12 am. Theres many people who still visit at this hours. Then after few hour of sightseeing at tops, we go home then we did. Then after that at his car makes me uncomfortable because of how he touches me, and he always uses certain words to make me think it's okay. He asked me about my private part color and I end up feeling like I'm zoned out, unsure of how to respond. Then he says, ""You don't really like me or are serious about me, right?"" Because I was not responding and let him talk, and said. Fine say it when you dont like to continue this anymore. Then i respond.. Okay to be honest i never really need you, its just happened that day we met and you said you was willing to help me and you complimened me of how i look before. I date because i want to and dont need you stop investing it to me. Then he said rudely okay sure and he told me to get out of the car, so I did, but he held my hand too tightly, leaving me with small bruises. While i was trying to escape then i knock his car so the people would hear me. But he ended up snatching my things my phone bag money and me. He said if i cant pay him back cost 1,200 and i was short of money that time i payed him back 350 in my ewallet and 200 peso in my pocket money when he was the one borrowed my money to pay entrance and othet at tops he didnt bring any cash money. And his bank account is issued he said and i dont know so he still continue of us two to go to tops. He said while he was mad ""Get inside or else i do something rape."" He doesn‚Äôt know that I‚Äôm a virgin, i lied. and I‚Äôm afraid to explain why I‚Äôm scared to give it up because I worry if i tell the truth and get forced to do things that I might regret giving it to any guy. Then he aggressively get my phone when it has password then i asked him what are you gonna do with my phone after you open it? he stated that he will get my phone to delete this contact number. I gave the password and he open it he deleted his own contact number on my phone and check my albums and asked me what are these for he didnt find any single of men there dating but instead he just saw my ex convo of breaking up.Then he mentions that if I decline, I might regret it and he pointed me i get karma will come into play. But then I noticed his true colors; he was like that. He told me thats exactly who he is. He stated, ""Fine, we‚Äôre done, you said this and I said that, and you agreed we‚Äôre finished."" He then stated, ""Alright, I remember our previous date, so you can't trick me... you're not actually that pretty; I picked you because I intended to assist you on the day he noticed me... that time we met before, it was raining, and I was heading home after a job application."" And he compares me to his ex, claiming his ex was more beautiful than I am. And he stated that he can truly find another girl who's better than you, honestly. Then he attempted to ask me for the money he all spent on me.. is this guy for real? Value to date? Then i cried. And ask him i thought you really cared of me you said.. you said so many things you're serious you respect me all of it. Then he just laugh at me and said so many things to point out that it was my fault. When i was crying he kissed me and i didnt like it i just let him so he wont do anything more dangerous i only stare at him while he was doing me i was no mood and feel lost. I look in his eyes were like something off that makes him put out of his character.. he didnt closed his eye but were just white. Then he continue to drive and ask me if we want to go hotel or go home with me i said.. Why do u still asked me that when im already injured and weak.. then he continue to drive and just drop me off on my home and I open it but fell In the car because I lost my strength after that. He didn't even mind to help and just ask if I was okay. Then he shuts the door and drive away. I got home feel nothing but lost and don't know what's on me after that happened.

1o4ty8p,She broke up with me after 6 years. I feel happier about the new start then sad about the end of the relationship.,"She said things have changed in her feeling towards me. She thought about it for more a year. She said she didn't complitely elaborate things i thought we fixed like 2 years agoo (nothing too crazy or serious). It was for me like a cold shower. I gave everything to this relationship, thought until a week ago that she was going to be the girl of my life. A nightmare turned into reality. The dream shattered. I elaborated it over these days. I think i gave her too much.  What i did for her had become obvious to her almost like she didn't recognised what i did for her on a daily bases. She always needed more and more attentions and she felt i didnt give her enough. She said it became monotony. Now I'm more happy that she put an end to it. She said: ""I'd preferred that you would have ended it cause i didnt want you to feel pain"". I said i'm strong enough, you still will be the one to feel more pain about this end not me. And here I am. She broke my heart. Made me feel i couldn't love her the right way, the way she needed. Reality is we were too different, I'm very logic, She's the one instead dragged by the feelings of emotions. Things didnt work out at the end but we both grew together. I'm still happy i got to know her but now we have to go for our separate ways.

I just wanted to share my feelings right now. Let me know what y'all think about this. Am I weird?

1o4stcr,Missing my ex more after months apart,"I was with my ex for about 8 months. For the most part they were amazing and I count it as my first real relationship. I did things over the course of the relationship that I believe made her feel like less of a priority of mine and it led to her breaking up with me, amicably. I‚Äôm not taking 100% of the blame and I do think that we had inherent relationship expectations that were different but now I miss her more than I did initially. 

It‚Äôs been about 8 months now. The first month I was sad, then a bit upset at her. I came full circle in about 3 months or so and was able to continue my life as normal or so I thought. I did a rebound and went on some dates some months later. After a 2nd date with a girl about a week ago I realized I still wasn‚Äôt over her. Now I‚Äôm thinking of her more than before. Maybe I was just trying to distract myself and convince myself I was ready to move on. Suddenly 8 months in I‚Äôm sad. 

We used to cook food together in the kitchen and dance together to 70s music while the food was cooking. I think about that all time, it was so fun. Sometimes slow dancing and other times just silly dances making faces. We used to go walking around to look at little dogs, we called them bugs, and now every time I walk past a small dog I think of her. Everywhere we‚Äôd walk we‚Äôd be holding hands the whole time and when we got tired we didn‚Äôt stop we just switched sides to use our other hands. We went to a concert on our second date and had our first kiss right before the first song started playing and it became our song. Now every time that band come around my Spotify I think of her. Every 70s song makes me think of her to be honest.  

 I wouldn‚Äôt get back with her if I had the chance. What‚Äôs done is done and I‚Äôll stand by that with anyone no matter what. I think she‚Äôs with someone new now too.

1o4sm84,Broken up with 10 times in one year,"I‚Äôve (22F) been in this relationship with this individual we‚Äôll call E (20M). It has lasted over a year, with me getting broken up with about 8-10 times throughout it. Not once did I break up with E, and E has always come back to reconnect every time.

It was never a good relationship, first time me and E had a breakup it was about a month in and was only because they thought I was using them for pleasure (which was not true at all). Another time E broke up with me was before a Thanksgiving family dinner. Another time I got left during Christmas. Then I got broken up with this May.

This led to a month break where I started to finally feel free. I loved E so much, I almost worshipped them. But E was not the best person at all. They were avoidant, a gaslighter, and a narcissist. Most of our fights would be because of their own insecurities. Every time I tried to communicate to them about something I didn‚Äôt like or bothered me, it ended up with me apologizing and begging them to not be mad. I eventually had to give them all my social media logins and my location for them to feel secure- but even then I would still get arguments about where I was.

After May, E didn‚Äôt contact me till July 1st. They told me they understood how they were acting and they wanted to treat me better and have me back. This was insane to me- E never admitted that they were ever wrong so this made me assume they grew and got better only after a month. 

Once E comes back, it doesn‚Äôt get better. I obviously had feelings for them and always acted nice, kind, and caring through text and call. But that didn‚Äôt matter, E still avoided going out in the day with me, only having me over at night- where adult things would happen. Then I would leave every time in the morning, would be even lucky if they walked me out. Once I brought up this weird dynamic to E, we got into a fight again and I got broken up with.

We then reconciled before my birthday, and I had a great day with E for the event. I enjoyed my birthday with them and felt the love i've always had for them. E also seemed like they enjoyed it, we held hands, kissed, played games and won prizes. I dropped E off home then tried to talk to them through text- where I still got dry responses. Two days later E is telling me they don‚Äôt need me in their life and that they don‚Äôt like doing anything with me. 

Two weeks later in September E comes back again. Usually we are no-contact during our fights, but E always texts first. Our no contact will usually last 1-3 weeks. Before we split, I am usually always told from E that my love is a waste and that Im wasting both our time. In a way‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre right. I did waste my time. But I loved them so much to have hope it would work out.

Then things got physical. Lots of angry and confusing emotions from being played with for over a year. We did end up hitting each-other before the big breakup, with each-time ending up with me in E‚Äôs bed after- naked and being held from the person who I presumed loved me enough to keep me again.

We then got into another fight which led to us officially breaking up again. After that, E came back again and told me things they've done while gone. With me asking questions and prying into it because I had a feeling that they weren‚Äôt telling me everything. E then told me I was wasting my time, that they didn‚Äôt care if I was in their life, and that we weren‚Äôt together and weren‚Äôt exclusive.

Not exclusive?

That hurt.

I go on a trip a week later, with us not talking. As soon as I get back, E texts me again. And I fall for it again.

We go on one last outing a few weeks later with E taking me out to places they knew I liked. E told me they loved me, missed me, and wanted me.

We go back to their place and do things. Then I get my hair pulled and a phone shoved in my face. A verification code on my phone.

When we broke up (before my trip) I was finally done with E. I downloaded a dating app to try and get someone to take my mind off it. I never ended up doing anything, and had deleted it already before I got back. But E went through my phone and saw a verification code. They then laughed in my face as if they figured something out and kicked me out at 3am. 

I pleaded and begged E to talk to me, I couldn‚Äôt figure out what to even say though. I still loved E in that moment, but we weren‚Äôt together- E had broke up with me 2 weeks before. E told me many times to leave their life and when I finally try to.. Im the bad guy.

It‚Äôs been a year of this, but now its done. When trying to get my stuff back from E the next day after getting kicked out- E ended up calling the cops.. saying I was a stalker. This appalled me, and I never thought E would do something like that. I was heartbroken, I wasted my time waiting to have my perfect relationship with E only to get the lowest of the low handed back to me.

No TLDR, just a vent. Am I crazy? Everyone told me E wasn‚Äôt good for me but I feel like E genuinely broke me into pieces. I don‚Äôt feel like myself anymore. E is gone from my life forever, I won‚Äôt let them back in again. But it hurts. I know i‚Äôm not the only one with a crazy breakup story, but I feel like this is all my fault. I didn‚Äôt ever do anything to E yet somehow they've made me think that this is all because of me.",seungdaeng,1760284345.0,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o4sm84/broken_up_with_10_times_in_one_year/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o4sm84/broken_up_with_10_times_in_one_year/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o4slxn,He left.,"My partner of seven years left yesterday while I was attended part time law school class. We had our ups and downs and worked through it including drunken physical violence in 2019. This decade after covid settled things were looking up I got a job at a small law firm and worked my way up the ranks getting three years of experience during that time I finished my bachelors and got a high LSAT score and got into Law School. I was so proud. During this time he worked his way up at a sales company that sells tech/software. I told him everyday that I was proud of him for those accomplishments.  In August when I got into law school he broke his leg at housewarming party while I was at law school orientation. I knew he was at the party but didn't know where it was or who was there. Eventually he told me the hospital he was being taken to and I met him there. I stayed with him that night till 1 AM when he was discharged and got him home then attended second day of orientation next day. He had a follow up surgery the next week that I took time off from work from to attend and days after to help with the recovery. Over the last couple months I have worked 40 hours a week while going to school part time on weekends. Last Tuesday my employer told me my work was getting sloppy and that I would be demoted to a contract role sometime next week, Thursday of that week my father was admitted to the ICU for what appears to be pneumonia he is still sedated to this moment but lives across the country so I can't see him immediately. I plan to if things looked worse though doctors say he will recover. Yesterday while while attending class he kissed me said he loved me and I went to class I come home the apartment is mostly empty of his things. In class today I couldn't focus on anything and am losing my mind. I keep thinking what did I do? There is small note about ""drifting"" apart which I just can't believe given I put every free moment I had into caretaking including taking time off from work. I did my best to help him heal was there for the surgery took time off work ran tons of errands,, cleaned urine jugs etc. The only thing I can think of is about six weeks after the surgery I asked him if we could coordinate or if he could run errands since he works from home and had started going out to bar for 8+ hours on the weekends again. He blew up and mentioned something about leaving me in a huff. The next day he acted like the argument was settled and I assumed it was just stress from the injury. Fast forward another six weeks to now and he's gone. he packed up most of his things while I was at class. I was cold called in class today and couldn't remember words or anything outside of this incident. I feel like such a fool and the worst part is I still love the guy so much and can't get the thought of not being able to hold him again out of my mind. What is wrong with me? Why do I keep blaming myself? I know i'm not perfect but the facts are overwhelmingly on the side that I did everything I could with the time I had. He kissed me yesterday morning and said he loved me that then everything was gone. I just want to come home and everything is back the way it was he is there and i'm kissing him telling him how proud I am of him and that's a fantasy now and what I thought was the reality of a week ago. I can't focus on anything it's breaking me and I feel so weak and pathetic for that.",Beautiful-Career8360,1760284326.0,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o4slxn/he_left/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o4slxn/he_left/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o4slrs,Does it get better?,"Hey, so I was in a relationship for 6 years with someone who wasn‚Äôt great to me and we have now ended things after his abuse became knowledge to my friends and family (long story short, he threw me out of his car in the middle of the night with no phone and no idea where I was because he was annoyed when a friend said he likes a certain celebrity and I said me too as in I appreciate them? Not attracted to them and a friend found me and helped me) he has always been abusive but I never noticed it until my friend told my family out of worry for my wellbeing.

Anyway, we have now broke up and he claims he is moving out at the end of the month. This guy is an asshole and has put me through a lot of abuse, he never physically abused me but he would punch and break everything around me to scare me. He smashed my TV, threw his or my phone at me and it would dent the wall, he punched holes in the walls and doors, ripped the doors off of things and basically smashed the whole house to pieces. Once he tried to set fire to an apartment we rented by burning a collection of birthday and Christmas cards I got him because we had an argument about dishes and finances. Speaking of finances, he made me pay all the bills for our home so I wouldn‚Äôt have any funds leftover to go out with friends or buy makeup/clothes/get hair and nails done etc. long story short he is a bellend. 

However, I miss him terribly. I have been struck with a really deep dark depression knowing it‚Äôs over and I know he‚Äôs not good to or for me but the thought of him no longer being around really hurts. I think I may be trauma bonded to him, how on earth can I get over this horrible feeling? Will things ever get better for me? I‚Äôm 26 and feel like my life is over, I wasted 6 years of my 20‚Äôs with this man and pushed all my friends and family away to please him, I know I shouldn‚Äôt be with him but I really don‚Äôt want to let go. What can I do to not feel this way? 

Also he has been telling his family that I am the one who is abusive and that I ‚Äúemotionally abuse him by not allowing him to relax how he wants to‚Äù which is playing video games or not working, he‚Äôs currently working but took 8 months off work to ‚Äúchill‚Äù but did nothing around the house which caused more issues for us. I don‚Äôt want people thinking this way about me as I‚Äôm honestly one of the friendliest and least confrontational people ever, my friends and family know it‚Äôs lies and I have evidence (photos of things he broke and abusive messages he‚Äôs sent me) but I‚Äôd hate for someone to think that way about me. 

Thanks for listening (or reading) to me rant and ramble, I just needed to get my feelings out in black and white I guess.

1o4sgki,Confuse,"Lately before our breakup things between us were really bad. I started to feel like he didn‚Äôt care anymore as if our relationship had become the least of his priorities. Since we were in a long distance relationship that feeling of emotional distance hurt even more. Eventually I decided to end things because of the pain his behavior caused me.

When we said goodbye it was emotional. We both felt that maybe if destiny brought him back to the country we could have another chance.
But even after our breakup he still messages me every few days just to check on me to say he misses me or to remind me that he still loves me.

It confuses me because he‚Äôs the one who made me reach the point of walking away. I‚Äôm happy whenever I hear from him and I still feel love for him but I can‚Äôt tell if he‚Äôs doing this because he truly loves me or because he just realized my value and doesn‚Äôt want to lose me completely.

Our relationship was deep and emotional we shared real love and connection despite the distance but now I‚Äôm left wondering what his messages really mean.",lollipop-3,1760283985.0,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o4sgki/confuse/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o4sgki/confuse/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o4sfwz,Does the pain ever truly go away? And if so when?,"Hi. I've been separated from my 4 year relationship for over a year and a half now. And in that time tones has changed in my life for the better, no doubt about it. But that being said I still find myself thinking of her every now and again. It wasn't the best relationship and I don't think in full honesty I was always treated the way I want to be, and in that same honestly, I wasn't the partner I could be at several points. But it started out so well, and even in horrible times we found real joy in one another, I've never felt happier then when things were going well with her.

Maybe it's the fear of never getting that joy back, I'm not a very happy person and I worry it's because I don't have that in my life anymore, not necessarily her, but that connection and comfort. But I still feel this pain. All she is to me is pain now. I won't think about her for a while and then if I hear news of them or see something it's so fucking painful. And I don't think I'd even have them back anyway? And I doubt they'd have me?

My question is does it truly go away. I'm worried it's going to get in the way of me and dating, or just being happy. My brain is stuck in this latch, and it's saying I can't be happy without her because that's how I used to be happy. If it went away for you, how long did it really take. Maybe I'm already well on my way there but sometimes it doesn't feel like it. And I'd give it all to try again, but it's a fools errand and by heart can't accept it.

Me F34 with M41, he went off on holiday to Morocco last week and is soaking up the sun on the holiday that was meant to be for us both. Im still here working through the hurt and pain of the divorce. 

I broke up with him, due to his manipulation, alcoholic behaviour and daily/weekly insults and financial exploitation. However, I cannot help but miss him, still love him and long for him at times during the day. 

I randomly think of him, see the good times we had and think maybe i should email him a long email detailing everything, but then I stop myself in the process and think maybe it is not such a good idea.

1o4s5db,It gets better ü´∂üèª,"8 months ago i got dumped by someone i truly loved. we were together a year. it was my first love and that pain was indescribable. i thought i was going to die from broken heart syndrome. he dumped me, kicked me out of our apartment, then ghosted me. anytime i tried to ask what in the world was going on and what caused him to do this he would say ‚Äúi need space right now‚Äù. we lived together, had animals together, and were even looking at engagement rings and wedding venues. we never fought or argued either. he just woke up one day and ended it and ghosted like i meant nothing to him. i was left confused and hurt. he never gave me closure and i clung onto hope he would come back. he never did. instead he just replaced me with different females over and over and over again. was ‚Äúdating‚Äù a different female every month and to this day still is. over these past 8 months i have met new amazing friends, found new hobbies, traveled, got a different job, and even change my career path in college. i went from not even being able to get out of bed because i was so depressed because i felt like i had lost my other half to finding love and light in my new life i built without my ex. i became happy and found enjoyment out of this life i had created without him. i have started going to church and reading my bible and connecting more with religion too. looking back i am so glad that relationship ended. it pushed me out of my comfort zone and to grow as a person. i would‚Äôve never became the person i am right now without that pain and hurt. 2 months ago i met my current boyfriend and he‚Äôs treated me better than any man ever has. he treats me with respect and respects my boundaries. he is very thoughtful and not only tells me but shows me how much he appreciates me everyday. i joined this group when i was at my lowest of lows grieving the person i thought would be my forever. for anyone reading this feeling depressed, can‚Äôt get out of bed, grieving a relationship, or feeling lost and hopeless, i was right where you were just a few months ago. hear me when i say this, it DOES get better. there is someone out there you are an answered prayer to. i know it doesn‚Äôt feel like it now, but time really does heal all. today get up and shower. fix your hair and get dressed. go on a walk and reconnect with nature. call up a friend or family member and go see a movie on this beautiful sunday or go grab a bite to eat or even just sit outside on the porch with them. look at all the beauty around you and realize there is more to life than some scummy guy/girl that didn‚Äôt see your worth. even though i don‚Äôt know you I SEE YOUR WORTH. sending love to each and every one of you that had trouble even getting out of bed this morning or that is still in bed this morning. i promise it does get better ü´∂üèª",Objective-Room-6158,1760283265.0,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o4s5db/it_gets_better/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o4s5db/it_gets_better/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o4rzcb,She looks extremely happy while I‚Äôm still trying to move on,"My ex ended things over a year ago after five years together. She always wanted to move to another country but I couldn‚Äôt do it at the time. I tried going freelance so I could have more freedom to travel but it didn‚Äôt really work out. My savings started to disappear and things got messy. She even started helping me financially for a while and I know that was also part of the problem. She said it was fine but I could tell it was slowly changing the dynamic between us. During one of the breakup conversations she said I should be the provider and I guess it just took too long for me to get there.

Around that time she started pulling away and I became needy and jealous. I could feel her slipping away and I tried too hard to keep her. I know I messed up there but I was just looking for some reassurance when I wasn‚Äôt getting any.

Now she‚Äôs living abroad, posting about how insanely happy she is and following her dream. Her life seems to be going great. She‚Äôs even gone a bit viral on social media lately and while I‚Äôm happy for her it also makes me feel like it just confirms how right her decision was to leave me. Like every view, like and comment gives her that dopamine that says she made the right choice, that she‚Äôs thriving and I was just a chapter she outgrew.

I haven‚Äôt contacted her at all since the breakup. It‚Äôs been more than a year now and I‚Äôm sure I don‚Äôt even cross her mind anymore. I‚Äôve tried dating other people, travelling solo, keeping busy with work but I still feel unrealised somehow. It‚Äôs like she left me at my lowest and part of me still believes we could have worked it out if things had gone differently.

After the breakup I eventually found a stable job again and got back up financially. I‚Äôm also doing some side jobs and trying to build something for myself. I‚Äôm proud of how far I‚Äôve come even if it doesn‚Äôt always feel like it.

She removed me from social media about a month or two after the breakup. Even my family. But she didn‚Äôt remove my friends which I still find weird. I never removed any of her friends or family. Her sisters still check my stories pretty much all the time and it really leaves me wondering why do they care??? But at the same time I kind of like that they see what I‚Äôm doing. I think they expected me to fall apart but I‚Äôm actually doing fine. I‚Äôm travelling when I can, doing cool stuff, keeping my life together.

I have good days and bad days, especially on special dates or when something reminds me of her. Sometimes I even think about texting her, like saying I‚Äôll be in the same country or something, but then I realize how ridiculous that would be. It‚Äôs not a movie.

I still check what she‚Äôs up to sometimes. I know I should stop but I guess part of me just wants to know if I ever cross her mind or if there‚Äôs even a small hint of regret. I updated my job on LinkedIn recently and noticed someone from her company viewed my profile. She‚Äôs the only one I know who works there so maybe it was her. But honestly I don‚Äôt think there is any regret. She seems genuinely happy and living the life she always wanted so why would I ever cross her mind or why would she ever want to be with me again?

I don‚Äôt even know why I‚Äôm posting this. I guess I‚Äôm just tired. It‚Äôs been so long and I still can‚Äôt fully let it go. I think what really hurts is wondering if I ever actually mattered during those five years. Was it just comfortable? How easy was I to forget? We will never ever talk again...

We were inseparable for weeks. But then, after a few weeks of seeing less and less of each other in person, she ended it all. I was blindsided. I felt like I had to throw up. It was a horrible experience.

1o4rfrr,Struggling with forgiveness and jealousy,"My ex and I split about 6 months ago and things have been eating at me lately. We were together for around 8 years engaged with 2 kids. She was wishy washy with marriage as she was divorced from a marriage that lasted 6 months. I always wanted to be married but I had accepted that it probably was a forever engagement. 

We had been struggling for the past 5 years and decided it was best for the children to split. There was no cheating in our relationship (at least none that I know of) we always did fine communicating. 

The last three years or so were awful. I‚Äôm not a super emotional person, but I was brought to tears multiple times with things she would say to me. These ranged from being told I should be so thankful that she was so pretty and I was dating out of my league and that my male organ was ‚Äúsmall‚Äù. Sex started to dwindle so I resorted to watching porn which was then an issue because she didn‚Äôt want me to watch it. My thought was at least I‚Äôm not cheating on you since you don‚Äôt want to be intimate with me. I tried to do what I could to help our issues. We went to couples counseling and I took it very seriously not leaving any of my faults out when we spoke. At the end the counselor kind of put the spot light on her. I was then told the counselor was misogynistic by her due to him mentioning pmdd and the fact that she is so unsure of everything. 

I‚Äôve now gotten a new gf and everything is going great but I‚Äôm full of anger and some jealousy. For the first time in years I feel that I actually have someone who is genuinely interested in me and cares.  She doesn‚Äôt talk down to me and we are getting along great. I‚Äôm very thankful for her and don‚Äôt want to carry baggage from before and ruin this. 

I had hoped we would be together forever and raise our family. I‚Äôm struggling with her new bf being around the kids, being with her, and him being with her family. I know it‚Äôs so dumb and I don‚Äôt know why I would even be jealous when I feel I was literally dehumanized living with her. 

I recently went to a counselor and pretty much had a venting session but I don‚Äôt know if it helped or not. It was great to talk to someone since I rarely talk about these things and usually keep them in, but I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs going to help me forgive myself for allowing this to happen to me and to forgive her for treating me the way she did. 

We are currently going through legal issues due to her changing our custody agreement without telling me. The part she changed was me meeting her bf before he was around the kids. She said ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt deserve to meet him and with that clause in I had too much control over her‚Äù mind you she is the one that put the clause in our agreement. I think this is where most of my anger stems from. I was doing somewhat fine until this happened and now there are nights I struggle falling asleep because I‚Äôm so upset at what she did. 

Does anyone have any advice for me to overcome this or are there certain counselors that might be able to help me more than others? Im a very go with the flow type of person and feeling like this is not normal for me. I don‚Äôt want these feelings to continue on.

1o4rb1j,Trying to rebuild life after divorce and need ideas for hobbies and activities,"Hi all,  
I‚Äôm in my late 30s, going through a divorce after a 16-year relationship. My wife cheated and left me about 3 months ago. It‚Äôs been brutal. I‚Äôm trying to stay afloat, but I‚Äôm really struggling with loneliness and figuring out how to rebuild my life. I'm realizing that I relied on her for a lot of my social fulfillment.

I now live alone in the suburbs between DC and Baltimore. I have some chronic pain/physical limitations (back, feet, arms) which limits what I can do physically and honestly, I think that contributed to the marriage breaking down.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing now:

* Light exercise 3‚Äì4x/week (short walks, gentle workouts)
* Weekly divorce support group
* Weekly therapy
* 1‚Äì2 friend phone calls per week
* Board game meetup every other week
* See local friends every other week (I have about 6 local friends)

That adds up to about 3, limited social things per week, but I still feel really isolated. I have a dog, and a job that‚Äôs super easy and I work from home. I'm not really interested in pushing my career any further. I‚Äôve got a lot of free time.

My hobbies are mostly solo: reading, meditation, crosswords. I‚Äôm open to hiking or nature walks once I rehab my foot. But I *really* want to avoid falling into a routine of just watching YouTube or TV every night and slowly wasting away. I definitely need to figure out new hobbies and make more friends but I don't even know where to start.

It feels especially hard being a guy in this stage of life. I don‚Äôt like sports, and most of my friends have families and young kids, so it‚Äôs hard to find time or shared interests.

**What do other single guys do to feel engaged, social, or purposeful?** Especially if you don‚Äôt have a super athletic lifestyle or a big local friend group?

Would love to hear any advice, ideas, or even just encouragement.

1o4qvof,He doesn't want to stay with me or let things go,"We're both 25F and 25F we were married for less than 6 months after 5 years of relationship (college sweethearts) we had a pretty messed up broke up. Cheating and I lost a baby. We haven't been together for 6 months now but we were in contact due to I was pregnant. 

I have told him we're not together and there's no baby anymore so, we shouldn't talk to each other because we have ended up having sex and acting as a couple (love u, love you too) and telling about our days and I was okay with it until he told me he was planning to move to other country. I told him ""okay, I hope everything goes good for you there"" but I was crying inside. 

After I told him about stop talking to each other he told me that ""things"" were so messed up and maybe in the future we could be together because there were so many wounds and hurt. I told him to stop talking about the future when he's moving out to other country on February. I told him I wasn't going to wait for him and wanted to file for divorce (he always refused to do it) so I could become au pair an improve my English. 

Now he told me everything was so difficult but he was open to talk and discuss to take a couple of months in NC to things about everything. (2-3 months) he told me ""okay, I'll give you space and then I'll reach out to you"" I told him ""I've been very clear, I don't want a situationship"" he ""don't want that either. I mean together as couple"" 

I don't know what to do. I do still want to be with him and Im feeling anxious not talking to him but I know if keep taking to him I'd end up hurting myself.

1o4qkcn,How to navigate the situation,"I '34F' and my boyfriend '33M' broke up mid July when we were planning to move in together to a new apartment.. we were together for around 1.5 years. I was very heartbroken but I was the one who initiated the break up. 

Ever since we broke up we have seen each other multiple times and I thought we were giving it a try again. But he broke up with me 3 times again after that. We never got physically close after the break up in July because I wanted things to be slow and I wanted him also to be sure. But he repeatedly tried getting back just to break my heart again and again. 

Is there any pojnt in me wanting this to work again? 

We broke up for multiple reasons including finances. I am willing to make some changes and compromises, but would that be enough or should the compromise come from both parties. 

He always doubts me on everything. Ever since the break up i lied about telling one of his friends that we broke up and he started questioning everything during our relationship if i have been lying. I texted his friend just to let her know that we are not together and he is stressed about finding a new place. I did lie to him that i did not tell her, but i accepted that i did tell her after a few times of him asking. He values telling the truth more than anything, but i wasnt thinking a lot when i lied about texting his friend to just inform her that we broke up.

Recently we ended it fully it was from her side but she said she had moved on a long time ago and was sticking around with me to see if it eventually would work (she wasnt trying to make it work) and im just left confused, because she was still saying she loved me a week before we ended and was still acting normal. im just in awe like how could she move on that fast and she immediately started following new dudes and etc etc. I am lost how someone i was with for 3 years moved on that quick and could just move on to new people when we talked about a future together and had so much planned out. It feels like im the one stuck dealing with all the pain of it while shes having the time of her life with these other dudes and her friends.

1o4qcsz,I don't know who I am without him,"I was recently left after a 7-year relationship, and I can barely find the words to describe how it feels. Things have been stormy between us for a long time, but I never really thought it would end. We always found our way back to each other, no matter how bad things got. I truly believed we would again this time too. But now he‚Äôs gone, and I‚Äôm standing here trying to understand how everything that was ‚Äúus‚Äù suddenly became just ‚Äúme.‚Äù

I met him when I was very young, and it feels like my whole identity was shaped around him. Everything I‚Äôve been, everything I‚Äôve done, everything I‚Äôve dreamed about, it was always about us. And now that he doesn‚Äôt want to be part of my life anymore, I don‚Äôt really know who I am without him.

It‚Äôs such a strange feeling. I don‚Äôt even feel sadness in the way people expect. It‚Äôs more like I‚Äôm walking around in a bubble that‚Äôs about to burst. I function, I take my dog out, I eat, I sleep (sometimes), but everything feels numb. Like I‚Äôm surviving, not living.

I don‚Äôt have close family, and I don‚Äôt really have friends to lean on. That makes it even harder, because there‚Äôs no one to call when it gets too heavy. No one to tell me, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be okay.‚Äù It‚Äôs just me. And my dog. She‚Äôs my comfort, my reason to keep going. But even though she means the world to me, there are moments when I feel like I need more than that. I need people. Connection. Someone who sees me.

I had an entire life built with him, routines, plans, memories. We were each other‚Äôs every day. And now there‚Äôs nothing. It‚Äôs like everything has been erased. Sometimes I scroll through old photos just to remind myself that it was real, that it actually happened. But it hurts too, because I know it‚Äôs over.

The days pass, but the nights are the hardest. That‚Äôs when everything hits me. The loneliness, the longing, the urge to reach out. To beg him to change his mind, to tell him we can fix it. I know it wouldn‚Äôt work, that it wouldn‚Äôt make me happy, but my heart still aches for it. My mind understands, but my heart refuses to accept it.

I still love him. That hasn‚Äôt disappeared just because he left. And I think that‚Äôs what hurts the most, still loving someone who no longer chooses you. It feels like an open wound that never gets the chance to heal.

I feel so small, so lost. I don‚Äôt know who I am without him. I was so tied to him, to us, that I‚Äôve lost the outline of myself. It‚Äôs like a part of me has been torn away, and now I‚Äôm just walking around as a shell of who I used to be.

Sometimes it feels unbearable. I‚Äôve had dark thoughts, but I could never leave my dog. She‚Äôs the only thing keeping me here. The thought of her being alone in this world without me is what stops me. It‚Äôs heavy, but also comforting in a way.

I‚Äôm just trying to survive one day at a time. Some moments I feel a tiny bit of hope. Other times, it feels like everything inside me is falling apart. I don‚Äôt know how to live alone after being two for so long. How to start over. How to rebuild myself from the ground up. I don‚Äôt even know where to begin.

I‚Äôm writing this because I need to hear from others who‚Äôve been where I am now. How do you survive being left by the person you love? How do you find yourself again when you‚Äôve lost who you were? How do you deal with the loneliness, the fear, the emptiness?",Cozywhisp,1760278968.0,4,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o4qcsz/i_dont_know_who_i_am_without_him/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o4qcsz/i_dont_know_who_i_am_without_him/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o4q93m,"He said distance was the reason, but I can‚Äôt stop wondering if there‚Äôs more. Am I in denial?","My ex (24M) and I (24F) did long distance for some months, we were both crazy in love and the more time goes by the more we fell for each other. He is studying in another country and has plans to work there for a while while I am still studying in another country (different continent). We would meet once a month or once in two/three months. We are both so into physical touch and had no clue when the distance would end or how. After spending an amazing dreamy week together, I returned sad and missing him and same for him. It was so hard that two days after returning he broke up with me. With all honesty, I didnt see it coming at all. He said that the distance was killing him but couldn‚Äôt communicate that with me and that those past days we spent together made him realize that no amount of texts or calls could compensate for the closeness and intimacy we had. However, there has been an incident which happened during that trip and which made me think what if this is the real cause. I had a male friend whom I have been friend with since middle school, I showed him our conversation and he said that it was a lot of texting. However, when I told him that this friend is gay (which is true) and that he has a bf already, he didnt care abt him anymore and we continued our trip with no slight change in his behaviour or our intimacy! I even asked him if he wanted me to limit my interactions with this friend and he said that it is alright (I just didnt want him to be uncomfortable and wanted him to know that he is my priority). In our breakup call, I asked him twice if there is any reason besides the distance and if he was upset abt the friend and he denied twice and said he still love me and that i was the most beautiful thing that ever happened to him etc..However, idk why my brain doesnt want accept the distance as a reason given the intensity of our love. I have been torturing myself every single day looking for other dumb reasons, I even wanted to reach out to him and aski him again.

1o4q7ov,I lost the best girl due to my own insecurities and mental health issues,"My ex (30F) broke up with me (27M) a few months ago. This is the second and final breakup. She first broke up with me last September. We had remained somewhat in contact and eventually we started to talk romantically again. At this point she had moved to another state. We went long distance for some months where we alternated visits. Afterwards she moved in with me, and we lived together for roughly 6 months before she packed her stuff and moved abruptly. 

I know why she left. It was my fault. I struggled with mental health issues and I never got any help for them. During this time, work had took a toll on me. I was taking the stress poorly and had several mental breakdowns over work. My ex worked from home and had to see these first hand. I know I scared her. I would never put my hands on her but even still showing signs of anger is a huge red flag. My ""solution"" was to look for another job. Well a few months into the first mental breakdown from work I had accepted a job in a new city. We were both happy to move to this new city. When we went to look for apartments I got very overwhelmed. I started to overthink my decision. What if the job is just as bad? Why am I doing this if the pay isn't as good? I like the people I work with what if I dont like the new people? Well I ended up telling them I no longer wanted the job. Shortly after I began looking again. A month later I had received another job offer in that same new city. This job had some red flags which also made me question if it was the right fit. Again I decided to take the job. I was still overthinking the decision. Well a few weeks before I needed to start I finally decided to go with it after having another mental breakdown from work. The day we were supposed to look at apartments I could tell something was wrong. My ex essentially said shes unsure about the relationship. She said the relationship wasn't stable and was unsure of moving again to a new city. Being that I was supposed to start the job in a matter of weeks and our lease was ending in a month, we didn't really have much time. We ended up going back and forth and she had decided this wasn't going to work. I left for the night and gave her the key to the storage room where she had her boxes. I was home the next day by early morning. During that time she managed to pack all of her stuff and leave. She didn't have an apartment lined up and it hadn't been that long so I never expected it to happen this fast. 

Now for the issues we had. For the last 6 months or so I was depressed and stressed due to work. When the weekends came around, I was not so enthusiastic to do anything. She didn't want to make plans because she didn't want to see me not enthused to do what she wanted to do. This led to several weekends with no plans and being that she worked remotely full time she was suffering from not going out. She didn't have any friends so it was difficult for her. I knew she wanted to go out so I would ask her what she wanted to do but she wouldn't say what she wanted. Most weekends I would try to make plans and some I just didn't want to do anything due to the depression. This was a bad cycle that contributed negatively to her mental health.

Another issue was I struggled with emotional regulation. She would say I would go from happy to upset. I know my mood was up and down. I would get upset over dumb meaningless stuff. Examples of this were she would do the dishes in the sink but only do her dishes and leave mine ( I would do both), I would be cleaning the house and she would not be contributing, we would both be making separate meals and she would finish a little earlier and would eat without me etc etc. Now the way I went about talking about these issues was not good. I came at her rigidly and put her in the defensive. I should have just talked with her and told her the things that were upsetting me. All of these arguments were over small things. Really not very significant things in the grand scheme of things.

The last big issue was I struggled with fear of abandonment issues. At some points of the relationship I would say things like ""do you really love me"" or ""I love you plus two"" stuff along those lines. The worst thing I would do would be we would get into an argument and it would end in me saying something along the lines of ""maybe we shouldn't be together then"". This happened a few times. In my mind I didn't want to end the relationship. I was insecure, I was scared she didn't really want to be with me due to the other issues we had so when I said these things all I was thinking was im giving her a way out. I know this is manipulative. I know this is fucked up. The final straw of the relationship was me saying I wanted to breakup over a concert. We had previously enjoyed going to concerts together. The year we were friends the first year we started dating, concerts were a huge bonding thing for us. We went to metal shows and I enjoyed moshing. It was a release for me and the biggest reason to go to a show. I was like an addict, going and not moshing was very difficult. Well during the time we were long distance, I went to a concert with a friend and I got hit in the eye. Got a pretty bad black eye that never fully healed. For me this was the final straw. I decided that going to concerts was bad for my health and I no longer wanted to be in an environment like that. The thought gave me anxiety. Well my ex still loved concerts. I thought this was going to be a huge point of contention so I made sure I told her I wasn't going to go but that she should go to any show she wants to before she moved in with me. I didn't want to control her. Well fast forward in time, she decided to go to a show. I had told her to go to the show and to enjoy it. Well when the day came and she said she was getting ready to leave, I broke down emotionally. Afterwards I reassured her and told her please go to the show, I know you want to go. I left the house and went out and drank. That didn't help.. I texted her something along the lines of ""I don't think I can do this anymore"" then I asked her if she could stay the night in a hotel since the show was in a different city and I wanted some space to think. We texted back and forth and it wasn't great. She did end up coming home that night. We talked but nothing was the same since that point. Weeks later is when we broke up. I was a total POS for telling her to go and then saying I cant do this. That cant be described more as manipulative and controlling behavior. Now where my head was at in the moment was the relationship is over because eventually she is going to meet someone else at a concert and leave me. The way I met her was at concerts from a mutual friend. When I met her, she was married. We didn't do anything until she was separated but she had cheated on her ex husband with a mutual friend of ours. Now the two of them went to practically every concert together. She brought up to me that she didn't like that her then husband didn't like metal and didn't go to concerts with her. So I conjured up in my head that she would eventually think the same of me after going to multiple concerts without me. This was my insecurity speaking. It was just the concerts for me. All because I had that association in my head. 

There where a few other issues here and there but this sums it up. The responsibility falls on me. I should have went to a therapist and a psychiatrist and gotten help. After she left she told me she left because ""the relationship has taken a toll on her mental health"". And man do I not see this anymore clearly now. I was a toxic partner who was emotionally abusive at times. Was that my intention no, was it the reality yes. Shes told me now to look into BPD that she thinks that might be it. Its weird because if I ask my family and friends, they don't see the traits. Well anyways im in the process of finally getting help and hopefully can learn some coping mechanisms. I am mentally breaking down over this loss. I do feel very guilty. I deserved being left. I do very much love my ex. I feel a bit hopeless. Without a doubt this was my fault and for what? She was nothing but a great girlfriend. She was right for me in more ways than not. She is my first and only real love as well. All this to say, I didn't deserve her and I don't deserve anyone until I sort out my issues and heal. Its hard for me to accept the fact that I indeed squandered the relationship. That I indeed acted in ways that were toxic. Because in all accounts she is a great person and was everything I wanted in a partner. But I was not mentally well enough to handle the relationship and hurt someone in the process. For that I am sorry and remorseful for. 

  
TLDR: I lost a great girl due to my actions and toxic manipulative behavior. I am now realizing what I have done and am coming to terms with my actions and getting professional help.

1o4q4yv,"I need her in my life, but","i met the girl of my life 3 years ago, we've been dating ever since, She is more than just my girlfriend, she is my bestfriend, my lover, my everything.

Im a person where i kinda hate childish stuff, like a girl getting flustered over nothing and blames it on menstruation or sulk over nothing.
i feel like i dont have time for that kind of relationship and this girl is far different than that, she is like my bro, being there with me throughout my up and downs, loved me when im just driving a honda and when im emotionally inmature.

she never expects me to pay for everything, she tried to pay as well when were out on a date even though shes financially struggling compared to myself at the time. she even took her time to attend a class where i failed for a whole semester just to help me have someone to talk to.

i went through a breakup with her once last year because she had enough of my childish emotions and im tired of her making excuses for her mistake everytime, but this January i chased her back because i couldnt imagine a world where i live without her and i feel that i could give her a lot of happiness with me being changed. i do also feel that i want to make her happy deeply from my heart, buying things that she couldnt even imagine she would get. i know that gifts or monetary stuffs are not everything in a relationship, but im glad i could use my privilege to give her something and her smile is the most precious thing that anything in this world could give me and i want to cherish that moment forever.

recently im opening up about my situation, where i feel like i dont belong in my work environment because they were judging me financially. i was always left behind, never invited for a hangout, and should always be the one to reachout during lunchbreak, if i didnt they would just leave me behind, im tired i have no one to talk to, so i opened up to my girlfriend.

then she started to say stuffs that are not cruel or rude but rather just straightforward and it feels like shes blaming me because i had a privileged life, im trying to see from their point view as well but shes not comforting me at all. I remembered she went throught this type of stuffs as well related to her family but i learned my lesson, people opening up to you sometimes they just wanna be heard and comforted not being given the facts straight to their face so i called her out about it and she said it was different this and that and she didnt say anything afterwards.

i was so disappointed on her response so i just focused on myself and sorting out problems in my work environment and i didnt reply to her messages for a whole week straight. then i messaged her the next week explaining that i'll solve things on my own, and explained my situation in my work environment and so on, she just read it.

then two weeks from the moment i updated her regarding my situation, i messaged her again because my was looking for her and genuinely concerned if there is anything happening to her, my mom sent her a voice note and then 3-4 days later she even called her again but zero response from her.

i messaged her that my mom is looking for her, and shes genuinely worried because my mom always supports the both of us and shes happy when we are together, then i also told her to update me and fix stuffs together, she responded immediately to my mom saying shes okay and my mom invited her to come to our house and she just messaged ""okay when i have a free time"".

its been a week and she just read my messages without any response, next month is my anniversary of the third year with her and also her birthday. One side of my heart wants to go to her and make her happy during the most important day of her life but one part of me also feels like shit if i did that, its as if im letting her control over me and my self respect are being thrown to the garbage, being the only one to always begs for a chance and always expressing my emotions deeply but she does not.

she told me she has emotion expression issues because her mom is cruel to her and never validates her emotions, so all this time i always kept accepting when ever i dont feel loved, i dont feel that shes fighting with me for our relationship as well, its always me fixing all the stuffs, creating solutions , expressing my love to her greatly.

Im tired, but she is my everything.",Ok-Teach8206,1760278428.0,1,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o4q4yv/i_need_her_in_my_life_but/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o4q4yv/i_need_her_in_my_life_but/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False

1o4pwcf,Advice: I want to break no-contact in a weird way.,"Hello, me and my partner broke up a month ago, and it is insane how much reflection you can do in a month. But this past month I just noticed all their bad patterns and how in a way they made me responsible for their identity journey and in way manage their feelings. I am a people pleaser, and I am the eldest of a Hispanic family, which means that I have a lot of childhood trauma and almost no sense of boudaries which is something I'm working on in therapy, and probably played a part into the breakup by enabling their bad behavior. Well the past month I've been journaling and I wrote them a letter of how they me feel. Then I voice recorded that letter and then I set it to be sent in 4 months from the breakup through email. It has kinda calmed that urge to send it right now, but I also don't know if I want to stop it. I guess I'm asking, should let it get sent? Or stop it from getting sent in the first place?

Special notes: We were in a long distance relationship. They broke up with me and when they did, they explained why the relationship couldn't be salvaged and then that was it. I didn't get to say my peace which is why I want this audio file to reach them.

I‚Äôm not here to get her back I know that has to come second, if it ever happens at all. I just finally hit the point where I can see how badly I handled things. I used to think I was trying to ‚Äúfix‚Äù the relationship, but really, I wasn‚Äôt fixing myself.
We were together 10 years and I took her for granted. I focused on being right, not being kind. I thought logic could replace empathy, and I ended up breaking someone who only wanted understanding. Now she‚Äôs gone, and I‚Äôm sitting with the weight of all that.
I‚Äôve started working on myself journaling daily, learning emotional regulation, actually reading about communication instead of assuming I know everything. It‚Äôs really hard facing your own patterns, but it feels like the only way forward.
I don‚Äôt want to be the same person six months from now. Whether she ever talks to me again or not, I want to be someone who deserves peace and stability  someone capable of loving right.
For anyone who‚Äôs been here and actually turned things around after realizing their part I could use some help
I've joined a program that holds me accountable we meet weekly and get chips for progress.  The drive to obtain that next chip for me is almost a videogame drive or career chasing. It's a powerful feeling for me I just know I need more than 1 group. So support here might help too. I keep editing the post after thinking of more. I also needed to add im missing her like hell! Trying my best to avoid contacting her. I just wish she knew how much I'm seeing and how I know I need more time to apply and follow threw. Seeing is just step 1 so if anyone has advice on how to suppress the urge to tell her how sorry you are and how much you realize. I do this alot where I realize then show her then we talk and I break right back down to the same old stuff. HOW DO I POWER THREW THIS!!!! I saw her post... she was devastated i canceled the phone line like she told me too... i immediately called and had ut turned back on. I didnt mean to hurt her... Oh also need to add I know if she did contact me I would tell her I need more space to do what needs to be done. That feeling right there, it shows me I'm finnaly on the right path. Just so hard battling chase for comfort in contact vs knowing to fix. One part of me wishes for subtle contact very limited just so we can stay on the same page of we just need space. This will be my last edit. I'm starting to do my thing again so I gotta stop here.

1o4pg6v,I want him back but I don't know if I should?,"my ex and I broke up after 2 years together. he ended things. he said that he felt like he wasn't in the relationship for himself but only for me. he was afraid that if he left me I'd hurt myself. we broke up before previously because of the same thing, last October (weird coincidence). at first I fought back and tried to keep us working but at the end I just accepted it and he left. in the past he blocked me but this time he just unfollowed me on everything. I of course want him back and I'm hoping he comes back like last time. but I'm not sure. I told his mom (ikr) how I felt and  how I wanted him back. she told me that he told her he was confused about his feelings and not sure what he wanted. she suggested for me to text him at some point before we start school (we're on fall break right now, I'm a jr in hs). but the break ends tomorrow and it all felt so sudden to break things off. recently he started working at our local mall at a store there, target. he told me about his coworker Mia (around 18) and how she was nice. yesterday, I didn't know he was working so I went to the mall to hang out with my friend and he was there. I saw him we made eye contact and I tried not to look again. he was staring at me when we passed by. my friend said he took a picture of me but I don't think so. when I went to get Starbucks he was gesturing to me with one of the guys who was bagging groceries. I texted him ""I didn't know you were working today, I'm sorry if it made you feel weird"". he hasn't replied. but something caught my eye. back to Mia, he put on his note ""age is just a number right"",I think he left me for Mia. it kind of makes sense because a day after he started working he left me. I thought maybe he just felt overwhelmed because I was being too much. I did get jealous about him calling mia nice and I'll admit that I was being overdramatic. but now I'm just wondering how he could leave everything we built for a stranger. I just need some honest advice, I want to get back with him but I don't know if it's time to wrap things up between us. I should also mention that we did start having sex a little while before and before our fall break, he initiated and everything was normal. it was oral and he went down on me, I'm not sure if it's relevant but I want every piece of the puzzle out there for anyone's thought to care.

1o4pd3x,"Left confused, questions unanswered","My ex and I were in a relationship for about a year. We spoke about our future a lot together as our goals aligned. In the beginning he was this great communicator and we talked about everything even through disagreement‚Äôs. In the beginning, I was the one to be on fight or flight mode and he basically changed me out of it as he was so understanding. 

It slowly started to change where every time I would bring up something that I didn‚Äôt like, or to better the relationship, he‚Äôd find a reason to breakup with me or say I‚Äôm too much, or that I‚Äôm too emotional and can‚Äôt handle things ‚Äúby myself‚Äù. Anyway, our last disagreement was his final straw and he broke up with me in the middle of the night and left me in the streets of new york. I begged for him back over and over again. Told him I‚Äôd stop being emotional told him I‚Äôd stop taking things to heart, but he blocked me on everything. It‚Äôs been over a month now and I did reach out to him again a few days ago and he still stands on how he hates me and never wants to see me or talk to me ever again in his life. It really hurts. I know I am a sensitive person, but how can someone just change like this? I feel confused on how he could hate me this much when I asked him he said it‚Äôs because I was the shittiest girlfriend ever. Which also leaves me confusing because I reflected on everything and I was a shitty girlfriend for expressing my needs? The needs he asked me to express in the beginning of our relationship. He wanted me to communicate more and I did and put so much effort into this relationship and now once I do, I‚Äôm the bad person? 

Nonetheless, I want him back unfortunately, and I‚Äôm not sure what to do anymore. It does bother me that he is taking 0 accountability for any of his actions and putting all the blame on me for the breakup. I wish he would at least give me closure but I know silence is the closure.

1o4pcmz,"Broke up with girlfriend because I am not happy with myself, and I feel terrible about it.","(27M) (26F): Last night, I did one of the hardest things I‚Äôve ever done. This is just a vent, any responses would be appreciated. 

 I was dating this girl for 2.5 years. Initially, everything was perfect. She was no hassle, didn‚Äôt play games, was mature, and incredibly caring and supportive. As all couples experience, we have ups and downs. Recently, something snapped in me. The last couple of months, I‚Äôve been questioning our relationship.

I‚Äôm 27 and haven‚Äôt really started my career yet (I‚Äôm working on it now). I‚Äôm not happy with myself and where I am in life, and I‚Äôve been feeling really bummed out. The thought of ‚ÄúI want to just focus on myself and get my career going‚Äù made me feel relieved and hopeful.

Over the last two months, I‚Äôve been conflicted. Just a week ago, we went to my brother‚Äôs wedding, and after that night, things really went south. Seeing the connection and speeches between my brother and his wife made me realize that I couldn‚Äôt see myself saying those things to my girlfriend without lying. After 2.5 years, I should be able to, but I couldn‚Äôt. So, after a week of thinking about this, I ended the relationship last night. It was so hard for me to do.

She‚Äôs a very caring woman, and she would drop anything for me. That‚Äôs what made this so hard. It felt like I shot an innocent little puppy in the face. It was so brutal.

The weird thing is, all those thoughts that I should leave her, focus on myself, get life started, etc., are just gone right now. It‚Äôs like those feelings used me to dump her and then they left because they got what they wanted. I don‚Äôt know if this is normal, but I just feel incredibly awful. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll find another woman like her, but I left felt this needed to happen because she doesn‚Äôt deserve to be with someone who‚Äôs confused whether they want to be with her or not.

1o4ovz9,i‚Äôm making the right decision right?,"I broke up with my boyfriend a couple days ago because even though I love him so much and I want to be with him and I miss him, I couldn‚Äôt handle the constant feelings of: being too much even when i know deep down that i‚Äôm not/feeling of so much doubt/feeling of being unloved and undesired and just tolerated/anxiety/loneliness/lowering of self-confidence that comes with being with him anymore.

when his guy friend and i were alone for a moment, the friend told me that he wanted to take my top off. i told my boyfriend and he didn‚Äôt react. I wanted him to feel disgusted for me but he wasn‚Äôt and he even told me he won‚Äôt dislike his friend just because of that.

when i was in his foreign country, i had a little accident and called him from the sidewalk bleeding and feeling really alone to see if he can move his flexible work schedule around and take the time to pick me up because i had a hard time walking, and he told me ‚Äúdo you know what you‚Äôre asking of me right now?‚Äù

every time we call and i tell him about stuff that happened in my day, he would make a little noise that you can tell, is him being bothered that im trying to talk to him while he plays his video games. when i tell him this bothers me, he tells me that he ‚Äúspends time with me- what more can he do?‚Äù (even if it‚Äôs not really time with me, it‚Äôs time spent playing video games and i‚Äôm on the background desperately trying to connect with him)

he didn‚Äôt clean his apartment before i visited him because he was too busy playing video games.

i told him to take me to the beach. he said no because he hates the beach. then his mom told him she used to love going to the beach, then agreed to take us both.

he would rave about other people but never about me. i would beg for little proofs and atcs of love here and there, nothing crazy, and he can‚Äôt do them consistently without me asking every freakin day. he never asked to post me on social media even though he will with his friends. he didn‚Äôt comfort me when i was bawling my eyes out because his brother keeps ignoring me during family dinners, or any time i would cry tbh. he never got me flowers. he got me one gift. he spends more time and effort to see his friends and on an ex coworker‚Äôs birthday gift. 

Despite all these above and many more, i gave him so much love. I planned everything- our trips to see each other, plans for the day, dinner plans. I went to his country a few times and endured tiring flights (all while juggling a busy life at home). I cleaned his apartment. I made sure food was ready for us all the time during his lunch break and dinner. I grocery shopped for us. I paid for lots of things, more than he did. I did the emotional labor of fixing our relationship. I understood his inability to show love even if it was hurting me constantly as just because he has never been in a romantic relationship despite being in his mid 30s and because he had a rough childhood where he had no friends in high school and his dad abandoned him. I made sure he knew I was always there for him. I made myself perfect for his mom and friends. I tried so hard to be perfect for him to try to impress him with my career and . I would buy him gifts, postcards, etc. 

And in return, I got all the above. I got a lot of ‚Äúbut i do love you‚Äù and ‚Äúi miss you‚Äù but never any action. I got ‚Äúbut I DO spend time with you‚Äù even if the spending time is him playing video games while i‚Äôm just there and ‚Äúyou‚Äôre overreacting, you‚Äôre full of drama again‚Äù

even when we were breaking up, i blamed myself for being too much. he was so convinced he was being an ‚Äúok‚Äù boyfriend when he was barely scratching the bare minimum, and his favorite go to quote is that when relationships have issues, it‚Äôs the fault of both people in the relationship. this was the worst part because he genuinely cannot see how cruel he was to me and how much i‚Äôve done and how little he‚Äôs done for the relationship.

it hurts so much and i just need someone to tell me that i will be okay without him, and that I wont regret leaving him

i really should just focus on my career and hobbies outside of my career and maybe strengthening my female friendships 

he still messages me ‚Äúi miss you‚Äù and ‚Äúive always loved you‚Äù but this is not a reason to come back right?

1o4osy9,Need advice on what to do with an ex,"I'm going to try to make this as short as possible but I would have preferred adding details.

I was in a relationship with a person for around 10 months, we have broken up about 3 times.
First, was because my ex got stressed out because there was active beef between me and a close friend of theirs (we were at a drunk party and accidentally hit him so he threatened me and tried to harm me).
After somewhat reconciliating with said individual, we talked and I told them that their asexuality was not of concern to me and apperantly they thought we were hooking up all this time??? (No idea why we spent a lot of time together and it wasn't even that sexual?). BTW all was resolved because my ex asked me to apologize to person B and I did even though I didn't want to.

Second attempt, I have a conversation with the weird friend from before after kind of trusting him again. I wanted advice on how to deal with my ex's codependency. They started rumbling about how neglected and mad they are about them (basically the person felt, they were spending too much time with me and neglected them). I denied felling uncomfortable by their actions as it was said and got into an argument, I tried to tell that person that maybe they should get more friend but that didn't go well.
I ended leaving the conversation.

Few days, days later I admit to person B that I was uncomfortable by out last conversation and I would like distance at least. Never responded, next thing I know, he cried to my ex. My ex came to me asking mw to apologize to him again, but this time I wasn't having it. So I kept denying them but they kept insisting for me to do so even though I had already apologized and I should do it again to keep the situation from becoming like last time. I ended trying to reason with me.

So they started ignoring me for 2 weeks and rejecting me of any contact in hopes that would force me to talk to them again. I was furious

I ended giving in because I didn't want to lose them.
So we talked, and I explained my side. I asked if my ex could separate us and the relationship from their friends (spoiler alert:no) and they agreed to try again with our relationship.

Fast forward, we argued sometimes but I didn't think we had major issues as of recently.

Suddenly about 1 week ago they started missing my calls and became distant as of september, I thought it was a personal issues so I tried being there for them.
Little did I know they were waiting for the right opportunity to break up with me.
Mind you I was really starting to get comfortable this time.

My given reasons were:
1. I am miserable
2. I feel like a sacrifice so much for you and it's never enough
3. I ask you of things and you always neglect me
4. You always make me the punchline of some joke
5. You always shut down at our uncomfortable conversations
6. You don't get along with my friends

While I do know that I should have toned down the jokes, I don't really agree with the rest.

Apperantly, in their own idea of love, sacrifice is necessary for your partner and you should always try to do be accommodating for them no matter what.
They miss the beginning of our relationship that didn't have problems and I think they holding onto that and only hoped to get that back all this time.

I don't know I just feel thrown out.
Even when they were breaking up with me I begged them for us to have a serious just like we were doing at that moment.

 I feel liked a I tried so hard and no matter what I said they said they didn't believe  me anymore. 

Now they seem happier and I can't shake the feeling that I'm a bad person.
Because that's everyone on their side says. All their friends and I think including them hates my guts.

I tried so many times to make this work and I'm still the bad guy
My friends think well of me and they didn't think we'll of this relationship in the first place.

I miss them a lot and I wanted to text them so many times to beg them for us to figure it out. But at the end of the day I would just embarrass myself and get nothing out of it.

I'm struggling so much these days because our relationship felt fake and I keep holding onto the idea of our fake relationship. I still want us to get back together, even though from what I heard it could never work.

I don't know what to do, I just thought I could hear some advice here?

1o4ole1,How to ask for something back after a break up?,"So, this guy and I dated for around 2 years and broke up recently due to parents involvement. His parents made him block me everywhere, so the other day I was drunk and called him.  

I first ranted to him, how mad I am at him cause he didnt bother to ateast reach out just to see how I was doing. And he gave his reasons and we talked for quite a while and he said he was gonna visit me on the 25th in office since he knew I was working and said that was his original plan. He kept asking if it still mattered if he came by on the 25th and I kept saying no, cause I was very hurt how he didnt reach out when it really mattered. 

Just now, I saw the calendar and realised that 25th is a freaking Saturday, so I wont be working. I physically cannot belive that he lied about it after everything, everything we have been thru. 

I just need him to know that I caught his lie, and that it is smth I did not, at a fucking expect him to do after everything. He still kept saying I love you in that call and I cannot fanthom how he lied. 

I want him to know how disrespectful that is, but I know me reaching out again is gonna amount to no good. I know I simply need to let go. 

It is bothering me is that I gifted him a flute (among others things) from a scared place that means a loot to me. He always wanted to learn flute and I went out of my way to another city to buy him that. 

I dont really care about the other gifts, lucky charms, letters and hand notes I gave him. I did that out of nothing but love and dont regret it. 

I just want that flute back, he doesnt even use it, and it means too much to me for it to be with a liar. 

I need to ask for it back.

1o4o4e2,Life beyond romantic relationships,"I (23f) and have spent too much of my time in romantic relationships. One relationship of 6 years, then a 2 year relationship, until finally the last two-three have been single. 
Im finding it difficult to connect with somebody who values the relationship in the long run.
Someone (25m) I was seeing the last few months broke it off with me regardless of things going well, especially when together. When we started dating, he told me he was looking for long-term so I took him seriously. After 4/5 months of talking, he broke it off because he isn‚Äôt ready to enter a relationship and has other things to prioritize; career change, going back to school and navigating living on his own for the first time and family matters. 

I keep wondering to myself if relationships are something worth pursuing or not anymore. I love to share my love, and I do so with family and friends but i do yearn for a deeper connection with somebody who i can imagine spending my life with. I am somebody who is aware and willing to put work into being with somebody who I can love, but i find it increasingly discouraging to keep dating. 
If i back off dating, I am hoping to find different values in my life and strengths in myself but i also worry that i may never end up with anybody to settle with, it seems that if i neglect dating i would want to give it another shot ever again. 
im wondering if anyone who hasn‚Äôt dated for a long time thinks that it is worth it and has advice for things i can do to fill my own cup. book suggestions, podcasts or just anecdotal advice would be helpful.

1o4o48j,Asking for help with divorce,"

Hello, i""m 33 male and she 32.
‚ÄãThere's been an incident with my wife, with whom I've been married for over 10 years. We've had our ups and downs, but whenever problems arose, I always tried to talk, to solve them, and I would ask her to contribute to solving them as well. It seemed like everything would get sorted out, and we would continue with our lives.
‚ÄãHowever, another person appeared, whom both of us know, and he likes to flirt around with others. My wife claimed he was just a good friend and they simply communicated well. As far as I understood, this communication lasted about a year. We argued, and I asked her to block him and end all contact with him. I had noticed for some time that she was coming home later or certain things were happening. She said yes and did it, but it turns out it was only on one account. I warned her that I would be looking, that I would take her phone and check it, and she agreed.
‚ÄãAfter a couple of days, I saw a text exchange on her other phone. On his side, he was writing that he loved her, missed her, etc., and she was simply 'liking' those words. Seeing that they were planning to meet, I went to her workplace and found them talking together. Eventually, I told her to finish her work and go home so we could sort things out.
‚ÄãOnce we were home, we started discussing, but I could see in her eyes that she wasn't taking it seriously anymore. When I told her to choose him or me, she didn't choose him and started telling me that she wanted a divorce, that she no longer had any feelings for me, and that this had built up over many years when I kept thinking we had talked things through.
‚ÄãFinally, realizing that she wasn't joking and wanted to separate, I started trying to talk her out of it. We talked and agreed that she would block him everywhere and stop communicating, and that no matter the state of our relationship, we would try to make an effort. However, she kept reminding me that from her side, no feelings were left, only attachment and some kind of love. I promised to change my behavior for her and asked for her help‚Äîto not stay silent, but to assist me. I also asked her to completely cut off contact with the other man, and she promised.
‚ÄãThe same evening, after I left on some business, she called him. After checking her phone records, I started asking if she had truly ended the connection. She insisted she had, but when I showed her the phone record, she visibly trembled and was flustered; it was clear from her body language. Eventually, she claimed she called him to say that we had argued, etc., and that she had supposedly ended everything with him.
‚ÄãBut that lie forced me to keep watching her. Eventually, I had left Google Maps live location on and monitored her movements, knowing her plans. There was a moment when I saw her near a store, but the other half of the route had already been taken some time ago. I took a risk and called her with a video call, knowing I would reveal my method. She answered after a delay, seemed slightly out of breath, and I clearly understood she had run towards the store because I know that area from the surroundings. She was displeased that I immediately asked if she was alone and to show me the surroundings, etc. Eventually, this happened at least twice.
‚ÄãWhen the discussion flared up again, her body language reacted in the same way as when she got the call after her promise. But I didn't have solid proof, and eventually we made up, and she said she did those things intentionally the other times because she hoped I would come and check, etc. I told her that she was giving me paranoia and to stop humiliating me, because sooner or later I would find out again. She said she understood that.
‚ÄãA couple of days went by, but I couldn't sleep or eat anymore. It seemed like we were trying to talk, but I kept asking if she had ended the connection with him, and she kept claiming she had blocked him everywhere, etc. Sensing a lack of honesty, I took her phone and saw that WhatsApp had started consuming a significant amount of battery life in the last few days, since the time she supposedly blocked him on other media. I turned on the 'last seen' feature on WhatsApp and the same evening I started seeing her connecting whenever she went to the bathroom or when I went somewhere.
‚ÄãFinally, today, after checking the chat history, I saw a search for ""can you get pregnant after 19 or 21 days,"" etc., immediately. I started talking, and she claimed those questions were related to her sister. Anything is possible knowing that sister. My wife has never prioritized sex in her life and has certain issues, like it being painful, etc., but I had come to terms with that.
‚ÄãFinally, when I mentioned WhatsApp, she kept arguing. When I provided proof of how much space the WhatsApp application itself was taking up versus what the phone showed (a 10% difference after clearing cookies, etc.), she became very angry. And when I started asking for the secret chat code that only opens after entering a code, she pretended not to know what it was. Pressing randomly, I found that the number of the person she was communicating with was not blocked, even in the phone itself, although we had talked about blocking. But the chat was empty, so suspecting another code, she finally declared again that we were separating. There were more discussions, but eventually, as regrettable as it was, I drove her away.
‚ÄãWhile driving, we talked again, and there were promises from my side, etc., but all conditional on her ending the connection, etc. Eventually, she reacted to all of this without emotion, hugged me at the end, and still wants us to separate on good terms. Less than an hour later, I saw another call to him on WhatsApp, having access through linked devices. So, I finally understood that even after I had warned her that I would be looking, etc., and she had said she understood, and kept mentioning that I would be nitpicking forever, she was simply playing with my feelings and trying to make me paranoid so it would be easier for her to leave.
‚ÄãI still thought that after being apart, as we had never reached that point before, she would reconsider everything and want to come back on her own. But I told her I would no longer put in effort or have hope, and that everything was now up to her.
‚ÄãSeeing that call, I realize that my paranoia was not baseless after all. I feel relieved on one hand that I won't have to keep chasing her, and it's a pity she wanted to separate so drastically, but I'm angry at her behavior, especially since she wants to do it peacefully and for us to maintain contact with relatives after so much lying.
‚ÄãWe didn't have children because of certain health reasons, but she said children were not a priority for her, and she consoled me when I was having a hard time.
‚ÄãI'm simply the type of person who gets very attached and believes in only one love and lastly after my life breakpoint after i found about health issues i started living for others more, thst muself. That's why I'm writing this in despair and asking ChatGPT to correct my text mistakes, because my English is not very good. So, please, give me some advice on how to get through this and tell me if I was very wrong in acting this way.

1o4o29o,Feeling like I should break up but it's difficult.,"So I've (M23) only been seeing this girl (F20) for a month. At first things were fine, everything except maybe the sex, which wasn't quite working. But that's not the main point here.

The problem is that I cannot trust her even a tiny bit. She has a drinking problem and every time she parties (which is very often) she gets black out drunk, and ends up in random places with random people. Today she woke up in her apartment but later realised someone had been there with her. She didn't remember a thing from the night before. Turns out two dudes had followed her home and been with her there.

Then there's all the guys trying to hook up with her. All the dudes I see on her snapchat. Makes me jealous but I haven't acted on it. 

And there's some (alot of) trauma in her past making her rather unstable and chaotic. I'm that way too, but I can still handle myself 10x better. I guess it's all subjective and individual though.

But the bottom line is that I cannot trust her at all, and it's even killing all my arousal. Idk if it's time to just break up before it turns even more complicated? 

Another hard part is how she has said she likes me so much and she has even told everyone about our relationship, putting even more pressure on me. She's making it official even though she has openly stated she wants nothing official. Honestly she's just immature.",flipflipper5,1760272902.0,2,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o4o29o/feeling_like_i_should_break_up_but_its_difficult/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o4o29o/feeling_like_i_should_break_up_but_its_difficult/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False

1o4nkxv,I feel like s*** and really bad,"To sum it up, I met her on Tinder, we had been dating for 3 months, we would go out to eat, I would stay at home, I would spend time with her, everything was going well, I had not fallen in love for a long time, she was the ideal girl, with all the qualities that I liked, sometimes there were days when she felt bad but like everyone we have good days. But the last few days I did notice that she was strange, she told me that she felt depressed and to make her feel good I sent her a bouquet of roses and even the day before we had gone out and were planning to hypothetically have a family, the next day she sent me this.

""I was thinking a lot yesterday, and I honestly felt guilty receiving the roses because I feel like I'm not reciprocating your feelings with the same intensity with which you express yours. I feel like I'm not being fair to you and that it's best to walk away. I'm not comfortable with whatever we had. I don't expect you to understand, but I do expect you to at least respect my decision.""

A few days later, I left her a message that I absolutely had to give her because I had bought it for her, and I left her a letter telling her that I still loved her and that no matter what the problems, I would be by her side. 


She left me this written text:

""You didn't have to give me so many things. You don't have to be good to me if I wasn't good to you. I'm a lousy person, and I don't deserve someone as good as you to care so much about me.

I thank you anyway. It will always be in my mind that I never deserved you. You are worth a lot and deserve a beautiful person like you... despite feeling angry and filled with so much hate, it wasn't fair of me to take it out on you. I know I acted very immaturely, and I apologize for it. I'm just a coward... I will always support you and wish the best for your life.

 I think you realized in our last conversations, but I am an unstable and broken being, someone who doesn't deserve to be happy. I couldn't contribute anything good to your life, so... if it helps, don't feel like you've lost something. On the contrary...""

I don't know what to think about her if she used me, if I should really pursue her, if I use this as an excuse because she found someone else.

1o4naxh,[first love][6y][neurodiverse] Meeting with female friends feels weird. I guess I have to relearn platonic friendships? Tipps appreciated!,"Hey all,

most is in the title. I am 33, male and am neurodiverse (autism, late-diagnosed and adhd). The relationship was with a wonderful woman that unfortunately could not live with my autistic needs, which we only discovered at the end.

As I drifted into [autistic burnout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism#Fatigue,_burnout,_inertia,_meltdown,_shutdown), I also withdraw socially, and in the end only had her and a close male friend. After the breakup (3m ago), the friend also found a job elsehwere and unfortunately had to move.

Because I know that isolation is unhealthy, I reactivate old relationship in my city, which so far works well. But I noticed that something changed regarding how I feel towards female friends: It seems that I am attracted to ALL of them when I meet them, in a romantic and physical way. At the same time, I still feel very chaotic inside and my life somehow shattered. This is really annoying, as it hinders my ability to have normal, platonic friendships with female friends.

Is this normal? Or do you have tipps?

1o4mhlc,Lying down on the beach with my ex right now. Doesn‚Äôt change the fact that I will be moving out of our shared apartment when we are back from the trip,"We booked this trip before we broke up. He ended things with me in peace just 2 weeks before this and we both decided to go for this as a nice closure. In the end, we don‚Äôt hate each other.

I don‚Äôt know how I feel. The trip has gone well so far, we are going back home tomorrow. But the thing he talked about the most during the trip is me moving out of the apartment when we are back.

He ended things because we were ‚Äútoo different‚Äù, he said. Yet he never raised those concerns with me so I could have had a chance to fix things for us.

I did cry a lot, I did tried to save the relationship. But at this point, it feels like all this is never this important to him as it is to me. 

I cried almost the whole flight to Spain, but I think I have had enough of crying.

I still feel sentimental every time I look at him, but I know I am now in a new stage. I no longer cry when I think about the memories we shared. All thanks to the way he treated me during the trip.

He wasn‚Äôt rude, wasn‚Äôt mean. He was just cold, and indifferent. I think he already checked out before we broke up.  Part of me secretly hope this trip would change his mind, but now I don‚Äôt want it anymore. 

I hope it won‚Äôt be too hard for me when we get back home.

1o4mgul,Defeated,"It‚Äôs been like 7 months since things finally ended and 4 months of NC. I still think of him everyday and cry over him every week. He meant the world to me. I think a part of me doesn‚Äôt want to move on, in hopes he suddenly pops up saying he worked on himself and he still wants me. But he made it clear he would never try with me again. I know I have to move on and I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he‚Äôs already with another girl. That‚Äôs how little I mattered. 

I don‚Äôt understand why he led me on for so long with us getting back together multiple times and promising to work on himself. Why did he lie over and over again? Why did he say I meant everything to him? Why say all these big words and not mean any of it? I want an explanation, but I know I‚Äôll never get one. 

He was good to me until he wasn‚Äôt. He worked so hard for us but one day he stopped completely and yet he said he gave it his all at the end. Did I just not matter enough in the end? That‚Äôs what I think.. because I didn‚Äôt want to give up on him even though my friends encouraged me to leave many times. He was worth it to me. It has affected me so much that I wasn‚Äôt. I‚Äôve always had trouble making friends and I don‚Äôt really have people to rely on, even though I made a ton of new friends after the breakup. He was my rock and I could call him at any time pretty much.  He would cheer me up. He didn‚Äôt really understand why I would be upset so much but now I know that this is depression. That must be why my thoughts are always sad. I don‚Äôt want these thoughts either, but it seems like I‚Äôll always be like this. It only got worse after the breakup with mini panic attacks here and there.

I have been going back and forth on reaching out. To give myself peace perhaps. To give him a piece of my mind and tell him he should have learned from this. He honestly shouldn‚Äôt be in a relationship since he only ever thinks of himself. But he will just do what he wants anyways. On the other hand, I feel I should let this hate go. He doesn‚Äôt deserve to hear from me. The last message between us was a sorry I know he doesn‚Äôt truly mean. If he ruins his relationships and himself over and over again, it‚Äôs not my job to help. He‚Äôs not a person in my life anymore. I still don‚Äôt know what would be right though.

1o4mbif,"broke up after 5 years, is it worth it trying again so soon?","so one month ago, my (26F) boyfriend (29M) broke up with me after a couple weeks of being distant (admittedly, we had some things that seemed to be uncompromisable come up e.g his newfound religious state). I immediately initiated as close to no contact as I can and essentially have been grieving on my own, but he reached out to me yesterday and asked to meet up today. We did so and spoke about basically everything that happened. He said everything I wanted to hear at the time of the break up, we spoke about everything that seemed to go wrong and talked about what he wanted to do to improve and put into place if we try it again. I know I wasn‚Äôt blameless (I have pride and control issues that led to him feeling unheard and I think I had accepted the potential for a breakup whilst still in the relationship), but I told him how apprehensive I was about the idea of picking up where we left off when the last four weeks have been so upsetting. 
What I want to know is it too soon to try again? 
Am I just entertaining the idea because I crave connection and looking at everything through rose-tinted glasses? Could he have really had that realisation in a months time? How do I cope/heal my controlling/prideful behaviour wound to let him give me what I deserve?

1o4m9pj,"i (21F) broke up with my boyfriend (20M) because he kept ignoring me when i needed him. now he‚Äôs asking if we‚Äôre really over, i don‚Äôt know what to do.","hey reddit, i really need to get this off my chest and maybe get some advice too.

two days ago, i texted my boyfriend ‚Äúwhat are you doing?‚Äù ‚Äî something normal, simple. he didn‚Äôt reply, even though he was online. after 2‚Äì3 hours, i asked him why he didn‚Äôt answer, and he said, ‚Äúit felt like you were interrogating me.‚Äù

that honestly hurt me a lot. i told him that if he really feels like i‚Äôm interrogating him over such a normal question, maybe we shouldn‚Äôt be together. i got so upset that i blocked him for a few hours just to calm down.

then, the next night, i had a really bad panic attack. i couldn‚Äôt sleep and all i wanted was to be on call with him ‚Äî not even to talk, just to feel safe hearing his voice. i called him, but he didn‚Äôt pick up. i texted saying, ‚Äúplease just pick up, you don‚Äôt even have to talk,‚Äù but he still ignored it. he even declined one of my calls.

yesterday, i waited the entire day thinking maybe he‚Äôd call me or check on me. but he didn‚Äôt. later, he texted that he was ‚Äúsleeping,‚Äù even though he was online most of the day. that completely broke me.

at night, i called him again a few times. he texted saying he‚Äôd call me back, but he never did. when i brought it up, we argued. i told him how he never tries to fix things when i‚Äôm upset, and he said he ‚Äúneeded time.‚Äù

then he started saying stuff like, ‚Äúi‚Äôm not a good boyfriend, i have flaws, i didn‚Äôt keep you happy, i‚Äôm the worst person.‚Äù i told him, ‚Äúi don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre the worst person, but you were never there when i needed you.‚Äù

so i told him to just break up with me. he refused, but still didn‚Äôt call. i finally called him and told him to block me and delete my number ‚Äî and he did.

and now, today, he texted me saying, ‚Äúare we really not together anymore?‚Äù

i love him. i really do. but i‚Äôm so tired of feeling ignored and unimportant. every time i needed him, he chose to look away. but part of me still misses him so much.

1o4m2ib,I [19F] broke up with my boyfriend[20M] but none of us wanted it,"I need advice regarding me [19F] and my boyfriend's[20M] relationship.

I need some things in a relationship like dates, flowers, little paragraphs, and gestures that show I matter. My boyfriend and I have fought about him not giving those things, but he has opened up a lot over time. He‚Äôs become more physically affectionate and verbally reassuring, but I need him to do more. I need him to be proactive and not just reactive.

He‚Äôs very career and family oriented and has to dedicate time to that, but he also loves me. He feels tired because he feels like he‚Äôs trying his best. Over the past 8 months I‚Äôve learned to give him time and I‚Äôve become better myself too. We both helped each other improve up to a certain point, but after that we just kept fighting and got exhausted.

We decided to break up three days ago, which I initiated, but we were still acting like a couple. 

Today I told him I want clarity and we kept going back and forth, saying we love each other but admitting we aren‚Äôt compatible but we both still did want to try but at the same time were exhausted. 

I think compatibility can be built, but I can‚Äôt do this anymore. He wants to date me but he feels like whatever he does isn‚Äôt enough, and I can‚Äôt keep fighting for something I consider the bare minimum. We've had similar fights 3-4 times before this and this is the first time we've broke up.

He's my person even if he didn't do much. I love him and no, I don't love a potential version of him, I love him but I wish he would show me the way he loves me in a way I could feel it.

I still want to date him because he‚Äôs improved a lot, but the pace is very slow and I can‚Äôt keep waiting for more while feeling like I‚Äôm asking too much.

We both love each other and want to date but are tired of fighting...should we get back together eventually after a month or two or should I just move on?


TL;DR: We love each other but keep fighting over emotional needs I have like dates, gestures, and feeling prioritized. He‚Äôs improved but too slowly, we broke up recently, and now I‚Äôm torn between giving space or moving on since I can‚Äôt keep waiting for him to show love in a way I feel.

I didn't beg, I didnt chase, I never texted him. But I suffered a lot and was wondering what happened. Oh god I cried so much.

But now I don't care, In fact he could text I wouldn't even answer. Because I realised that the true love of your life would NEVER abandon you, your true love would search for solution. And you know what, god put someone else in my life, with who for now I live an happy life. And I would rather die than make him suffer or break up with him, that what true love looks like.

1o4ls21,Not sure if I made the right decision,"(I'm not really sure if this is the right place to post this so let me know pls)

So I (17F) broke up with my girlfriend of a year and a half last thursday and I'm not sure if I did the right thing. Before it happened, it felt like the best option but now that she hates me and I'm more devastated than I expected, I'm not sure if it was the best move.

It was a good relationship and she was a really good girlfriend, but during summer I felt like I changed a lot mentally and found myself not wanting to spend time with her as girlfriends, and essentially falling out of love with her. I started to instinctively distance myself when school started again and we started seeing eachother more often (i hoped that that feeling would go away once I got back to the routine, but it even got worse in this aspect) and in the last week, I even hoped that her ""we should talk"" texts were for her to break up with me. I felt weird doing things of couples with her and didn't feel happy anymore.

I belive that the fact that I'm horrendous at communicating (or knowing) how I feel didn't help and when I felt that I even had to ""hide"" some things about me because of possible (but very unprobable) judgement made me distance myself and maybe ignite this feeling. Adding to that, some of our differences made things harsh too (she loves to argue and I despise it, our ideas of future have important diferences, some of our habits or ideals are very opposite, etc).

I tried to tell her in a way that wouldn't completly destroy her (in wich I think I failed) and poorly explayned why I felt like it was the best thing to do. We cried, we huged and we parted ways. We haven't talked since yesterday (except for a message that I sent apologising for waiting so many days to tell her) but a friend in common talked to her and told me that she was feeling horribly and maybe I should reconsider my decision.

At the same time that I think it was the best thing to do, I feel horribly because I feel like I dumped almost 2 years of a relationship without proper explanations. Even thought I feel like I don't see a future with us together, I feel like I should have fought harder and waited for things to be better, but I didn't wanted to drag a feeling that wasn't there anymore. This was my first ever relationship so I have no idea of what I'm doing.

So here am I, because I basically can't ask anybody else for advice. What are your opinions and what shoud I do? Wait? Talk to her? Go back to her?

1o4lqbe,should have wrote this 2 years ago,"Its been almost two years since then, and she (f27) just told me (26m) today that she's seeing someone.

We had been together for three years. We came to meet through a cc class, and the following year we met again through a dating app. We fell in love hard, and eventually moved in together. She was the first time I said 'I love you' first and the first time I went out of my way to write notes, get flowers, make trips or any fun events. She made me try, because I wanted to show it how she made me feel. 

As time went on I started to become complacent. I didnt push hard when she'd ask to go out, or work out, or much anything. I ended up ruining a trip with a mutual because of my porn problem, and it felt like I kept letting it slip away after that. By the last two month of our relationship, we were becoming more distant and less communicative. She ended it two years ago this month, and I feel like a ran away so fast. 

We were still in touch, not as much, and we eventually had a fling I guess for a few months after. There were things that happened that i wasnt there for that i could have helped with that i havent forgiven myself. I havent forgiven myself for most of my inaction during the relationship. We kept trying to find a way forward but it didnt work out to the point she said 'we can be lovers or friends but we cant be together'. I chose friendship, and we started doing our own thing more. I remember much later that last year she mentioned a situation that was part of a larger drama in her life and it killed me. I tried to focus on myself more, reading, exercising, restyling, etc. 

I met other people, had short rekindlings and hookups and dating but I could never get her out of my mind. To me there's always a false hope that there's a future for us. We talked openly about wanting to get married and have kids eventually. I always hoped that there was still some part of her that wanted to try again, try for something new. She still loves me, shes told me, but in a different way. I was her first long time relationship and love, and I always hold a place in her heart. But it is a different love. 

She's the best person I've ever met and no one has come close. I fumbled so hard it'll be felt forever. Im still obsessed with her and think about her every day. Every song is still about her, everything I see makes me think of her. Ive moved half the country away to clear head and its done the opposite. I feel like I've just run away again. We've moved on in other ways, but I would still give my whole life just for hers to be happy. But she doesn't need that, she needs me to leave her alone. I can do that too. 

Been trying to write, play music, and read again to heal some more, but I dont know how ill ever be OK being with someone else. I see myself as never married, never childborn, nothing. My world feels like its constantly closing in for many reasons, but this chokes me. I miss her, or I guess the memory of her. 

I dont know what to do from here.

1o4lcp5,He said he doesn't like what he's becoming... and I think that's why we fell apart.. how could have i done this better?,"On a fight, he [27M] told me [23F] he wasn't feeling good in the relationship. After I pushed a little, he said, ""I don't like what I'm becoming.""

He's genuinely one of the nicest guys I've ever known, calm, logical, and mature in ways that still surprise me. He doesn't talk much, but when he does, there's always sharp logic that just cuts through all the emotional noise. He never rants or overthinks like I do. If something upsets him, he just says, ""Learnt my lesson, I'll take care next time."" No self-blame, no drama.

But when I rant, he listens patiently. Then once I'm done spiraling, he somehow sums everything up with a grounded solution. That's it. No dragging things on.

Recently, we broke up. Or maybe it's a ""break."" I don't even know anymore. I just... don't want to accept it yet. There's still this small part of me hoping he'll come back once I've figured my own shit out.

I know I've been a little too harsh, defensive, and emotional lately, maybe too much for him to handle. But I haven't asked for closure, because I'm scared that doing so would mean closing the last bit of hope left.

He once said he's started ranting, gossiping, craving drama, things he hated about other people. And that's what really stuck with me. Maybe he felt like being with me was pulling him into a version of himself he didn't

Now I keep wondering... is there something I could fix? Or was it never really about me, just about how he felt with himself?

TL/DR: My (23F) boyfriend (27M) said he doesn't like what he's becoming in our relationship, that he's turning into someone who rants, gossips, and enjoys drama, which isn't him.

1o4kk8r,I just got dumped,So yeah I lost the only person I ever loved. We might not have been together for the longest time (especially compared to the people that lost someone after marriage) but I was really sure we are going to stay together long-term. They were such a great person to be around and talk to. They always made me laugh and I really loved to just stay in their presence. Before we got together we were friends and I was really grateful that someone like that wants to spend any time with me. So yeah I was overjoyed when the relationship evolved. Both of us come from w similar childhoods and we both had it really hard. I always felt that we could depend on each other and worked for the benefit of us both. I just felt that we get each other and are a part of something great. Now I feel like someone ripped my guts out. They said they needed to call me and we talked for some time. Somewhere in the conversation they said that the relationship is hurting us both to which I replied that I don't feel that I am hurt by it. So I asked if they do and they said yes. Also they had some mental health issues and were previously on meds but they didn't really help. But yeah they said they were hurt and said that they want to break up and also added that if they call me again wanting to make up that i should reject them. I just don't understand where did it come from. I know we had some problems like all people do our pasts certainly didn't help with that. But 2 days before they literally thanked me for always helping them and for being kind and said that they love me and will make sure I know that as much as possible. Now why would anyone say words like that just to brake up moment later. Just who does shit like this. They were really someone I feel at home with. Like someone who is just there for you when you need it. Your best friend and also partner. And now I am all alone. I feel like vomiting constantly and I somehow have to go back to living my life. I am so tired and I just wish none of it was real. Also it sucks that I just can't hate them now. I still love the same person I did but Its over now and I have to live with it.,NorthLetterhead8161,1760260850.0,2,1.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o4kk8r/i_just_got_dumped/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o4kk8r/i_just_got_dumped/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o4kjrs,I would‚Äôve handled them breaking up SO MUCH BETTER if they‚Äôd just done it in a grown up and humane manner‚Ä¶,"The BU was down to some of my own self sabotaging behaviour, although she did have some very controlling/ possessive/ paranoid tendencies before I even started sabotaging. The way she broke up was horrific. I paid for us to go on holiday for a week in August, we had a lovely time until the last day when she was so cold and off with me. After she said she‚Äôd just been ‚Äúreally tired‚Äù‚Ä¶ She planned a really cute 1 year anniversary surprise date for me 2 weeks after, the a week later I visited her after work, took her flowers, we had a lovely night and a really romantic bath, all the usual ‚ÄúI love yous‚Äù etc. 

A week later she brought up something she was upset about and wanted to ‚Äútalk‚Äù, the text was really understanding and fair. The next day I said morning and she phoned at 6am an hour before I had to leave for work, screaming in a huge out of control rage, saying she‚Äôs on the verge of dumping me. I went into fight/ flight/ freeze, it was so overwhelming, she finally blew up and said ‚Äúit‚Äôs fucking over, we‚Äôre done‚Äù. I was so upset by that point, I put the phone down, went to work and had the worst day I‚Äôve ever had. She phoned at work twice, I was busy but also just scared she‚Äôd be screaming at me again. I think she‚Äôd already made her mind up, it was like she‚Äôd wanted to get it over with as soon as possible with no regard for the fact I actually needed to go to work after that. If I‚Äôd ever wanted to split up with her I‚Äôd have never done it before she had work. She‚Äôd done that before, pick arguments with me on my way to work or at work, however she stopped doing it after 2 occasions when I finally had enough.

The next day I was a complete state, anxious attachment spiralling, texting her asking to talk. She phoned me, I was very much in damage control mode I guess telling her I needed her and loved her, apologising, also told her I thought I was depressed due to other things like family issues and being burned out from work (She was well aware of these things) and we made up, decided to go to couple‚Äôs therapy as I‚Äôd said I wanted to go back to therapy myself anyway. She went back to normal with the usual ‚Äúnight night xx‚Äù message, texting as normal the next day too.

2 days later she asked to talk, something felt off to me. She phoned and dumped me all over again. Saying she still loves me but has been so anxious lately, after she dumped me the first time she felt better then felt really anxious again after we‚Äôd made up. Saying I care about you so much, I‚Äôm open to reconciling in the future if you get some help for yourself etc. She said while we‚Äôd been on holiday her nervous system had been a wreck, and after we got back she was crying every day. I was so taken aback I didn‚Äôt ask why she‚Äôd hid this stuff from me, or planned that anniversary date as if we were in a good place with each other. NC after that.

Just under 1 day short of 3 weeks NC she phoned me late at night I missed the call and rang back no answer, then text her asking if she was ok, and she responds 10 mins later saying ‚Äúsorry that was an accident‚Äù. I sent her an apology via voice note and she completely ignored it. 

In hindsight she seemed anxious attachment during our relationship but during the breakup and lead up to it she went completely avoidant instead. But even just ‚Äòavoidant‚Äô seems a bit of an oversimplification, at this point I‚Äôm wondering if she has some kind of personality disorder. I wonder if the humane things like making up the first time she dumped me, she did on purpose to upset me more when she re-dumped me, that her being kind on the phone the 2nd time was a manipulation tactic to screw me up more when she‚Äôd breadcrumb me 3 weeks later. I feel like it was all manipulation, the checking out weeks before but going on holiday, planning cute dates, having sex with me, saying I love you etc, while clearly preparing to break up, it was all just a power play.

I feel like I never got the real version of her, she‚Äôs like a different person. She told me about her abusive ex husband that she divorced 2 years before we met, I‚Äôm wondering if all the marriage breakdown was actually just down to her. She also told me she had some situationship fwb thing 6 months after the divorce and he ghosted her after 6 months. Tbh I wonder if he just saw all the red flags that I gave her the benefit of the doubt on and ran a mile‚Ä¶ 

I‚Äôm trying to be open to the fact she didn‚Äôt shut me out and lie about all this and handle the breakup so badly on purpose, but it all just seems so calculated. I always find myself coming back to wondering if she just used me for a free holiday.",punk_quarterbackpunk,1760260800.0,6,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o4kjrs/i_wouldve_handled_them_breaking_up_so_much_better/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o4kjrs/i_wouldve_handled_them_breaking_up_so_much_better/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o4kdsm,Is there any chance of me getting my ex back that I miss like crazy?,"Me (26m) ex (28f), my bad communication habits was the reason she ended things with us because she got fed up which is fair enough, we used to argue a couple times a month and I would just shut down get in a mood and go on the defensive.

She went on holiday with her sister and we had an argument on the first day but sorted it quickly after she said we need to meet when she's back so we can talk about things and how we can make it work and find techniques for my communication so I don't shut down, so that time she was away I took the time to look into things to help with my communication also got myself into therapy, then the first day back from her she holiday she decided to end things which left me really confused and lost, she gave me proper kisses on the lips said she loves and will miss me like crazy as we were saying goodbye so now I'm even more confused.

The relationship and connection was really good it all just came down to my communication and I wanna make things right I just don't know how to go about it, we haven't spoken for 15 days now but she said she would eventually message me.

1o4kcpt,ruined things with my ex after a breakup how do i move on,"
I don‚Äôt really know where to start, but I need to let this out because I‚Äôve been carrying so much guilt.

My ex (let‚Äôs call him Willy) and I dated for about a year. He was my second boyfriend, but my first real love. I truly loved him deeply ‚Äî he was patient, romantic, and kind. But during our relationship, I started to lose myself. I became dependent, anxious, and terrified of losing him. He broke up with me in August, saying his grades were falling and he needed to focus on school. He also admitted he wasn‚Äôt sure about us anymore.

After the breakup, I kept hoping he‚Äôd come back. We‚Äôd text or call once in a while, and every time we did, it felt like reopening an old wound. He told me he still missed me, that he cried over our photos, that no one compared ‚Äî but he also said he couldn‚Äôt get back together.

About a week after we broke up, we had to work a part-time job together. It was horrible for me. I remember begging him to come back, asking if we could try again, but he just kept saying no. He told me he didn‚Äôt want to get back together and that his mind was made up. I cried so much that week. It felt like he had already emotionally moved on, and I was still stuck where he left me.

Then, about two to three weeks later, we worked another part-time job together again. At first, we didn‚Äôt talk at all ‚Äî the silence was heavy and awkward. Then, slowly, we started having small conversations again. He told me things like:

‚ÄúIf we get back, only my parents will know.‚Äù
‚ÄúI still think about you.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe could‚Äôve taken a break instead.‚Äù
‚ÄúI still haven‚Äôt thrown our pictures away.‚Äù

Hearing those words confused me so much. It made me feel like maybe there was still a chance ‚Äî like he still cared, even if he didn‚Äôt want to admit it.

After those shifts, we started hanging out again. We met twice ‚Äî once to watch a movie, and the second time just to chill. On that second hangout, we ended up making out. While we were kissing, he said, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get back together.‚Äù I remember feeling so happy, like maybe things were finally going to be okay again. That was on September 2nd.

But the very next day, on September 3rd, he texted me saying he couldn‚Äôt do this. That he was confused with himself. That he didn‚Äôt know what he wanted anymore.

It broke me all over again. I thought things were finally changing, but it was like being left a second time.

After that, I found out he had been talking to some girls since our breakup. One of them was a girl named Ally, someone he met from a dating app. He told me he didn‚Äôt like her at all ‚Äî that she was just someone he talked to casually. But later, Ally told me the truth: they actually texted and video-called quite a lot, and that he was kind of flirting with her. After I found out and texted Ally myself, he got angry at me, and they stopped talking after that.

Not long after, there was another girl ‚Äî Isis, a Thai girl he met during a trip with his friend. She had asked for his Instagram, and they started talking too. When I found out, it broke me again. He swore he wasn‚Äôt interested, but deep down, I knew it wasn‚Äôt true. It hurt even more because he used to tell me he didn‚Äôt want anyone else ‚Äî that he was ‚Äúdone with relationships for now.‚Äù But his actions said otherwise.

After the breakup, I made another big mistake. Out of desperation and confusion, I texted his first ex and some of his friends ‚Äî asking what happened, why he broke up with me, and what I did wrong. I even asked his ex if it was normal for him to just lose feelings like that. I know it was wrong and I shouldn‚Äôt have involved them, but I was desperate. I just wanted answers. He was my first love, and I didn‚Äôt know how to handle that kind of pain.

Then I texted Ally ‚Äî the girl from the dating app ‚Äî trying to get some kind of closure, and she told him. He got furious and called me, saying I keep ‚Äúruining his life,‚Äù that I‚Äôm selfish, and that he hates me now. He told me I think I‚Äôm doing something good, but I‚Äôm not. Hearing that broke me.

The truth is, I knew messaging her was wrong. But I did it because I wanted him to hate me ‚Äî so that I could finally stop hoping. I wanted closure so badly that I ended up self-sabotaging everything. I just didn‚Äôt want to keep holding on anymore.

After that whole situation, I texted him once asking if he wanted his school jacket back. I deleted the message soon after, but the next night, around 10PM, he called me. He said he wanted to check how I was doing. He told me he‚Äôs been staying home most of the time, only going out with his parents, and that he‚Äôd stopped talking to Isis ‚Äî the Thailand girl ‚Äî because she didn‚Äôt reply fast anymore. He also said he stopped learning Thai.

And just recently, I called him again and asked if he wanted to meet up. He said no ‚Äî but then he asked if I wanted to do some volunteer work together, because it‚Äôs a compulsory activity for his school. I honestly don‚Äôt know what to do. Part of me still wants to see him, but another part of me knows it‚Äôll only make things worse.

Now I just feel‚Ä¶ empty. I know it‚Äôs really over this time, and I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôll ever reach out again. I can‚Äôt stop blaming myself. I ruined everything with someone I genuinely loved. I keep thinking I‚Äôll never have anything good again ‚Äî that maybe I destroy everything I touch.

I don‚Äôt know why I keep wanting to contact him even when I know he doesn‚Äôt want me anymore. It‚Äôs like a habit I can‚Äôt break ‚Äî like I‚Äôm addicted to the little hope that maybe one day he‚Äôll come back. But deep down, I know he won‚Äôt. And I know I need to stop. I just don‚Äôt know how.

How do I stop checking his profile, stop thinking about him, stop wanting to hear his voice again? I want to move on, but my heart keeps dragging me back to someone who has already let go of me.

1o4k5g7,Feedback on response to ex,"This is a long one, so thanks for anyone willing to read this.

How do we feel about my response to this message? It‚Äôs been two weeks since he sent the original message and I haven‚Äôt said anything yet. He has avoidant tendencies due to a major trauma in childhood, so I want to give him the chance to make the decision to put in more effort before I fully let go. 

Please refrain from telling me to get over it and move on as that is already what I plan to do if he refuses to meet my needs or have a conversation. Believe me when I say I know the way he operates and whether he‚Äôs really done or not. 

I want to convey that I‚Äôm open to a discussion, but firm in my boundaries and needs. (A lot of the reasons he gives in his message for the break-up are in my opinion generic avoidant excuses just fyi, not referring to his stress, depression, or lack of time/energy, but mostly the compatibility issues he mentions). 

Message from ex:

Hey [Curious Cat], I‚Äôm so sorry you feel disrespected. I know I might be coming across as callous, but I think we‚Äôre both coming to the same problem. It‚Äôs not going to be solved by talking or compromise. We‚Äôre living at different speeds and in different circumstances, and I don‚Äôt have the time or energy to give you what you need. It‚Äôs frustrating for both of us, and I don‚Äôt think we know each other as much as you think we do. We don‚Äôt seem to have much in common and i suppose that i something i value, and it‚Äôs hard for us to connect in person or over text. I guess I don‚Äôt think a relationship is as important to me as I thought because I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm in a position to do so. Putting time and resources into one just doesn‚Äôt seem to work with my goals right now.

I like you, [curious cat], but I don‚Äôt have time to work things out at least until I get out of [state ex lives in], or I at least can‚Äôt honestly plan for doing so. I know this is going to come across as even more callous and heartless for trying to be succinct, but that‚Äôs all I can give you right now because I‚Äôm barely holding on too and can‚Äôt have arguments like this at a speed that you are comfortable at that wont just keep compounding over time. 

I should have said that we should have gone with your idea of not talking until you are back from your trip earlier, but i cant communicate fast enough and thats not going to change anytime to soon if im being honest. Id be open to trying to talk again once things calm down or you are back from your trip, but right now i just feel too stretched out and have to draw a line somewhere. 

I am trying to figure out how the hell to actually make things work and learn about myself and not be depressed and be happy and it is very very hard to do so and i cant do it for both of us and sometimes that what it feels like I am, and maybe thats a me problem but I am not going to fix it at this rate if i am already struggling this much‚Äù


My response:

‚ÄúHi [Ex‚Äôs Name],

I appreciate your honesty. I would be open to having a conversation sometime this month to explore how we might work through this together if you feel up to it because I care about you and what we have. 

I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre feeling stretched thin and overwhelmed. I don‚Äôt want to be adding to that. I can certainly empathize with being depressed and overwhelmed. I understand your concerns about closeness and your limited time and energy right now. I don‚Äôt want either of us to feel responsible for the other‚Äôs happiness. My hope is for us to support each other through difficult times because I believe connection can be a lifeline in those moments. 

I do have some boundaries and nonnegotiable needs: clear commitment and respectful effective communication. If we can agree on those standards, I‚Äôd be happy to discuss options that can meet both your needs and mine while respecting our boundaries. 

I‚Äôm here when you‚Äôre ready. Either way, I‚Äôm always rooting for you and wish the best for both you and [ex‚Äôs cat‚Äôs name].‚Äù

I‚Äôll admit I did use some AI to help me write my response because I was having a hard time putting my feelings into words that conveyed compassion while maintaining self-respect.

So what‚Äôs the verdict: send or do I need to make some edits? ",Curious_Cat_22,1760259250.0,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o4k5g7/feedback_on_response_to_ex/,/r/BreakUps/comments/1o4k5g7/feedback_on_response_to_ex/,BreakUps,True,False,False,False,False,,False

1o4jml7,I don‚Äôt know how to get over her advise please,So my ex broke up with me a month ago now. The day when she broke up with me I just got back from a 12 hour work day and everything seemed normal. She was watching her show and I came to lay down due to being tired. So I tried having a conversation with her and she just is blowing off the questions with vague responses. Then when her show is down she still has her back to me and asks ‚Äúdo you believe everything is right between us‚Äù and I say what I think is yes everything is. Fucking wrong answer ig man. I ask her what‚Äôs wrong and then she goes on to list the things she has been thinking of in a soft way so I ask for it straight up no beating the bush and shit. She says ‚Äúyou need to grow up‚Äù and so we go from there I won‚Äôt bore you with the crying and shit so I decided to leave and as I am about to she asks for one last kiss. And I don‚Äôt know what it was but that broke me and now I have those times where I think I‚Äôm doing good and I‚Äôm moving on. Then I do something we would do or I smell a scent that reminds me of her and I spiral down the rabbit hole.

1o4jld0,Idk why she left,"Two months after my breakup I met her, I had gone through a breakup. Then suddenly, she came into my life , we used to have eye contact sometimes ,she somehow got my number and told me that she liked me. The same day she asked for my answer but I told her ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs take it slow, it‚Äôll take me some time But she was in a hurry and started treating me like her boyfriend right away , After some time, she asked for my answer again and that time I said yes. Everything was going fine, but I had already told her that I had been with three non physical relationship before . She didn‚Äôt tell me anything about her past then , Two or three weeks later during our relationship, she told me she also had an ex who didn‚Äôt respect her and all that , After that she started doubting me all the time. No matter what I did , I was either at college or at job  , but if I replied late or answered her calls late ,  she would get suspicious  and because of her doubts we used to fight a lot She wanted to talk every night on calls not on text , but I couldn‚Äôt always do that because my family would find out. Still, I used to go to the terrace every night just to talk to her. But slowly, her doubts kept increasing , Just 10 days after our relationship started, she asked me for my WhatsApp password. I refused and told her that she should at least have some trust in me. I only said no because I couldn‚Äôt believe how someone  I like could doubt me so much  it hurt that she didn‚Äôt trust me at all She said  that she didn‚Äôt trust me when I asked her but I told her that without trust, nothing can work. At that time, our fights weren‚Äôt that serious. But later  she brought up that same topic again. I even told her, ‚ÄúTake my WhatsApp, Instagram ‚Äî check everything, there‚Äôs no other girl, but still she didn‚Äôt believe me. Then one time, I fell sick for 2‚Äì3 days and couldn‚Äôt go to work, and I didn‚Äôt message her first because I was waking up too late and not feeling well too . She thought I was talking to some other girl. Even though I told her I was sick, she didn‚Äôt believe me and ended up blocking me , When I tried to convince her , she came back but the next day, she blocked me again. Then I tried calling her both numbers and then I called her friend and told her that she blocked me and all pls tell her to call me  then after 1 hr she called me from her friend‚Äôs phone and said that I wasn‚Äôt her type, that we were very different and I don't have time for her , and we couldn‚Äôt be together. She said whenever she prayed to God ,  God used to tell her, ‚ÄúIf you didn‚Äôt get the one you loved before her (  ex  )  then don‚Äôt love anyone else  ( me ) what you‚Äôre doing now is wrong  , And that‚Äôs how she broke up with me. During the relationship, I‚Äôll admit that sometimes I treated her a bit poorly because of work stress or ego  like replying late or not replying at all. But still, I don‚Äôt understand why she broke up with me like that , she unblocked me after breakup from everywhere I tried talking to her again literally begged her to comeback but Don‚Äôt message me, or I‚Äôll tell my  family that you‚Äôre bothering me. (She lives in a hostel, far from home )  At first I wasn't interested in her but when I fell deeply in love with her she left , I still think about her and I can‚Äôt get over her memories. I‚Äôve never missed any of my exes as much as I miss her. How to get over her ?

1o4jlch,He dumped me and treated me awfully,"Good morning.
I am writing to tell you about my experience and to read your comments, whether encouraging or not. After all, any problem a person has, he goes through alone, even if he has the support of friends, relatives, etc.
I had a relationship for a year with a man of my age. We have been family friends for years without ever having any romantic interest until last year, after years, we fell in love. The relationship started from a distance, but we realized from the beginning that if we wanted to end it, I would have to take the step and go to the city where he lived. This was not an obstacle, as I had also been thinking about leaving my city for years.

Everything was great, we fell in love, something I hadn't felt in many years, I was calm, happy and our needs and our phase were the same. Over time and while I went to his city for the Christmas holidays, we decided to actively look for professional opportunities in his city. Indeed, something was found that I could start since I didn't have a social circle there. I told him to be sure of his decision, for me it would be a life decision in the sense that I wouldn't follow a simple guy but a person I want to invest emotionally and become truly attached to. I am 40 years old. He told me that it was the same for him.

Thank God when I went to quit my job, they suggested me a change of contract and work remote. I felt that everything was favorable and that my life showed that my decision was right. I went with many dreams that from the fourth day of our common life began to crush as from the fourth day he asked me to leave from the house during a fight.
I stayed there for 6 months because he was involved in tourism and stayed in a hotel elsewhere, which I knew from the beginning but I was fine with it. The relationship was a priority and so I went even if I knew that in the summer I would be alone. I was trying to find things to do on my own since I am out of nature independent. There were quarrels in the first two weeks as the change of me influenced me very negative but then I told myself to learn to manage it. But I tried a lot against me when I went I had a human being who wanted tranquility but was negatively prejudiced with our relationship, he said that I was initiating fights and he could not provide me with security, he was no longer in love with me at all. He believed that the relationships do not want effort, he told me several times to leave the house even though I had given money to buy some furniture and called me manipulative because I was‚Äôt leaving and that I was too sensitive. He used to say that it was not a big step that I did in our 40s it is easier to let go of them all when you are younger because you are more aware when you grow up and risk.

A month ago my period was delayed, he was terrified, I discussed it with him, I told him that I would hardly stay pregnant and that what is prioritized is for us to fund a way and get along. From the 6 months I was there we stayed together only one month. I was waiting for the season to come to an end and for him come to our house and stay together. After we discussed it the next day that he again asked me if I had my period, I said ""yes you have lost 10 years from your life"", he replied ""20 years"". It was there that I felt bad for me, a year together, I left it all for him and for us and he just thinking about it he got sick. I was so sad, I told him to break up if he feels like that. I didn‚Äôt want to break up but to find a way and get along. He told me to break up, that he didn't react when I talked to him about breaking up and that I was manipulating him because I was badly psychologically and told him that his excessive reaction hurt me. He did not accept that I was offended. We talked calmly on the phone at night and said to go for sleep. The next day, I sent him a message, I called him but he didn't answer, until afternoon he sent me a message that he thought, he took time and for the good of his mental health to leave the house, not to call him  and good luck ...

It's been a month, he sent me my belonging so fast, I am in a state that I feel a huge emptiness in me. Maybe I'm still in shock as I look around and how much my life changed. I feel good with myself because from the beginning I did the best to sleep in the evening with my consciousness clean.

1o4jcbl,Any tips to move on faster and stop wanting to text her?,"It's been a week, there has been a lot of back and forth but overall I don't think it has gotten better. 
I'm fighting like hell not to text her. I haven't texted her but I don't think I've known anything harder in my privileged little life.
I'm spending a lot of time with the people I love and it's helping but it's her I wanna spend time with. 
What can I do to stop being so dependent ln her and accept that it's for the best? When did it start to get just a little better for you?
I can't sleep, every night is hell. I want my life back.

1o4ijs3,"think I was in a relationship with a narcissist, but I can‚Äôt stop feeling anxious and lost. How do I move on?","
Hi everyone,

I (F40) left my partner (M38) after a 15‚Äëyear relationship. We met online, and at first he was incredibly charming ‚Äî full of praise, attention, and affection. He acted like a true gentleman, and I thought I‚Äôd finally found my person.

But over time, things started to feel off. I found out he had slept over at a girl‚Äôs house ‚Äî in her bed ‚Äî without telling me. He said nothing sexual happened and that he slept in his boxers, but the fact that they shared the same bed without my knowledge hurt me deeply. He said he didn‚Äôt tell me because he knew I‚Äôd be upset. That explanation made me feel like I was going crazy ‚Äî like I was overreacting ‚Äî even though anyone in a relationship would be hurt by that.

Later, I discovered he had befriended another girl he met on a bus and was seeing her without telling me. He always insisted these women were ‚Äújust friends.‚Äù One of them, who was actually in a relationship with one of his friends, made a strange comment when I met her for the first time. She said something like, ‚ÄúWeird seeing you without your harem; I thought you liked bigger boobs than hers.‚Äù At the time, I thought she was just being rude, but now I wonder if she was trying to tell me something about what was really going on.

My anxiety got worse, and eventually, I found pictures of naked women ‚Äî friends and exes ‚Äî on his computer, along with comments he‚Äôd left on a woman‚Äôs nude photos online thanking her for ‚Äúthe pics of her nice boobs.‚Äù It made me feel sick and ashamed.

Not long after, I developed burnout from work and was put on medication that made me emotionally flat and affected my sex drive. He quickly lost patience and became angry about the lack of intimacy. He started taking his phone to the bathroom to masturbate and eventually stopped sleeping next to me. I developed vaginismus ‚Äî my body would literally freeze when he tried to have sex. It was humiliating and painful, and instead of being kind, he distanced himself even more. Our relationship turned into more of a friendship out of habit.

I always forgave him and stayed because I loved him and believed I was the problem. Even when I was hurt or anxious, I would convince myself that I was overreacting or that I needed to change, hoping our relationship would improve.

He also had strange control issues around meals. When I cooked, he insisted on eating at a very specific time. If dinner was ready a bit earlier than he expected, he would say it was too early and make me wait for him to come down. I cooked fresh meals every day, but he almost never thanked me or said he liked it. When I asked if it was good, he might say something polite, like ‚Äúyes, I like this,‚Äù but often he would just nod.

Other control issues included how he lived with his mom ‚Äî he would take ages to come to dinner and sit in the bathroom while she waited with cold food. When we lived together, he did the same to me. If I called him upstairs for dinner, he‚Äôd say yelling made him ‚Äúanxious‚Äù and that I should come up instead. When we went out, he would direct me ‚Äî telling me how to entertain people, where to walk, what to say.

He could also be incredibly moody. Some mornings he‚Äôd wake up already in a bad mood, and I‚Äôd immediately know it was going to be a day filled with tension or conflict. I felt like I was constantly walking on eggshells, trying not to say or do the wrong thing.

He had a way of twisting reality that left me doubting myself. He would sometimes tell me I said or did something that I knew for a fact never happened, but he‚Äôd insist on it until I started to question my own memory. During arguments, he always had the upper hand ‚Äî he‚Äôd talk over me, wear me down, and make me feel like I was losing my mind. I learned it was easier to give in just to stop the endless back‚Äëand‚Äëforth.

There was also a lot of monitoring and control through technology. He had a camera in the living room ‚Äúto watch the dog,‚Äù and a doorbell camera that sent notifications whenever someone passed by. When he was at work, he would still know exactly when I walked the dog, and on a few occasions he commented about me going out ‚Äútoo late,‚Äù even though the dog simply wasn‚Äôt ready earlier. I realized later he also tracked what websites I visited and even what guests did on our Wi‚ÄëFi. It made me feel like there was no privacy at all.

More recently, after leaving, I found out he once video‚Äëcalled a friend‚Äôs wife while he was in the shower. Even if it was ‚Äújust a call,‚Äù it feels incredibly inappropriate. I stopped looking for evidence of what he did online a long time ago because I couldn‚Äôt handle the stress anymore. I don‚Äôt know if he ever physically cheated toward the end ‚Äî we lived together, so I think it was more of an online thing by then. I‚Äôd usually go to bed around midnight, and he‚Äôd stay up until 4 or 5 in the morning gaming and doing who‚Äëknows‚Äëwhat on his computer.

He was charming and outgoing, and people often saw his good side. Some friends even thought he treated me like I was on a pedestal ‚Äî that he ‚Äúcarried me on both hands.‚Äù But after our breakup, several told me they had always noticed how I barely got to speak because he interrupted or talked over me. A few mutual friends have since distanced themselves from him after realizing they had similar experiences.

We had a show dog that got a lot of attention because he looked unique. My ex loved that ‚Äî maybe a little too much. He would happily stand for ages talking to strangers about the dog, soaking up the admiration, while I waited until he finally decided he was done. It made simple outings exhausting.

He was supportive financially and bought me expensive gifts, but he always forgot Valentine‚Äôs Day even though I never forgot his. He could be kind at times ‚Äî he‚Äôd take me to events I liked and sometimes tried to make me happy ‚Äî but there was always a sense that everything had to fit his rhythm, his mood, and his world. Even at work, he was known for being controlling ‚Äî he wouldn‚Äôt eat with his colleagues if they brought food with strong smells, preferring to sit alone.

Now I‚Äôve left and moved back to my home country. I miss my old environment, my home, and the people there. I feel homesick and anxious, and I‚Äôve been isolating myself because I‚Äôm scared to make decisions or move forward. I keep thinking maybe I did something to make him that way ‚Äî maybe it‚Äôs my fault. He had a rough childhood with neglect and constant fighting between his parents, and part of me feels sorry for him, like that might explain why he is like that.

Still, I can‚Äôt shake the anxiety and sadness. I just want to know how to get my life back on track, how to stop blaming myself, and how to move forward after all of this.

Has anyone else experienced something similar? How did you cope with the confusion and fear afterward? Any advice or stories would really help.

TL;DR: I left a 15‚Äëyear relationship that I think was with a narcissist. He was charming but controlling, gaslit me, monitored me with cameras, and probably flirted or crossed lines online. I always forgave him and stayed because I loved him and thought I was the problem. I don‚Äôt miss him, but I miss the life and home I built. I feel anxious, stuck, and scared to move forward.
