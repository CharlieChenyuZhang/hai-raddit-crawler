      "selftext": "On new years eve I got kicked out of my ex girlfriends house and lost the only person I actually cared about that I was with for 7 years, after dealing with depression for a few years I decided to take an overdose sometime in January. I took 60 paracetamol and to this day I don't regret it, I really wanted to die and still do... during that time I would say I was at my worst.\n\nI legit have no friends and the only person I wanted to talk to wasn't even interested, I suppose it was my own fault for relying on her so much even though I knew she was talking to someone online behind my back when my mum was in hospital and at the time we was unsure if my mum would even get out, not to mention during that time my ex was sending me nudes while I was at work which wasn't very common. After discovering she had been talking to someone online it really fucked with my head... I became a jealous freak going through her phone and was always paranoid which I hated because I didn't want the relationship to be like that.\n\nRegardless I knew she was full of shit saying things like \"I only spoke to him for 2 days\" which I would have believed if their conversations weren't so romantic, plus she told me she spoke to his mum which again just really fucked with me... anyway after the break up and getting out of hospital I realised she had unblocked him on social media and it just shattered my heart.\n\nIt's been 10 months now and I hate the fact I can barely do anything without thinking of her, I even have dreams/nightmares about her which really annoy me when I wake up I'll never forget one of last things she told me which was \"You've got nothing to be depressed about\" that's when I realised she had no idea what it's like to have mental health issues. \n\nSo during this year I've been put on medication, talked to mental health specialists and I'm on a waiting list for therapy and to be honest nothing is helping! I have no job, no friends, no goal and no motivation I just feel like a waste of space. I honestly believe life would be easier if I was dead and didn't exist, I don't want pain even though I most likely deserve it. I just want to fade away from life... I guess it doesn't help that I'm not on any social media as I seriously despise it although I can feel disconnected from the world. Anyway I've thought about drowning or hanging myself most of the year as that seems the most peaceful way out, just sinking in to the abyss of darkness, hopefully I'll get the courage to go through it with because I don't think I can last much longer, just distracting myself watching crap on YouTube and playing games for escapism which I'm starting to lose interest in... to be honest I'm not sure why I'm even writing this, it kinda makes me think I'm probably a narcissist.",

I'm an ugly person that no one wants. \n\nI'm fat, why can't I shave the extra pounds. Portion control, counting calories, exercise. I just can't do it.\n\nI'm a fucking failure at life, I work a deadend job and have a non existent support network. Abandoned by my father at birth abandoned by my mother at 18 when her job was done. She even told me I was never god enough and would vent her own trauma on me. Well fuck you.\n\nI have no fucking skills, nothing I'm proud to say I'm good at, nothing interesting to say other than the fucked up shit that's happened to me. People perk up and say OMG that terrible if I tell them about my best friend who I'd at 14, but that's it, do you guys get off on these stories?? I fucking miss you, it's not been the same.\n\nI'm fucking tired, and fucking lonely and to much of a chicken shit to take the next step either way. \n\nI ask people how they are doing and actually get ignored, they were doing a mental awareness thing at work literally last week about connecting and checking in with people and I get fucking ignored. These are people I see everyday, I'm not some fucking stranger.\n\nI feel like I'm just going through the motions, I'm stagnant, floating through life down the fucking drain. Ill say I'm done but I can't get off this ride. \n\nOkay, I need to pull myself together, thanks for reading",

      "selftext": "\n\nMy life is just stagnating with how lonely I am, and there is nothing else I can do to change it. I really am going to die alone at this point. I've been in the same place for a year now, and I'm 21 years old. I have no friends at all, and my family members are distant with me, I'm always alone. Most people my age have had or currently have a girlfriend or boyfriend, but I've never even had girlfriend before. And they have friend groups doing a lot of things together when I haven’t had a friend in a very long time.\n\nI tried making online friends, but they didn't last. I try hard to make connections with people, but It just never happens. I'm don’t understand how people build them so easily while it takes a lot for me to make them. I thought i can try focussing on my interests to drown out my loneliness, but it didn't help. There is only so much you can take doing things alone before it starts to become not enjoyable anymore. I don't really know what I want out of life, and what I do want isn't possible due to this brain I have. I'm not sure what I'm even striving for anymore.\n\nI am not like everyone else, no matter how hard I try. All I do is basic things that I struggle with, like work and school, and then I go home to my walls check my phone to see if I have at least 1 notification but nothing. I have literally no life and nothing going on I feel envious when I see people together and all I have is just myself. I'm really just a lonely, depressed loser who can't take the thought of being this way till eventually I die, at this point, suicide doesn’t seem bad than living years being autistic and this alone.",

Life is just a bunch of cruelly constructed tests designed to wither you down until your reflection physically repulses you. People always say ‘oh it’ll get better with time… time heals’. Yeah right, how bout you go fuck yourself. Time only stings and aches and strips away any sense of connection and oneness you once felt. I used to dread my dad’s death as he’s the only person i felt could truly understand me but with age he’s growing tired of me too and my negative outlook. The only person i’m really sticking around for is my best friend but i fear i’m not really strong enough for this anymore and it deeply saddens me. I’m sorry everyone from the bottom of my heart. I really tried my best but i’m done so done. I’ll obviously stick around for my dad but i guess i was right when he’s done so am i. There’s nothing for me here in this sick world and i mean NOTHING.

He sabotaged all visitings from Potential new flatmates. Also he damaged interior. I locked up serverel doors to keep stuff secure, then he mangeld with the looks. Best part, I could not get rid of him. When we had to close the flat, he vanished. And due to the way our contract with the landlord was written, anyone could be Charge for everything. And since I was grabbable, I have to pay for anything.\n\nAfter the closing, I had to move back to my mom, quit my studies (was not possible to studie via Internet), quit my sports (no Club, with that acivity was nearby).\n\nI had done amything to keep the flat alive. Lied there for nearly 10 years, many precious memorys were attached to it. \n\nSo a huge amount of dept build up. Rent, repairs, private acountabilities, inscurance and now my student Credit wants tonbe panda back. Round about its all about 20.000 Euros. \n\nNo chance to pay that all back. I do not find a job, wrote hundreds of applications. From the most I got no answers and when something comes back its an no. Every new application drags me down more. \n\nSince last year my life stand still. Nothing good happens to me any more. Most days I just Stare at the wall or doomscroll though the net. I try to distract me with Videos and gaming, but it gets just duller.\n\nMore and more often I catch myself with the thought of ending it all. All that stops me from it is the knowledge of what amount of sorrow and pain I would bring to my family and friends. But the thoughts are getting louder and louder. \n\nOne Person took everything from me, my home, my perspective, my laughter.\nWould be better for him I never find him.\n\n",

      "selftext": "I really could do with some reassurance or at least honesty. I'm 20f, diagnosed with cptsd due to sexual abuse in my childhood. Then three and a half years around someone who took advantage of the fact I was autistic and abused me long term. Then I met someone at 17, moved out with him at age 18. That was my first proper incident of domestic abuse and since moving back in with my parents I've become agoraphobic. I'm on the waiting list for treatment after getting a diagnosis of cptsd. Also on a lot of medication.\nRecently I've had to go through a blocking spree on social media because the person who abused me for 3 and a half years is trying to become a content creator now. It was mostly my friend and girlfriend who looked through properly. But seeing their face, how they speak. It set me back so much recently. The physical and mental state they left me in was something I'll never really forget. The stress was so bad Ive had stomach and bowel issues since (that have sent me to hospital) \n\nI just hate knowing they are alive. These memories faded over time especially while dealing with the most recent person. Its so overwhelming all I want to do is sleep during the day. I cant make myself do much. Funny thing is it sounds so dodgy for me to say I've experienced this much abuse. But I think I'm just a magent to creeps. I hate it so much. I hate knowing the people who make me vomit and hyperventilate are doing so much more with their lives. Im in therapy even though I'm waiting for my proper treatment. I just dont feel any hope knowing they both still exist. Is there actually any other way out or am I stuck? \n\nTLDR: Id rather be dead than knowing the people who caused my cptsd are still alive and doing better than me",

When I was younger I would tell my classmates how I would kill them and hide the body I thought it was funny I thought it was what everyone thought of.

Ive seen suicide photos which I wasn't sad scared shocked or anything just a weird mix of peace and desire. I don't want to killmyself persay just be alive while I slowly rot. I want to feel the worms and maggots eat my body and the skin peeling off my body. I want to feel my bones break. Not because of the desire for pain. I know it's wrong I feel like I monster I haven't even told my family or my closest friends, it's not normal is it? My friends talk about suicide but that's not what i want I don't want to kill myself and it to be over. I want to feel it I want to see it like I'm watching a recording. I want to rid my being of emotions that hold me down and be a fucking zombie rotting away. I already feel like one but I want to be the undead. I have these horrible mood swings of anger sadness and happiness that are unexplainable. At my lowest I crave death at my highest I crave death I don't want hurt anyone even myself. I think about death more then I would like to admit, I use it to fill the void in my mind, I've thought about ways I could die. Become a famous person and kill myself on stage or at home so millions would cry and be saddened by my death. I could jump infront of a train and traumatize a few. I could shoot myself in a mall or slit my wrists in a Uber. Is something wrong with me? ",

      "selftext": "Hi, this is my first time really ever using reddit. I’ve had it before, but I’ve never posted anything, so this might be atypical to how posts are done. I’m 19 m and I hate who I am. Even just writing this out makes me realize that I hate myself over nothing, which makes me feel even worse. I am currently in college and about to finish my sophomore year and my gpa is 3.2. I am taking 4 classes (several of which are online) and I’m struggling tremendously with them. I’m barely able to keep up with classes and sometimes have to use external resources to help me, which makes me feel worse. In contrast to this, as a kid, I was always gifted and coasted through school very easily. I did have trouble in high school due to depression which stemmed from being sexually assaulted as well as having 3 autoimmune conditions (Type 1 Diabetes, Hashimoto’s hyperthyroidism, and Graves’ disease). I was doing really well after high school for a while, but now, it feels like I’m failing in every facet of my life. I’ve smoked weed for a couple of years every night before bed as it was the only thing that made me feel at peace and helped me sleep, but I get labeled as a stoner by family (which I feel bad about because I might as well be). I don’t work because the last time I tried working and going to college I had a mental breakdown and had to quit, so I barely even have any money. I got introduced to Catholicism and joined the church earlier this year, but I barely ever show up. I have zero achievements in my life besides graduating early. I never did sports or anything besides marching band, which I also quit midway through my senior year. I constantly fail tests at college and have no friends there. I have no friends at all really, as I graduated from high school a year early and split paths from the friends I had there. The only things I actually do in my life are jump rope 30 minutes a day, meal prep sometimes, do homework/go to class, clean, do chores (laundry trash and walking the family dog), watch YouTube, hang out with my girlfriend, and other random bs. I feel like I’m not progressing at all. I feel like I’ve hit a wall that I can’t get past. It feels like my entire life has been a lie. I feel like a deadweight and that other people would have an easier time if I wasn’t here (I know it’s not true, but I still feel that way). I always had this impression that I was going to do something really important in my life, but now I feel like my life is worthless and that I threw that chance away. I have my family and my girlfriend, which are great, but they can also be a lot to handle sometimes. There have been a lot of shifts in my life recently too, the main one being the fact my girlfriend of 3 years moved in with me and my family. The only reason for that being that she was in an awful situation, and we had the ability to help her out. So, for about a month now she’s lived here and I love having her. I think having her here does put a little more strain on me, not that she specifically is doing anything wrong, but more so, I feel like I have to grow up. All in all, I feel like I’m falling behind in my life and I see so many other people my age or a little older way ahead of me when I thought I was the one who was supposed to be ahead. I realize I need a therapist and am currently working on trying to get one, but I just felt like I needed to vent and write all my thoughts down. If you have any advice I’d really appreciate it. I’m sorry if this was a waste of time.\n\nTLDR: I’ve been a gifted kid my entire life and I’m starting to fall behind and it’s making me rethink everything, added pressure from my family and girlfriend is making me stressed out on top of already feeling like a failure for not being able to keep up the same way I used to ",

This is sorta ruining my life at the moment as sometimes i dont attend soccer practise or my education as im worried about (i dont even know actually im just worried for what feels like no reason) i feel this has become serious enough as im having panic attacks through the night which is really fucking up my sleep pattern and making me tired throughout the day also ever since i started this course i havent been eating really at all (which my mom keeps telling me its really bad especially how i play soccer every day) and to add to that about my mom i dont feel like i can talk to anyone in my family about this and i cant talk to any friends about this as i dont have any. \n\nSometimes i feel its because I haven't cried in a while and ill think to myself i need to just cry and let it all out but i just cant, i try to, but its like there are no tears left. \n\nIm feeling really bad about this whole situation and didnt know what to do about it so here i am \n\nIve just started a new course where i play soccer and study for a diploma. The education side of the program is fine and i think its started pretty well however the social side of things has completely diminished any happiness i get from the education. Its not because anyone has done anything mean or anything like that everyone has been pretty chill. Its just i feel i overthink things but i dont know lile theres some situations where i feel confident and happy and then some situations where i feel like people try to avoid me because they dont wanna talk to me but i haven't done anything to anyone. This is really affecting me is soccer practice aswell because im cant focus and make dumb mistakes i cant pass the ball well wuth this hanging over my head i cant shoot i cant do any of the things i could normally. There are so many things i wanna say but i dont know how to say them so im gonna leave it there for now any help woyld be dearly appreciated as im sorta losing my will to live here.\n\nPs sorry about the awful grammar its 10 oclock and i cba to smarten  it up cause maybe no one will ever see this ",

      "selftext": "I'm eighteen. I'm in my fall semester in my freshman year at college. I commute twenty minutes each way. I work retail during the weekends, and the rest of my time is made up of almost nothing.\n\nI don't like my college. I didn't want to go here. The last two years of my life have been all around pretty miserable. I failed five classes junior year of high school and quit going. I spent almost a year just in bed. My mom told me I would get sores.\n\nI barely graduated. My high school career was filled with truancy and minimal effort. I wanted to take a gap year, because nothing else was making sense to me. I wanted to do something, anything. I wanted to feel in control. I wanted to feel happy. I wanted to feel adventurous. I wanted to feel like my life was mine rather than a world I was just watching pass me by.\n\nMy mom said no. The second week of August I paid my deposit for my current school and enrolled. It felt like another choice I didn't make. Something else that just happened to me. Something else I stumbled into barely conscious.\n\nSo, here I am. Life is still passing me by while I make no discernable choices in any direction.\n\nNothing seems in my control. I don't know what I want. Nearly everything I pass gives me an idea on how I could kill myself. Train tracks, roads, rivers, bridges. I don't even necessarily want to die; I'm juts terrified that this is how my entire life will be. Living like this doesn't seem much like living.\n\nI cut bangs in my bathroom last night. I don't know if they look any good. I think they're a little crooked, a little puffy. They're outdated, I think. But, cutting them felt nice. It was the first time in a long time I felt any semblance of control over anything. It made me feel like a person for a minute. I don't know how to make that feeling last any longer.\n\nI'm not sure why I'm bothering posting this. My head feels like its filled with fog. I feel like a ghost, like I'm already six feet under the ground. I'd appreciate advice if anyone has any. A quick ten step fix on how to feel alive, maybe. Life is for the living and, currently, I feel like I'm an unwanted intruder.",

It shouldn't matter to you , If I end my life. How raw can you get with your reply? Will you provoke me to end this? If you do, and I did die, will that make me live in your head? If it does, maybe you do have some humanity left, if it doesn't, cheers we are the same. I would provoke myself to end this and feel nothing. \n\n",

Whenever I tell myself it’s okay it’s never working I seem to feel more anxious. Dies anyone have any Tipps on how to change that. I doesn’t even matter if it’s a small or big mistake I always react the same. I just can’t seem to calm down when I make a mistake. I hate it.

      "selftext": "Okay so I’m 15F and I’m pretty sure I have undiagnosed depression or something because  I always feel down and sad for like no reason at all and i feel like I’m so unmotivated to do anything at all and don’t serve any purpose in life. \n\nBut recently, ever since this year that I turned 15 really I’ve been so stressed about not wanting to grow up and I hope this doesn’t sound dramatic or strange or anything but it’s true like I wanna stay a kid and I don’t wanna be an adult with much more responsibilities and stuff because I already can’t handle the few responsibilities I have now. \n\nI feel like managing bills and finances when I’m older will just bring more stress into my life and worsen my mental health. I feel like my health is worsening and I can’t enjoy my life or life in the moment because I’m always reminiscing about the past when I was 13/14. \nI know I’m still young and 16 is not old at all but it seems like every birthday I get more and more stressed out. I just wanna be a kid again where I barely had to worry about anything and play with my toys or whatever. \n\nI also freak out because I feel like when I talk to kids younger than me I feel too old and that I can’t relate to them and Its weird to me tht how when you were looking at kids that are your age currently when you were younger, they seemed so grown up but now actually getting to that age u realise the were not grown at all. \n\nIdk if 16 is supposed to be an adult or still a child like idk. I miss being a kid where there was more opportunities and the world seemed more open and I could be an astronaut or famous singer or whatever but now I’m actually getting to the age where I’m realising I have to be more realistic about life and it’s not exciting anymore. \n\nNothing excites me like it did as a kid and the world just seems so boring and depressing now. I cant enjoy things like a used to and idk what to do, is this what being an adult is like? Is this what my adult like will feel like? I have also been experiencing extremely dark thoughts recently of doing something to myself or doing things to myself but thankfully it’s just thoughts and not me actually carrying those thoughts out, but at this rate I think I might soon. \n",

I called the pharmacy and they said it takes 7-10 days to fill but if it is ready earlier they will let me know. I am now on day 2 out of ??? from going from 40mg daily to nothing and I am already feeling uneasy, my stomach is killing me and I am having anxiety attacks all day at work. I am ready to just leave work and go to bed and not wake up until my medicine is ready. Last night I did not sleep hardly t all and once I did I overslept and ran 45 mins late for work today. I just can not focus on anything and just don’t know what to do to help myself get through these next few days. I have stopped taking meds before but nothing like this. If there is any advice, it would be greatly appreciated :( ",

      "selftext": "My life has always been tough since I was a kid since my family always have trouble paying electricity and rent because they are financially irresponsible and I was always sad and even thought about running away or doing something bad to myself in high school. Don't get me wrong, my parents are good people, but it just gets nasty when it comes to money and their laziness and tunnel vision thinking.\n\nI find that the internet kind of saved me when I was in high school by being somewhat a troll and playing a lot of video games and read stories of people who are in a worse situation to make myself feel better and also studying and making money. Now that I get older, I feel bad about reading people's misfortunate to make myself happier, but it does help me to be depression free and mentally pretty stable...\n\nNow I am somewhat in a mid-life crisis again since I am out of a job for a few years and occasionally wonder if I am stressed because I have no girlfriend, job, house, nor a car. The upside of me is that I exercise a lot and also eat a lot to cope with it and find it really good for my mental health (only slightly overweight due to excessive eating out for socializing with friends the last few months and traveling). Since my parents were financially irresponsible, I am still somewhat supporting them and living at home. Without me, they won't be able to pay rent like back then. Sometimes I read post about people that are in a worse situation and it makes me feel better...\n\nTbh, it ain't that bad since I learned to be financially responsible in my 20s and early 30s and saved enough to be fine for quite a few years (or possibly a decade) and my investments are going good. I am single but I have a girl I am dating that really loves me so it's up to me if I want a relationship. Though she looks older than me (that's what she said), she's only in her early 30s, while I am in my mid/late. I do find myself attracted to her and likely will ask her to be my girlfriend but we have only been dating a little over a month, so I don't want to rush it as I am getting ghosted and rejected a lot this year maybe because I don't have a job. Originally this girl wasn't happy about it but she learned the situation and is fine with it as long as I am looking which I am.\n\nAm I a bad person for reading sad posts to let myself know that I could be worse and it makes me feel better? Am I evil or just depressed? Or just my way to coping with problems? I just wanna vent to make sure I ain't depressed or I am?",

      "selftext": "I am well aware that my problems are in my head. I know that I am a fully mentally capable adult. I do not have any mental handicaps or mental illnesses. I am honestly too lazy to live. I can do everything a normal person can. I feel like a freak alien pretending to be a human and I think people can sense that something is off when they interact with me.\n\nI can be responsible but *I just do not try hard enough.* I know my life is falling to pieces but I am too lazy to fix it. I know I could always be bettering myself, I just know my inner brain is choosing to not let me progress. **I desperately want to make a good life for myself but I'm too lazy and stupid to understand anything a normal person would.**\n\n# I just want to rant about how bad my brain is.\n\nI understand many things, I've had jobs and I've taken some community college classes from time to time, I was going to major in phlebotomy. This was in 2023. Throughout my entire life I have always been different. I come across as slow if you've ever spoken to me. I always took extra long to get assignments done in school and I never really had true friends growing up. I would talk to people but then they'd quickly just disappear. I've always felt so detached and dissociated from life ever since I was a baby. I always felt like I've been watching a movie while I sit inside my head.\n\nI don't know what the hell is wrong with me. I'm just broken to the core. I'm not like other young adults my age, they are so beautiful and have friends and can speak without mixing up their words, some are actually comfortable with their appearances and their personalities. I don't even feel human nor alive anymore. I'm just a ghost trying to pilot a body. They are just themselves and I wish I was comfortable with myself like how they are...\n\nThey don't panic when people speak to them. They don't slouch to hide their bodies or wear the same tattered hoodie for 3 years straight like how I do... I remember crying when I started maturing physically. I am just too childish and refuse to grow up even though I desperately want to be like everyone else my age I am so desperate that I get physically dizzy when I overthink. I am always dizzy and feel like my body is floating and it also feels like my body is wanting to fall over.\n\nI sound like a child with my speech patterns and I can tell that people look at me with pity. I am too stupid to even use my brain anymore. I am trying to subtract fractions in a computer math program and it's so embarrassing to be stuck at an elementary math level. I have passed geometry and algebra classes in high school because I studied like hell to learn it meanwhile everyone else understood the material fast and easy.\n\nI wish I could be put into a medically induced coma for the rest of my life.\n\nTo tell you how bad it is, I cant even understand a simple question people ask. I'm always daydreaming and cant stop. It is physically painful inside my skull to be present and grounded in reality. I am broken beyond repair I cant fix myself it is over.\n\nI feel like my brain is screaming at me whenever i force myself to snap into reality. i wish i was normal. i cant follow directions i cant even drive that is how much of a **moron** i am. I hope my country makes a program where mentally defective lazy people like myself can opt to end themselves for the greater good of society.\n\nI am embarrassment to my family and they definitely didn't expect me to turn into THIS THING. I used to be their wonder girl. They had so much hope for me when I was little. They probably thought i'd turn out super smart and beautiful. But I'm a shy socially inept possibly mentally disabled tomboy who hides behind layers upon layers of clothes. I hate looking like a woman. I'm stupid and being \"smart\" is not true despite what they say out of pity to me.\n\nI don't deserve to shower or eat. I don't deserve my loving fiance. I don't even know why he is so in love with me. I look (and feel) like a zombie and I am a person without identity and no personality no hobbies and no interests. I HATE MYSELF.\n\nI almost veered onto the sidewalk when I practiced driving the student driver car today at the program I am in. I am too stupid to retain information. I really do think I am broken... People like me should die. I am a waste of food and oxygen and materials. I fantasize about pressing a button where I die and a kid with cancer gets to live instead of a lazy bum like me. I just hope I die soon.\n\nThanks for reading. ",

The moment I stop being focused on a certain task, i collapse. It constantly feels heavy and tight in my chest. I dont have any appetite at all. I feel sick every time i try to eat. I really want to talk to someone and share my feelings, but i dont want to pressure and worry my friends. I have never even considered putting hands on myself, but as i think of it now… I am scared of falling that way, life doesnt actually seem worth it, if you live like that.  \nI write this in an attempt to fall asleep. Please, give any advice. Especially, on falling asleep, I always found sleep as a way out, but know i can’t even make myself fall asleep. I wake up in the night, and feel the urgent need to go outside and leave wherever i am at that moment. Hard to explain what I feel, but i guess,   sadly, but some will understand it. ",

      "selftext": "I have difficulty doing simple things such as doing schoolwork, brushing my teeth, laundry, and even showering. I know I can do those things, because I have before obviously, but it’s not effortless or easy as I assume it is for other people.\n\nI don’t FEEL depressed, I’m still able to be happy. But it feels kind of faint. I can muster up the energy to doomscroll or sometimes even play a game, but I never can for anything useful like studying, or basic hygiene. I don’t feel sad or drained all the time, just normal. But I can’t really tell if it actually is, because I may just be used to it.\n\nI saw someone say the difference between being lazy and being depressed is the guilt. I certainly don’t feel good about this, but it also doesn’t feel like the usual guilt I get. It’s more so ashamed. I WANT to be able to be productive, but I never *want* to. It doesn’t feel like a *can’t*, because it feels like a choice. Like I’m choosing not to be productive. But at the same time I’m always wishing simple things could be easier for me to do.\n\nThere’s not a day where I don’t think about suicide. It doesn’t always mean I want to, but it’s always a thought that’s just there. An option, more so a last resort. Do people really not think about it AT LEAST like once a week? Or ever? I’ve been thinking more about sh lately and a part of me is a bit concerned. I’ve had phases that I’m more confident were depression, and sometimes I wish I could feel like that again and I don’t know why.\n\nAnyway I just started Highschool and this is interfering with it heavily. I keep hearing that freshman year is really important so I want to get off my ass and just… do it. Get it over with. My school (acellus academy) is incredibly easy anyway, yet I have a hard time starting the work, which I’ve learned isn’t uncommon there. I have 0 motivation for literally anything, plus my school has no structure so it makes it even more difficult. I do better in public school, but I feel like without whatever’s up with me mentally I could be doing well in online school too. I just have no clue how to lock in or focus better.\n\nI read up on some posts also asking this question and I think I related to this one specifically: https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/s/5hVvpgklr7, but I overthink like crazy and it’s like one part of me is saying “this is obviously depression, just go to therapy instead of questioning it everyday” (i don’t because my weight/looks make me too insecure to even go to the grocery store) and the other is “quit making excuses and just push through it” (which is obviously easier said than done)\n\nI’m thinking about going back to public school after Christmas break in hopes it’ll fix all this, and my mom told me to get to at least midterms for all my classes before I do. But it took me forever to be only 28% done for the easiest one I have. I think it’s because I’m waiting to want to do my schoolwork instead of just doing it, but I don’t want that to be true for some reason. Maybe I do just want an excuse",

I remember when the break up happened i cried so hard it woke her up and she began shouting at me... in that moment the only thing i wanted was comfort...literally just a hug...my immediate thought after that was \"why me, why am i alive, i don't want to do this anymore\" and for days since ive been thinking this\n\nI have genuinely 0 plans for my future and honestly find it hard to even imagine me being able to do anything worth while...everyday i look at myself and question why im here...i see the joy in the world at points and love the people that are around me but at the end of the day when im alone- im alone and extremely exhausted with faking im okay...i think im so selfish knowing i have people around me yet im so full of sadness and hatred for myself.",

      "selftext": "\nI don’t even know where to start. I’m 15, and I’ve been in a long-distance relationship with someone I truly love. I thought I was doing everything right, being honest, loyal, and open, but it all spiraled out of control, and now I don’t even recognize myself.\n\nMy girlfriend is mentally unstable and obsessive. She gets jealous over things that happened before we even met. Early in our relationship, she had boy best friends and I didn’t like it. She wanted to hang out with friends I didn’t trust, and we fought constantly about it. I tried to respect her freedom, but I also had to set boundaries for my own peace of mind. I gave her my Instagram password so she could calm down, but it never helped. If anything, it made things worse.\n\nShe would argue about my past, my friends, and even innocent interactions with girls online. At some point, she logged into my account and saw reels of models I had saved long before we even met. She didn’t care that it was nothing meaningful. She threw a huge tantrum. I tried to explain, tried to reassure her, but it didn’t matter. I even stopped looking at other girls, focused only on her, and wrote paragraphs almost every day to show her I loved her. Still, she didn’t believe me.\n\nOne time, a girl followed me on Instagram. We exchanged names and hobbies, just friendly conversation. She flirted a little, and I didn’t flirt back. I just responded as a friend. My girlfriend found out, and it became a huge fight. She spat on me, insulted me, and threatened me. I felt crushed. I even hurt myself from guilt and frustration. I tried my best, but it was never enough.\n\nHer friends also influenced her, turning her against me. She blocked me on everything, and the arguments kept escalating. I tried to trust her, respect her, and protect her, but I was constantly walking on eggshells. At the same time, I’m dealing with my own family trauma, abuse, and pressure. I’ve seen people I loved behave cruelly, and it’s made me distrustful and wary.\n\nI still love her. I still care for her deeply, more than anyone else. I would cross any line for her, protect her at all costs, and give her everything I have. But the situation has left me emotionally drained, hollow, and broken. I feel anger, guilt, shame, and sadness all at once. I’m confused about what I did wrong, and I don’t know how to fix it.\n\nI need perspective. Have you ever been in a relationship where insecurities and jealousy are extreme on both sides? How do you handle it while keeping love alive, staying sane, and protecting yourself? I want to learn, to grow, and to understand how to be better, but right now I just feel lost.",

The one time I brought it up when the jokes were very occasional (years ago), he just said he uses humor as a coping mechanism.\n\nReading all of this probably makes him sound like a really dark and depressing person - but he’s not. He’s super functional, funny, and supportive. I’d want to write off these comments as just off-color jokes, but I know for a fact that he’s very educated on these matters, always uses the right language (like avoiding the word “commit”), and has lost a parent and nearly a sibling to suicide.\n\nI just want to know if you think I should check in with him or not. I don’t want to make things awkward or heavy unnecessarily.\n\n(I’ll probably delete this and hope to god he never sees it.)",

I’ve struggled with depression most of my life, but had it a bit more in control the last couple of years. But the last few months I’ve just felt like a ghost. I have no direction in life. I’m in a sinking financial hole where no matter how much I work, it’s like I can’t catch up. My career (not my job) has just died this year and the industry it’s in is collapsing on itself. I’m single in a city where no one wants a relationship, and spend every day coming home after long ass work days alone to a dog who has a lot of health problems. Every day feels like an endless sinking hole and I’m trying to pull myself out of it just to get through the day only to have yet another hard day where a bill comes out that I didn’t expect or something goes wrong at work. And I do it all again. And last night, while trying to talk to a friend about what I’m going through in my car in a street parking spot, I was reminded that the people are just straight up assholes. A man kept flashing a flashlight into my car (which had its headlights off and windows up mind you) to get me to leave. I fully crashed out and threatened him with a taser. It felt like I wasn’t even in control of my own body anymore. \n\nEvery day I’m just reminded that it feels like the world doesn’t want me. Like God has just abandoned me. It sounds so silly but like as soon as my life had no direction anymore (a project I thought was going somewhere was dropped), I felt a spiritual disconnect. Like God cut me off and was like “yeah, I have no use for you anymore”. And I’ve just been floating through life, trying my best to figure out a new direction or at least find comfort in where I am now. Even the little things I’ve been looking forward to have felt more like burdens and after I just still feel numb and unfulfilled. And with the state of the world rn, I’m not sure being alive is worth it anymore. \n\nI don’t even know why I’m posting this. I think I just needed to let it out. Sorry if this is too heavy. ",

I’ve been looking for an escape since I was young and still always felt anxious and low.  Recently I discovered how opioids can make me feel so light and distant from my issues and life.  I’ve always loved that feeling before you go to sleep where you’re half awake and half dreaming and being able to replicate it whenever I want is so awesome.  \n\nEveryone says you shouldn’t self medicate but why shouldn’t I?  I haven’t felt this good in years.  It has solved so many of my problems. Yesterday I found myself actually excited to go to bed and wake up so I can get high.  I haven’t felt that excited for anything in seven years especially not waking up.  I now care about my life and put more effort into it so I can afford more and keep the act up. After years of people dismissing my pain and feeling like I don’t deserve help I finally feel like I have a good reason to use mental health resources and that people will see that I do deserve help.  It makes me feel so powerful and in control and less like I’m trapped with my learned helplessness.  It’s the only good thing I have left in my life.  It’s the only thing keeping me going.  \n\nI’ve tried all the other bs to cure depression.  This summer I exercised, went outside, spent time with family, and relaxed more than ever before.  I still felt low and done with life.  I’ve tried journaling and therapy and natural antidepressants and they haven’t worked at all.  I’ve tried it all and the only thing that really helps is my opioids.  \n\nSure maybe it’ll get worse.  I don’t care.  My life has been shitty for years.  I could quit if I wanted to lmao.  I haven’t even told my therapist because he will probably want me to stop and I can’t do that.  I don’t know what I want but if anyone has any guidance or similar experiences I would appreciate it.

I socialize, got good grades, keep up appearances and hang out with my friends and yet at the back of my mind I wish some vehicles would just split me to half. Can't let people find out since I'm living in quite judgy community and not to mention how I despise those pity stares people gave when they found out something is wrong with you. Can't barely look at myself in the mirror anymore. I'm ugly and really hate how I look. I used to avoid mirror like plague in highschool and wouldn't even bother to care about my appearances. I hate how all those years I spent building my confidence back shattered in seconds when I look at myself. I hate it here really can't wait for this to end",

My questions are for those moms who have struggled with Major Depression. \n• Did you struggle with postpartum depression? \n• Did you stay medicated throughout the pregnancy? \n• If you did struggle, do you think it negatively impacted your baby? \n• Was it worth the struggle, or do you think adoption would have been an easier route for you and the child?\n\nI want to remain the best version of myself to a child. It scares me knowing the darkness that I have experienced previously and it’s hard to imagine caring for a small human in the midst of that. I know people say children are the greatest things to happen to them, but I just fear the postpartum depression would have a lasting effect on the baby and your marriage also. ",

Before y’all start spam-commenting that I’m wrong I’ll say why; First of all women often SAY that they want this but get completely turned off and back off or start cheating on you when you try to implement romance and nice acts in a relationship since I guess it shatters their image of you as a ”MAN”. If they don’t you most often end up in a ”happy wife, happy life” miserable relationship where you’ve got no sex, no chemistry and no happiness in the relationship or the woman starts to cheat on the side or breaks up with you when she’s found someone she ”can’t have” (those who know they know) with whom she ends up breaking up after 2w since he was only out for sex.\n\nFinding a woman to start building something with is EVEN HARDER nowadays. I don’t want to sound like a stupid i\\*cel who shames but most women today get passed from guy to guy every weekend and the ones who don’t are just like the rest of them; placed on a pedestal by other single, desperate men who make them think that they’re the most beautiful woman since men’s standards have plummeted down. This gives women the feeling of having infinite options and makes building and keeping relationships IMPOSSIBLE since they always feel like they ”could have better”.\n\nI’m tired of being lonely, not having anyone to do romantic things with, cuddle with, love and appreciate but at the same time I don’t have the drive to start dating and building relationships since it always ends in heartbreak and me feeling even worse and more lonely.",

      "selftext": "I know there’s a dysthymia subreddit, but this community seems more active and helpful. \n\nI was diagnosed with dysthymia (persistent depressive disorder) when I was 18 or 19 by a psychiatrist, while away at college.\n\nI am the child of a mother with severe NPD (narcissistic personality disorder). \n\nMy parents describe my younger self (before the age of 10) as a very serious guy. \n\nTheir nickname for me growing up was “Eeyore;” they always asked me why my tail was between my legs. \n\nI struggled with persistent suicidal thoughts from age 13-20. My mother told me to kill myself when I was ~15 — she practically begged for me to do it just so she didn’t have to hear about it anymore (I honestly don’t remember talking to her about it much, if at all).\n\nI have since forgiven her for this, but it’s hard to forget about, obviously. This was mostly achievable by understanding the ways in which to distance myself from a parent with NPD and create healthy boundaries. \n\nI would say I’m the pretty standout black sheep of the family — my views on morality, politics, religion, the state of our nation, the meaning of life, etc. all differ from theirs. We are constantly at odds, about everything, so I don’t involve myself with family affairs.\n\nI can’t emphasize how many times I have been told by my family that I need to “change my thinking” and that it’s a question of willpower and pessimism and a relationship with the Christian God.\n\nThe amount of times I’ve been called “negative” in my life makes me sick to think about. In my view, I am just a realist. \n\nI have had a lot of talk therapy. Personally, I found a lot of help by taking 10mg of Citalopram when I was 18/19 to aid me in getting over a lot of the traumas of being a teenager with depression. \n\nI no longer really go to therapy or take any medication, because I feel my relationship with depression is much, much better. I rarely have any sort of suicidal ideation, I never think about actually ending my life anymore, I’m comfortable with my thoughts on mortality, I don’t feel like I am a morbid or even negative person (my opinion of myself is much higher these days), etc. \n\nTherefore, I don’t feel it’s useful to pursue constant treatment — I think because to some degree it keeps me feeling more insecure? I don’t know how to explain this, but it makes sense to me. \n\nAnyway, to get to my question: I still feel a low grade hum of depression underneath the surface of my everyday life, and I do think it prevents me from ever reaching the normal peaks of joy others experience. I think I’ve been this way my entire life, and when I read about dysthymia, it doesn’t seem like it should last this long. I am susceptible to periods of worse depression than I feel right now, but I don’t understand — why won’t it ever truly go away for some of us? Can anyone relate to any of this? I think part of this is just that I have always felt so alone in this. \n\nTL;DR — it seems to me I was born with a low grade depression that persists and worsens, but never has truly gone away. Other people see me as a burden or a negative thinker, like I enjoy being a “pessimist,” but I feel I am the healthiest I have ever been right now, yet still feel depressed. For some of us, does it just never go away? Can anyone relate to this? I think part of this is just that I have always felt so alone in this. \n",

      "selftext": "Sigh. I don’t know why I’m writing this. Who’s even going to read it? I know it won’t help but I’ve got nothing to lose letting it out somewhere. At least I can say I said it somewhere: I don’t know how to keep showing up every day anymore. People say one foot in front of the other, take it day by day but when does that end? I can’t do this for the rest of my life. I’m alone with nobody but my cat and nobody in my circle I can trust or rely on.\n\nI feel like my luck in life has always been balanced but last year things started to shift and I’ve never been able to get back. My work adjusted our pay cycles which left me with less, then removed our bonus plan and took away my security. In January, there was a kitchen accident beyond my control that could’ve burnt down my building and since then I’ve had insurance people and uncertainty looming over me on what happens next. Every time I think I’m off the hook, another hook catches. Almost as if by design, then all my additional income sources died. Then my friend circle started to evaporate, leaving me with 1 10-year long friend who couldn’t care less about me these days but we kept showing up for each other until he didn’t want to anymore. He was my best friend and brother, and abandoned me when my life got tough. But that’s what’s always happened with me. People get infatuated with me and then drop me. I’m a good looking guy and you either want to sleep with me or want nothing to do with me. Thats how it’s always been for me since I worked on myself. I’ve always shown up for people and been repeatedly thrown away. I’ve been letting a friend use my car for free because he couldn’t afford his car and condo, and he was going to get me a second job with him to help my finances. He told me the job wasn’t being posted but secretly had his cousin hired and didn’t tell me. He still uses my car for free. If I try to talk to any of them about this, they just start talking shit about me behind my back. The alternative to not having them is having nobody. If it wasn’t for this friend who left my dry, I would probably not even get 1 text message in the day. When it comes to my family, I’m a gay man in a religious family. They are all tolerant but I’m single and watch them all live happily with their families. Sunday we had thanksgiving and I sat at the table with nobody speaking to me. No food was made for me because I’m a picky eater and all I could get was a plate of cold turkey. They can’t even be bothered to buy diet drinks for me when they’re buying 12 packs of drinks of every kind. \n\nBefore anyone says I should speak to someone: I tried that. My therapist, after my third session of trauma dumping all of this and even past molestation and more, told me I should book my next appointment with her when I have something more to talk about. I can’t tell you the emptiness I felt of being told my trauma wasn’t enough to keep seeing her.\n\nI can’t show up for people anymore. I can’t show up for the gym anymore. I can’t control my eating. I don’t want to go to work. I stare at my phone for hours not wanting to move. I look at food and can’t be bothered. I lay in bed after my alarm and don’t get up until I’m in a time crunch. I don’t know what to do anymore. I feel empty. Nobody even notices the changes in my behaviour or cares. It’s only a matter of time before work gets tired of dealing with my last minute time off requests because I just can’t do it that day. What’s the point anymore.",

I love him so much and i try my best to always be there for him, giving him affirmations/reassurances everytime it happens. I can say he has been improving a lot for the last 5 years, LDR.\n\nI'm initially a very positive person or at least i can regulate my emotions and feelings really well. But to be very honest it affects me quite a lot too. It is super tiring mentally for me to always have to be the extremely positive for him and it often feels like nothing works to get him back to his normal headspace. Being half-hearted won't do well for him too, he'd feel abandoned and ignored. So i always go all out tending to his mental breakdowns.\n\nI feel useless, i feel helpless, but i can't ask him to support me mentally because he's also the reason i feel that way. I don't want to go to my best friend because i know she'd tell me to just let him go because I'd get pulled in even more while trying to pull him up. It's all paradox.\n\nNow it's basically me left alone having these feelings all bottled up and pretty much have to handle it all on my own while i also handle his brittle mental state. Psychologist/psychiatrist is too expensive, it's not an option. I'm exhausted and drained and just wish my partner was \"normal\".

      "selftext": "4 weeks ago a girl reached out to me on a certain app and we started talking right away. A little while into the conversation, I find out that she is 15 (I had already told her my age). I also found out she lives in a country on the other side of the the world (which means we had a 12 hour difference). We would talk about funny and stupid things that happened at her school or my classes or her funny assignments over the following week. The conversation was never inappropriate. Not even slightly.\n\nI was studying for an exam which I had to retake for the third time at that point. All my friends had moved on and I stuck at home retaking classes online. I was at my lowest and I've never been more lonely. Which was why I kept talking to her even though a 20yo should have nothing to do with a 15yo. I know it was wrong and I'm not defending myself. One day she asked me if I had a crush on someone to which I said yes. When she kept asking me who it was I told that it was her. she said that she likes me too. Looking back, the guilt and shame is killing me. This was a lapse in moral judgement, I swear. I'm not some predator or anything. I can't even live with myself right now.\n\nAbout a few minutes later she tells me her bestfriend wants to talk to me. I told her to let her in, and so the friend joins the conversation. Her immediate reaction was to call me a pedophile (understandably so) and told me that if we keep talking she will come after me. The girl that first reached out to me immediately dissolved the group and apologized about the incident. I woke up at this point, and quickly told her that her friend was right and we should never have been talking to each other. She asked me if we could stay friends since there was nothing inappropriate in our conversations. I wasn't sure about what to say then but after a few more conversations I told her no. I told her that the age gap was way too large for us to even be talking. I also made it clear that none of it was her fault though, that I am the adult of the two of us and that I take full responsibility for what happened. I recently found out she was actually 14 and had lied about her age which is now killing me even more. We have ceased all contact, she is not blocked and insists that she will reach out to me when she's 18. What the hell was I even thinking? How could I possibly have a crush on someone who I haven't even seen a picture of?\n\nOver the past few days I've been experiencing a gut-wrenching level of guilt and shame and it's eating away at me. My mental health is deteriorating rapidly and I feel like I'm drowning. I've been told that there's nothing to be guilty about since the conversations were never inappropriate and that I maybe blowing this out of proportion but, I did confess my feelings.... to a minor. This morning I asked my mom if I could meet a therapist because with all that happened and the exams getting closer I feel like I'm going to explode under this pressure. She is surprised and concerned for me now which is burning me even more. I'm not that kind of person, I swear. That really was a lapse in judgement.\n\nWhat can I do to alleviate this pain? My mom told me she would get me a therapist (no medication will be allowed though) but I don't know whether this is the right move given the severity of what I've done. Will they listen? or is all this too severe for me to talk to anyone about? If I can't talk to a therapist, what are my alternatives? Would this cause trouble in my future if it ever came up? All things considered, what is my best course of action? Pls don't shame me here too, I'm punishing myself enough. Thanks in advance.",

But these episodes make me just shut me in my room n just slob around the entire day. \n\nI am sorry if i am complaining or maybe i m not even that srs. Just a lazy slob who thinks he is depressed.

The closest thing I can compare it to is when a shiver comes down your body. I forgot how it felt, I haven't had this feeling for many years (I don't remember how many, my memory's fucked). If you know what I'm talking about, please comment.\n\nFinally started therapy after finding it impossible to work anymore. Did everything they suggested. Have been on Lamictal for about half a year (diagnosed bipolar). Started Sertraline a month ago. About a week after starting Sertraline I finally felt happy, felt love for my close ones again. Started looking for a job, actually going out, socializing. I felt human again. Then after two weeks it was gone. I don't feel anything again. \n\nLast time i tried therapy (three years ago-ish?), they put me on Lexapro, which triggered a big manic episode. I don't remember how it felt exactly, I just know I felt human again. I'm saying this because I'm afraid what I experienced recently was just a really tame manic episode, that I will never feel happiness and love consistently without them. \n\nI've learnt to mask my depression pretty well, but it takes everything out of me. I've learnt how to act so I don't worry anyone, but I always feel like I'm fooling them. I feel like a monster for not feeling love for my close ones. \n\nIf you've ever experienced something like that, please tell me how you're dealing with this.",

You know how it goes, everyone expects you to be smart, kind, well mannered. It's hard. I cry over the smallest things. Whether I didn't get accepted in the finals of a quiz we or I got a low score on a test which resulted into me self harming. I've done stupid things in the past. Like extremely dumb things. Right now, my problem is my father blaming me for \"stealing\" his money because 5k pesos is missing from his bag and I have 2k inside my wallet. I earn money by doing essays for other students (without AI) because they ai check each and every essay submitted. Sure, I've done dumb things such as smoking. (Yes, smoking. At the age of 10 I started because I was so pressured to the point that if I made a mistake, I would self harm.) Drinking Alcohol. And I hate to admit it but stealing from them. The reason? I wanted a different life. And I got that feeling when I was with my old friends. I knew they used me but they were all I had. Yet I know this doesn't excuse my behaviour. It was so so wrong of me to steal but this time, I didn't take the 5k. Theax I have stolen was 400 PHP and whenever I do it, I feel so guilty that I wouldn't eat to save money and put the exact amount inside their wallet again or in their clothes. Okay, back to the topic. So earlier, my father saw the 2k PHP inside my wallet and started yelling at me inside his office, calling me a disgusting burglar. Im currently in my mother's car at the back seat typing this trying not to cry. I just want to die. I think I might commit tonight.",

(Bad luck I tell you) \n\nDuring all this time I was constantly being forced to take up banking exams (RBI included) which I did as it seemed like a stable career to them(with no preparation whatsoever as it was not the one I was interested in) \n\nAt 23 right when I was about to graduate, college had one of the worst placement seasons and was almost finalised in one when I got ghosted the same day I was scammed. \nAfter 2 months, got an interview at one of the credit rating agencies and almost finalised only for another person to get selected (who already had an offer but was sitting just because her joining date was pushed ahead). \nA month later, got a job in research at IT company on a project that was a government agency, worked my ass off, giving 150% only to realise my manager asking me to put my experience in other person’s CV for company to pitch another project. \n\nIn Dec’24 I resigned on the pretext of my ICL that had to be done in Jan this year and also my family was not happy with *my* job and constantly asked me to resign and go for government job. \n\nIn Jan, got my ICL and then was kind off fidgety for my career and in February I started applying again while starting to prep for banking exams, got an interview, one month of preparation for this interview was screwed by my luck and intolerable jabs thrown at me at home. I was so down due to this since it was all going went until it went downhill. \nIn April, got an interview with Big 4 and submitted assignment as my final round only to get ghosted again while I still continued with my prep for banking. \nIn May, I thought of having teaching degree as my backup and was told again as to if I am so money minded to go for CAT and continue focusing on banking. Alright. \nIn June, got an interview with government agency as YP only to be placed in reserve roster because my luck again is so on point. Reached out to manager from client agency from my previous role given I had good rapport but those guys ghosted. \nIn August, gave prelims for two banking and cleared one of them as well only to find out in September that my maternal uncle has cancer and undergoing treatment for the same. While managing this at home and preparing for banks (with no will at all) and endless applications and no calls later, I get the date of my Mains exam in October and with so much going on, I forget my prelims admit card and I am not allowed to sit for it even after furnishing documents required at that point while others in the same situation were allowed just because my luck is so fucked up again. \nIn 4 days, I have RBI exam and I have no motivation yet I forced myself to study for 5-6 hours each day for 8 months. I have been taunted with remarks like being 25 and with no career at all and how I am going to ruin myself as I don’t discuss things and am oversmart, sure. \nAfter 10 months into this year, I sit here with nothing in hand because what I wanted to do has been dismissed over and over and whenever i took my stand, was pushed with such remarks that may put even demons at shame. So since yesterday I have been having thoughts to finish it for once and for all and yet again today morning I had been applying endlessly, tailoring my application, resume and what not but talk about bad luck. \n\n",

      "selftext": "I just turned 36. It was my charizard birthday. Because charmeleon evolves into charizard at level 36. I bought decorations and a custom cake, it was expensive. I thought I'd give it a crack at not being a miserable recluse, my usual go-to for the past few years. The day comes, I'm trying to feel special, something that hasn't ever been familiar, and a \"friend\" asked me how it feels to be 36. I answered truthfully: it feels bad. She asked why. I replied that i never planned on living this long, I'm not having fun being alive anymore, being overweight and disabled and autistic and adhd and horribly traumatized dealing with c-ptsd and borderline personality disorder and anger issues and a drug addict. Addicted to meth for 4 years, except i can't feel it anymore when i use it. Nothing at all. How i hate myself and my life and how everything that brought me to this moment has deeply scarred me and I'm tired and have an endless reservoir of sadness within me, i was born all wrong and never understood anything including myself... blah blah. Then she told me that my shitty life is my fault because I \"shower in negativity all day\" and I need to \"brighten up\".\n\nOh. Okay. \n\nVery cool thing to say to someone delicately toeing a thin rope of willpower and whatever laughable semblance of strength is left within my bones to not off myself again, like I tried to last month. And on my birthday, a day that I never wanted or felt like I deserved because I was never important or worthy enough, just intrinsically, despite all my good deeds and my innocent tendencies and my strong moral compass housing a passion for justice... it was just never enough. Nothing I ever did, or do, or will do, will ever be enough. Not enough to matter. \n\nI thought I did try. I knew I did. I have been trying. I don't know when I gave up trying. Gave up on life, gave up on the world, gave up on myself. It feels as if I never cared, in the first place. Why should I care when nobody else did? Not the teachers I looked up to that scolded and dismissed me, not my father enough to stop drinking and take an interest in his kid's lives, not my mother to soothe her ego and replace cold aloofness with warm compassion, not any of the men I tried so desperately to convince that I was worth how difficult it was to love me, with how I wanted, needed, begged them to stay and care about me... the abuse I've endured at the hands of people I tried to trust. The mistreatment, the cruelty, the trauma I went through, trying to prove myself loveable so that someone, anyone who took an interest in me would stick around when it got hard. Because it always did. \n\nLife has been a series of traumatic events one after the other, stacked up tall in my brain, like a slideshow presentation playing on a loop. I've felt like my life has ended many times, I'd like to say starting when I became pregnant and had an abortion (huge trauma), but could be earlier like when my parents got divorced when I was 9. I remember my angry father hit my mother in the garage and scared her, she fled into the house and grabbed me to lock us in a bedroom with my father bellowing and pounding on the door as cries and tears of panic and fear were shed. (Also huge trauma)\nMany overdoses and and acts of violence peppered the timeline from then til now, missteps and mistakes, psychotic breakdowns and fugue episodes, maladaptive coping behavior that pushed the dirt under my nails of my own grave that I've been slowly digging. And I happily chose the chaos every time. I participated in what I knew was not good for me. I said yes to the meth. Enthusiastically. Why. \nI thought this is what I wanted. I thought this is what I deserved. I sought out self-destruction in the most subtle ways, as well as blatant reckless behavior that was ever so exciting and made me feel alive.\n\nBut here I am, wanting to die. If I become nothing, I will relinquish the possibility of witnessing any more joy or fleeting happiness, but that is a fair and welcome trade in my mind for halting the new growth of any pain and despair and sadness and hurt that is to be experienced. And the future guarantees only death. I feel things so deeply, I am scared to lose anything more that I love. So scared. I don't know where my breaking point is, or if it's something that I've silently reached and passed through already, just floating along with a dead spirit, masquerading as the living thing that chains me to this world. \n\nI spent my birthday crying and hurting myself, wishing I didn't exist, consuming drugs in the hope that my heart will stop. A passive aggressive suicide is what I hope for. I've prayed for it, albeit abhoring religion and not believing in much these days.. I believe in the power of the human mind, but I don't understand how I could possibly override these deep-seated core beliefs of self-loathing and desire for destruction. I don't believe I am meant to thrive. I don't think I was made for this world. One time I Freudian slipped \"i want to go home\" when I was wailing. I am home, I never leave home. Maybe home is somewhere else. I don't think there's anything after death. And that actually comforts me. \n\nThanks for reading my rant. I know I'm very negative, but am I to just hold it all inside? It already consumes me. I don't know. I don't know. I just want it all to stop.\n\n\n*My trauma plays on a film reel, over and over in my overactive imagination's vivid eye, until the credits roll, and they roll, and roll, and roll, and the theater is empty, it's only me, I'm locked inside for the rest of eternity, watching these credits roll, forever, all alone.*",

      "selftext": "I’m a 21yr old guy, and I have struggled with depression since I was around 18. For quite some time, I didn’t even know that that’s what it was. I just thought I was lazy, unmotivated, or broken somehow. Things really reached a breaking point last year (2024) while I was studying abroad. I got to the point I honestly couldn’t go on anymore, personally or physically. I ended up flying back home urgently and was shortly thereafter admitted to a psych ward. I just couldn’t deal with life anymore. \n\nSince then, it has been like every single decision I made physically, mentally, and financially has been self-destructive. I’ve gotten into this pattern of going after temporary highs or distractions that always end up tearing me more down. \n\nThe worst example of this would have to be the fucking weird rabbit-hole of buying unreleased music on Discord. It’s like gambling, honestly. The fucking rush of it, the risk of it, the sense of belonging it gave me and the community that I was a part of, all of it just literally kept me addicted, and I know it was a bad thing, and before I knew it was happening, I’d lost close to $15k. I’m embarrassed saying that number, but I guess it’s important to show how deep I’ve gotten inside this shit.\n\nOn top of all this, I was recently diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder. It explained a lot to me, i.e. the overwhelm of things, social exhaustion, black-and-white thinking, etc., but also, it caused me to rethink my entire view of how I have been living life to this point, and how I have dealt with life until this point. I’ve totally ignored my health. I used to have goals. like I wanted to run a marathon some day but now, even getting out of bed or eating healthy feels about as hard as running a marathon. I’ve lost a lot of interest in things I used to love to do, and I don’t feel like I’m even on the way to be the person I had hoped to grow up and be.\n\nI guess I’m not sure why I’m posting on here. Maybe I just needed to get this off my chest or whatever you call it. I feel really confused about wanting to make a turnaround, but not having the energy or belief that I could actually make such a turnaround, even if I wanted to. If anybody has got any answers or been through anything like this, either the self-destructive patterns of behavior, the depression-ASD thing, or financial regret, I would love to hear how you got started turning things around. \n\nThanks for reading.\n\n  \n\n\n",

I have suffered depression on and off since in my teens. Had quite a few upsetting things happen such as my father left my mother and us kids suddenly after it came out that he had cheated for years behind her back, deaths of grandparents, death of best friend and never feeling good enough. I have been working for the last 8 years in a high pressure job working with vulnerable clients who have traumatic pasts which we hear about most days. Over the years  I have found my mental health has been declining even though have been on antidepressants.  I did not take holidays for quite a few years as felt could not as no one to cover high workload if was to take time off and would not want others to have the extra work. When did have a few days off over Christmas break when office closed each year struggled to switch off as no routine. Made work the number one priority and lost myself. I have recently been diagnosed with severe depression,  burnt out and anxiety. \n\nI have been able to keep going and most people would not see I have issues as got good at keeping it hidden as have kept pushing everything down to keep working and keep myself together. Doctor mentioned high functioning depression in relation to the fact that have kept going even though drowning emotionally inside. \n\nI use to isolate myself alot of the time in my down time by staying at home just me and pet who use to help comfort me. When I did go out with friends and family I would put a literal mask on to disguise how really feeling. \nI recently had to put down my pet (16 years old) to sleep after a sudden collapse and the grief of that plus everything else had come to the surface and feel like I am breaking down. First time in over 38 years since have not had a pet.  Never felt this much internal hurt and pain before. Cannot concentrate on anything, feel so lonely, hate being home as all alone and missing the person who I use to be. \n\nI went back to my doctor and I was given a referral to psychologist and have doubled the antidepressants which two weeks later are finally kicking in and suddenly feel numb.  \n\nI feel that life is currently giving me a kick in backside to finally do something about all the issues and finally deal with it all. Just need to build my confidence back up again to get out of this job and sort myself out as well. ",

      "selftext": "Tw: suicide attempt\n\nI couldn’t attend my mom’s birthday in early Jan 2024, I still had a clicky throat from a cord around my neck the day before. It was her 60th, it was a lunch with a few extended family whom she always tries to impress. I phoned to say HB, explained that I was very unwell - she was clearly hurt and said something like oh you’re busy at work. I wasn’t fit to work at all, she knew that but it was like me working was a more palatable reason to her than me bailing because I was sad. In my family it’s expected that we soldier on and put on our happy face. I sent flowers instead. \n\nEver since then she’s made her own plans for her birthday and other events and just not invited me. I know family have tried to cheer her up by saying “just do something with us and if she wants to see you she’ll reach out, she’s welcome to come too”. But I don’t even get an invite or get advised the event is on. She recently went to visit my cousin and new baby in hospital without telling me. We’ve always done new baby visits together.\n\nI know she was very hurt when I didn’t go to her birthday, and she’s made this change to avoid that hurt again. I won’t be able to bring this up to her without crying and she often responds to tears with bemusement or sometimes indifference. I still want an invite, I’m not always depressed!",

      "selftext": "Some context:\nIm 17.5 years old female.\nI have a very low self esteem.\n\nFor about a year I had a low mood; not sad, not happy, but there was a time when I was more curious and more excited and happy.. and that is something that I can cope with.\n\nThe problem started a few months ago.\nIt started from being tired of school (I had my finals), but I still studied because of anxiety from failure. I got used to study until 2-4 a.m.\nIn the last month of school I almost lost it.. i couldn't study anymore, I just couldn't concentrate at all, but then school was over, but I was still feeling bad.\n\n3 months passed since the school year ended.\n3 months passed since I actually engaged in my hobbies. I love my hobbies, but i dont do them. I dont meet or talk with my friends for no specific reason. I self isolate. I cannot concentrate and therefore I cannot study. A big amount of the time I feel passive towards most of the things but i easily get angry. Every day, all of the day, I watch the same 5 TV shows over and over and over.\n\nIn the last month: Every week I get into these 2-3 days of emptiness, self loathing, blaming myself for my suffering and blaming myself that its my fault. I feel tired, hopeless, pathetic and lazy. Everything and everyone is boring. I can't do my chores and studies. I'm less hungry. \nAfter 2-3 days I get out of it, but I still cannot concentrate and I do nothing all day.\nAnd then this cycle repeats itself:\nMost of the week I'm just a little depressed and then I have 2-3 days of hardcore feelings of emptiness and hopelessness, and then again, I feel relatively ok for the next few days.\n\nCan someone relate to that experience? How do I get out of it?",

I tried to talk to someone yesterday, and I felt I bothered them, My feelings are bothering and overwhelming even for myself, so in the past I shut them down, and they are coming back. I had depression before when I was in middle school.  \nLately, I've been having thoughts of self-harm and death, so I try to not be alone, but I didn't tell others the reason. I stopped consuming food, It's by choice at the same time, it's something that I can't control.  \nI would be so happy if you guys tell me what is happening to me or a guide to the solution ?

      "selftext": "I'm a piece of shit, indeed it's really weird things to say to start your story but that's how i will start. In my entire life I've been struggling to show people my feeling and my emotion. Lot of times people often misunderstood me and ended up hated me for it. I began to created an invisible wall that make everyone happy with who i am and feel comfortable around me, this wall if i can describe it. Is like a mirror, whenever you talked to me you would feel like you're talking to yourself because I'm just imitating everything you do to make myself feel valid and fit in with you. The reason why I'm calling myself a piece of shit is because I'm bad person, i noticed that i could see a details on human that others can't such as the slight change of tone and their body language which make me understand how's their mood and whether they want me to be around them or not. The truth is idk when it started but i began to use this talent of mine to manipulate others for my own benefit, I wasn't hesitate to leave someone if it mean for my own safety. But I've always had this thought in me when i did all of this, do i really wanted to do this? Lying to me is something that become my daily routine, even the smallest things about how i felt, what I'm doing and etc are mixed with lies. I've always hated my appearance because i have this acne on my face that i had since 13 yr old. It get better now. And just this year i felt sudden feeling of emptiness, I'm tired of lying, manipulating and act like I'm this kind person to everyone. I stopped showing up and disappeared for quite a while, the surprising thing is no one asked about me, where i go and what happened. That's when i realized that i acted too good, and everyone just think I'm doing something else. But the truth is i been stuck with this emptiness for a years and this year it just kind of hit me harder. I go to psychiatrist and talked to them how i felt, in the end i got diagnosed with depression, anxiety and ocd. The thing is, I'm just wondering if what I'm being diagnosed with is true or not, I'm afraid that without i realize i manipulated the doctor who trying to help me. When he said i have depression i could take that because depression isn't uncommon things in human, every human have experienced depression, some of them overcome it and some of them just live with it. But i couldn't take it very well when he said i have social anxiety and ocd so i asked him about it, and tell him what i felt about what he diagnosed me with. They began explain to me that i have this things people called perfectionist where a slight mistake would bother me for entire day and that's where my social anxiety come, he said to me that social anxiey isn't just feeling anxious or panic. Lying uncosciously to make yourself feel better is included as social anxiety because I'm trying to make myself feels better. And then we talked about his diagnose about ocd( obsession compulsive disorder), i told him i couldn't go anywhere without having to check everything such as my clothes, there's one time where i have to go outside for something but i hate what i saw on the mirror, i hated the way my acne is still there, how i can't style my hair properly, how my shoes suddenly seemed bigger than it supposed to, how my pants is being too long and make me felt uncomfortable, how my ties looked and every detail that 99% chance that others would missed. And i still being pressed when this details are not to my liking. And that's how i realized all of this isn't normal, it because i have this ocd that make me do all of this things eventhough I'm fully aware nobody cares about it. I searched the causes of my depression for awhile. Is it because of my purpose? is it because i felt guilty about what I've done to others? And then i tried to solve it by apologizing to others, admitting that I'm wrong and being honest with them what kind of person i am. But i still felt this long emptiness in my heart, and that's when i realized. What i really wanted is to be understand and be seen, when i opened about my feelings what i want is people to listened to my story without have to compare it with others or themselve. It's pathetic indeed but i.... Just want to be seen... I want to live without have to act like someone I'm not. But there's more things to it. It was me, I'm the one who never wanted to put my trust on others.. it was me the one who chose to lied instead of being truthful, starting today... I'll be better, starting today I'll look people in their eyes, starting today... I'll stop running away.",

I was never diagnosed, quiet unsure but sometimes can feel. some people can't commit something because their just not that strong for anything horrible. I'm one of them. I want to live life but unlike how it is right now or has been for the past 10 years since the highschool. this is just something I wonder or talk to myself but could never share with anyone with possible grammatical mistakes. everyone matters, no matter what you've done, no matter how bad it is everything will be fine. enjoy life, it's precious, do what you ever wanted to change your life and live the way you always wanted to but never end it ",

He was confused as well but he cared about me. We tried to start something between us but it was awkward at first. We figured we'd spend time together and see how itd go. We both liked shooting so we decided to go into the woods to shoot whatever trash we found. We were walking along without our guns out when we heard a gunshot to our side. We both freaked out and hid before curiosity got the better of us. We got our guns out and walked over to where the sound was. In this large drainage pond, we just saw someone lying on the ground, motionless. We cautiously approached and I quickly realized it was a kid, maybe 15 or 16, that had shot himself. What made this even worse was the fact that he had botched it and was still alive. I remember looking down at his half missing face and just hearing the sounds he was making. He didnt really move much but he could move his arm a little. I dont know if he was reaching out for me or not. I think he could see me and he wanted someone to hold his hand. I just stood there. I didnt move. I just stared. I couldnt make a sound or move. I watched him as he died. He probably regretted what he did and he didnt want to die alone but I did nothing. Neither of us did. We left. We ran back and left. Neither of us said anything. We didnt call the police or anything. I always hoped that I would wake up and it'd just be a dream but its not. He died alone, and afraid. I couldve helped comfort him. I kept looking in the newspaper to see if anything was mentioned but I never did see anything. I hope theres someone out there who misses this kid too. I dont want his memory to be gone. My friend and I never spoke again. He dropped me off and that was the last time I ever saw him. I know he struggled with it like I do....but he lost his fight 6 months later. Now its just me. Everyday it gets harder. I see their faces. I never asked him if he was okay after it happened. I knew he wasnt but maybe if I had asked...he wouldnt have felt alone like I do now. I know im going to lose this fight, its just a matter of when. Im still here...11 years later...but it hurts more and more everyday. I close my eyes and I see them both. I have nightmares about them. I dont know how much longer I have but im going to keep going as long as I can.\n\nI could've helped them both, but I failed them. I guess I just feel like a horrible person. I dont want to feel this way anymore",

      "selftext": "I entered college feeling optimistic about change. I had made a vow to myself that I would not regress into the same depressive and anti-social behaviors that plagued me all four years of HS. And it worked at first. I scored 90+ on my midterms in classes where the avg was 60. I talked to people and successfully hung out with some during events. I began a running schedule as an unfit person, starting from merely .2 miles continuously to now being able to run a mile. \n\nBut then, all of the sudden, I collapsed. Within the recent two weeks, I found it evermore difficult to get out of bed and attend lectures. I was late on several occasions because it took so much effort for me to get up. I missed assignments. I can’t even study anymore. And after the welcome week events, I basically haven’t had a real conversation in 1.5 months. My midterms are in just a week and I’m completely fucked because I haven’t been keeping up with the material as I’m supposed to. I feel like the only reason I’m not bedrotting is because I feel ashamed and want to avoid my roommate as much as possible because he knows what I am and how weird I am. Most days, I doomscroll in the library and wander around campus as if I were homeless. When my roommate left for the weekend, I immediately slept for 16+ hours straight and bedrotted for another 9 hours without eating anything but a banana.  Everything feels numb again. I felt like I had hope before. I’m tired. My eyes feel heavy despite adequate sleep. I have no desire to do anything. I’m regressing into the same habits that fucked me in HS.\n\n\nAnd now it has me worried about the future. I’m undeclared (in between biochemistry/biology) on the premed track. How will I even build my resume for medical school as an antisocial loser? Doing so would require me doing research, shadowing, or volunteering at clinics. How will I even get a job? All of this requires you to have some social skills. But I’m terrible at it. And I can’t even seem to improve despite my best efforts. It feels like I’ll never become normal. Normal people just live their lives and are naturally normal. They never had to “self improve” to talk to people and make friends. It just came to them naturally. But for me, it is as if I have a natural flaw to myself that prevents me from attaining the lifestyle I desire. ",

I also can’t sleep due to the pain and am struggling to manage a part time job. Yesterday was one of the hardest days I’ve had mentally in a long time, but I’ve had a lot of hard days this past month. I can’t stop thinking about what will happen when I lose my only parent and am left like this. My part time job can’t even pay for my rent and I have no other family that would help so I feel like it’s a given at this point that I will just be homeless someday. When you don’t think you have a future worth living, how do you find ways to keep going? How do you make yourself want to keep going? I am struggling so badly with both right now. ",

I get it’s stupid to self diagnose but the only way I can be legitimately diagnosed is if I tell my father and I have told him a lot about my mental health and he either ignores me, says I’m just trying to skip school or he says that’s just life. The other day my sister (one year older than me)got broken up with her boyfriend of 6 days and she told my dad that she’s not feeling well and this asshole said some shit like that’s terrible and I’ll set up an appointment to get you diagnosed for anti depressants or some shit and she just said she is in a depressive state. I have told this faggot (my dad) a million times that I NEED to go to a psychiatrist or some shit and he brushes it off. So now I don’t know how to tell him or even if I should. Though I know if u don’t tell anyone other than my sister who legitimately gets pissed of if I say anything about my feelings I feel like I’m going to kill myself.",

I've been thinking about how I'd go about ending things lately, and I've caught myself staring at my knife or fantasizing about getting some more oxycodone when I get back home (I'm out of state in college rn) and taking enough to just...float away. And I realize I need help. I've never been good at opening up to people and realize I've set a bit of a precedent that I'm ok or that I have everything put together to the point where I don't know how to tell people I'm not ok without it seeming performative or disingenuous to the impression I've given other people. I don't feel very close to my friends, or if I can even call them that. I tend to distance myself emotionally (at least I'm self-aware, I guess), so I don't know and can't even guess as to what I mean to them. Will they care? Will it come across as dramatic if I tell them out of nowhere? Is there a right time or moment to wait for that I should tell them, or should I tell them now when I have these thoughts almost every night? Will they listen or brush me off like everyone else did back when I still tried to reach out?",

My foster parent died and my real parents never reported it and kept the money. I have literally never known love ever in my life and that hurts. I am broke, no accomplishments besides my kids, medicated for depression because ive been in some dark places and I dont want to leave my kids without a parent. Im at a point in life where i have no confidence left. Ive been beat down my whole life, told im not good enough. I never had real guidance and never had anyone love me enough to force me onto the right path. Apparently it makes me strong that I havent become an alchoholic or drug addict or degenerate, but I dont know why im “strong”. I want an easy life. I dont even know who I am and I grieve the life I never had and never will have. I hold it down for my kids but I am lonely and struggling. And the world does not care. People look for reasons to dislike each other and never think “maybe she needs kindness”. I feel like nothing I do will ever be good enough or enough at all. I am in the mood to give up on myself. Ill keep living but I dont believe in anything good for myself anymore. ",

      "selftext": "I guess the answer to that is probably an obvious yes lol but if it is I'm wondering if anyone has any advice on how to break the cycle. I'm currently doing college part time which is the only productive thing I do. Due to my income based housing and SSDI I can't go full time on college and the profit margins on the incredibly limited number of hours I can work aren't much. Additionally most places don't want to hire a 22 year old who can only give them 18-24 hours a week when they're other applications don't have that limitation, so I can't really change my college or employment. What I'm more concerned about is my home life. I pretty much do the same thing everyday which is watching YouTube videos and eating. I might hop on call with a friend but with my lack of interest in video games that's reached an all time high while talking is occasionally nice it isn't really super entertaining memory making material like it used to be when his PC wasn't broken and we played games together.  I know I need to find a new hobby but this where I'm stuck. I have a car but no money so I need to save my gas for family stuff every week. I've tried to get back into writing but my creativity and imagination have absolutely tanked and are nearly gone, and I can't write poetry anymore because all I was semi good at writing was about my feelings but I've done it to death. I sadly lack the ambition to learn programming otherwise that could be a potentially fun hobby with a couple friends who could do the art/character/story design which I could not do, though I'm hoping that eventually changes. I do want to start walking because there's a sidewalk that goes fat enough for a short walk, but I can't get my lazy ass to shower and I don't wanna leave all sweaty. Do you guys maybe have any ideas for how I can motivate myself to do anything? I think even just the walk would really help, but I feel like I could see myself continuing to do not much of anything for many more years and regretting it *a lot.* It's definitely not good for my mental health, aside from the extreme guilt for not working and only doing college part time the lack of anything new has made my mind play back old embarrassing or incredibly guilt filled regrettable memories a *lot* more. I know there's no magic answers and really I just need to start doing things, but I'm struggling to get that started. Might try to not allow myself to eat until I walk which is something I often do with college assignments until I get one or a few done, but I'm not sure it'll stick since my mind knows the walking isn't essential.

      "selftext": "I’ll try to keep this as short and concise as possible, but no promises.\n\nI’ve been experiencing a huge mental decline since the start of the start of this school year, my senior year. Long story short, I’ve developed a huge crush on the girl of my dreams, but I feel like I’ve ruined it after my depression got so bad that I went through serious withdrawals from the people I care about, as well as experiencing near daily complete depressive breakdowns in the back of the class we share together. It’s like I’m grieving over the loss of someone who’s sitting five feet away from me, and she either is too nervous to talk about it or just doesn’t notice, but that’s only part of it.\n\nI feel like a failure. I’m 18, with no driver’s license, because I’m too damn scared to drive after a couple of bad experiences. I was supposed to be able to get it in July, but I’m too much of a fucking introverted coward to want to get up off my ass to do anything. \n\nI’ve never had a job either, because no matter how much they say they could take me I would be too embarrassed to have my parents drop me off at work, and there’s no way I could have more than a three hour shift with their schedules anyways. \n\nI barely ever want to leave the house. I’m fine going to school because I’m used to it, but my parents basically have to make me go anywhere else. I have no motivation to but my effort anywhere but school. I barely hang out with friends, not that I get invited to shit anyways.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, I’m surrounded by supportive people, but I’m still so incredibly lonely. I’m grateful to have such caring friends and family, but I can’t help but feel so alone. I have a crippling craving for a romantic relationship, but at this point I’m debating on whether or not it would be a good idea, because I wouldn’t wish these feelings on anyone and I know that the girl I’m crushing on right now would want nothing more than to to help me, but being a burden is one of my biggest fears. I know I need help so badly but I don’t want to bother people (don’t worry I’m trying to get professional therapy set up so that should help). \n\nI life feels like such a broken record. I can’t get a job because I can’t drive, I can’t drive because I have the confidence of a deer in headlights, I have such low confidence and self esteem partly due to my inability to find a girlfriend, and I can’t do that for a lot of reasons.\n\nAnyways, I’m sorry for the rant, but I really needed to get this off my chest.\n\nTLDR, I’m a fucking loser and I’m worried I’ve set myself up for failure.\n\nPs: I’m not worried about winding up committing. I couldn’t even imaging what that would do to my family, and like I said earlier the last I want is to be a burden.\n",

I'm a homebody that likes to stay home with my dog. I'm also a caregiver for my ill parents and adult sister with special needs, so really the only time I'm home is when I'm absolutely busting my ass at work. It hurts so deeply to the core to have people seem so genuine and good like me that want to meet up and then I'm left sitting waiting for them with no response. I already hate myself and it just cements all the reasons I don't ever do anything for myself. It just fucking sucks living life to take care of those I love without anything for myself. I'm so tired of living, but I could never leave my family to fend for themselves. I guess I just never learn and keep getting my hopes up when people are interested even though its going to end up the same as always. Currently drinking alone again in a bar I was supposed to meet someone that asked me out. I fucking hate poeple.",

I've been in a Computer Science course for 8 years, yes 8 fucking years in college because I can't finish it, because I miss classes and I can't study, every second of studying or putting any effort into anything is excruciating for me, when I can muster the willpower to do something even remotely productive, I can only do it for 5 minutes, then back to video games, and maybe I'll do something slightly productive next week.\n\nI'm also completely reliant on AI to do any programming because I'm too lazy to learn shit for myself, even if I could get a job as a programmer I wouldn't be able to do shit without AI coding for me.

He preyed on one of my friends. My mom hated children, hit me, and abused me throughout most of my childhood and early teens.\n\nThat kind of upbringing destroyed whatever social skills I could’ve had. I remember my first girlfriend back in seventh grade — though, looking back, I doubt she ever really liked me. If she did, I still don’t know what she saw in me. I acted like a total crackhead back then. She broke up with me less than a year later and turned out to be a lesbian. I used to think she was bi or something, but either way, I blamed myself for it.\n\nThe rest of high school wasn’t any better. Now I’ve just graduated, and honestly, I’ve been thinking about joining the Coast Guard — part of me hoping I die in the line of service. I don’t have many friends, and my mental state is so bad that I’m constantly paranoid they’ll leave me.\n\nAt this point, I don’t feel like I have anything to live for — not love, not friendship, not family. I’m alone. And I don’t know what else to do except join the military. Not just because of the loneliness, but because I don’t really have any other skills. College feels pointless; I doubt I’d even pass the basics.\n\nI’ve deteriorated to the point where I’ve bought into antinatalism. I genuinely doubt life has any purpose — or that it even should exist. I’ve started viewing humanity as a literal plague on this world. We destroy the environment, we hate each other, we toy with people’s emotions, and we kill without hesitation.\n\nWe’ve created weapons and unstable energy sources that can melt people from the inside, burning their shadows into the ground in an instant. Thousands of lives can vanish into ash just because two people disagree. And all the while, we fight endless wars over whose god is “right”, Or who claims a land that is easily claimed and shared without bloodshed, or who's economic system is correct, killing millions in the process — only for the cycle to repeat.\n\nAgain. And again.\n\nWar. Hate. Spite. Sorrow.  \nTo me, it all feels like an inescapable abyss.\n\nI just feel lost.",

It’s like I forgot how to open up and talk to people my husband and I dealt with infertility, military life, we were both military brats, I ride the wave of my current identity crisis of being myself  while working being a mom and adjusting to life alone. I didn’t want a divorce but I feel it was necessary. I was getting so depressed everytime I saw my husbands face all I could see is the family and life I hope and dreamed for. Our infertility was due to his pro hormone use, I found out he lied about an ex girlfriend, he said she cheated on him and he aborted their baby that never happened , and I put up with finding out our infertility was self induced. I have a history of csa and had a child at 19, different guy. It was puppy love I guess, but my husband the relationship we had felt real and when I realized all the lies, him with holding his infertility for years before I found out and still being intimate with me even joking with me, teasing me we would have a baby and have a wedding some day. He took it all away. One night when I was drinking I called him and he said stop crying and show me your tits, a piece of me died, my life feels like a fever dream. I wasn’t a good wife. I made plenty of mistakes, I self medicated, I was harsh and never could keep up. I’m so used to beating myself up all the time, I just want to be alone because I’m tired of people saying if you want a baby just have a baby I didn’t just want a baby I wanted my husbands baby, half the time he just was messing with me to see how far he could push me, how sad I really was. I feel pathetic for still loving this person because I feel as it is my Achilles heel. What do I do how do you get over someone whom you loved and who hurt you, after all of my life events I just wanted to give up and not be here anymore, I got help therapy, support groups, got sober, even got a job at a ob gyn, the divorce will start finalizing at the end of this month and I think about it and I get numb. I miss the person who is sweet, but tbh it’s feels like I never knew him to begin with it feels like I don’t know who I am anymore, am I just crazy, I the crazy ex wife that can’t let go? Help anything would help, I don’t want to feel better i just want to move forward. ",

I was unfortunately given the choice to drop out of the 8th grade (2022) and now I have no education from that point forward, to say that was a bad decision would be an understatement. I was under the impression that no school would be the best thing ever, I was sooooo naive. School was my only form of genuine human interaction. So that kinda forced/made me develop social anxiety. Seeing my old peers living their lives and being happy while i’m at an indefinite roadblock feels so crushing, sadly i have nobody to blame but myself. Everyday is exactly the same and it is torture. My days consist of me just doomscrolling or watching tv and that doesn’t fill the void anymore. Not to mention how the very small town i’m trapped in has nothing to offer or do. \n\nI have many dreams and wishes but I feel as i was setup for failure. Sometimes i question if my life has any meaning and should i continue. \nHaving nothing to do just leaves me with my thoughts and they consume me.",

I never had such a good family to begin with, mostly only my sisters which I don't talk to much. Although , I see this person everyday and they always approach me with open arms. I constantly feel safe and seen around them but sometimes I feel like I can be too dependent on them. Whenever something big happens, I always go to them asking for advice, what to do and just for reassurance. And again, we think of each other as siblings and nothing else. For the first time in my life, I felt like I could have a bigger brother I could depend on a bit more and lean onto. But recently, I found out when he was signing a form document from my psychologist, he mentioned I was too clingy and dependent on him. I personally don't understand how I am, or I atleast always try not to be. I don't constantly text even when I feel like to. I always try to maintain a proper distance,but it seems like it's too much for him in a sense. I'm really not sure.. Can someone help me out pls. ",

I’m a 25 year old male that has returned to college as a freshman, i don’t remember how any of this started, but I’ve basically been depressed since I was like 6-7 years old. I have seen 4 psychiatrists, 5 therapists, and have been on 4 different anti-depressants (that I remember). Literally nothing has helped even .0001%. My latest therapist just kicked me out of her office saying that she “isn’t a miracle worker” and there’s nothing more she can do. That was like my 4th appointment with her. That kinda got to me a bit, especially because I just opened up to her about how I’ve really been feeling, and just told her I feel like therapists often give up on me, even though i am always trying my absolute hardest to work on myself. I no longer find enjoyment in anything I do. I do the absolute bare minimum to keep up appearances but when im behind closed doors i just do nothing because nothing makes me happy. And like I’ve lurked on old posts on this community and really have attempted to implement some of the advice on others posts, spending these last 4 or so years really trying to find hobbies or interests but there is nothing. I’ve joined volunteer groups to help others, even tried activities I used to love. But still nothing. I just feel nothing but absolute pain, and I can no longer restrain my thoughts from going straight to the darkness. To be honest I’m probably leaving out like 80% of my shit. I’ll do my best to respond but will promise nothing. I guess my question is are there people who just don’t get any better? I’m really holding out hope that maybe someday I may feel even an ounce better, but I’ve also run through the thought experiment of how I would feel if I actually achieved my old dreams, and to be honest, I don’t even think those potential futures are even really appealing to me anymore. Idk I kind of feel like I’m also just begging for someone to say that it’s okay to give in and take my life because I’m just so fucking tired. Idk thanks for reading my rant anyway",

For context I’m a 19 year old girl and I was having the worst depressive episode I’ve ever had and I just didn’t leave the house and barely showered and didn’t want to see my friends (im usually extroverted and i love my friends so this was a big indicator for my parents)and my appetite fluctuate so much, I was sleeping upwards of 12 hours a day on the harder weeks, and I was having random teary breakdowns thinking about how I don’t deserve to be alive. \n\nI had to up my dose over the months from 20mg, to 40mg to 60mg but now I’ve been on it for a few months and I got another casual job and was forced to get up early at 7:30 or 8 in the morning because of loud construction going on in the building next to us. These things in combination have made me so much more stable in my mood and I don’t feel suicidal or like mentally beating myself up about everything and I’m just getting stuff done more which I’m really happy about! I feel like myself again and I’m just so glad. \n\nPlease if you are struggling with depression reach out to trusted friends or family because it is literally like having a disease it affects your energy and your body processes (I’m a woman and my hormones were so off from being so depressed and anxious that my period didnt come for 3 months and there was no way it could have been pregnancy). Please take it seriously like if you had a really bad flu or infection, take the things your psych or doctor tells you to do as treatment like if you had a broken leg and needed to do physio. I know you won’t feel like it and it takes time to come to terms with sometimes, I know it did for me. But please be kinder to yourself and think of the people closest to you and they are close to you because they want to be and they care about you. I wish you all the best 💋🫂🫂",

I work almost full time just to barely be able to get by and pay rent to my mom to keep having a home. I smoke weed as almost my only clutch to get me through the day weather I'm at work or not. I screwed myself by dropping out of school (I am however trying to work towards my ged at least). I call out of work pretty often just because I feel so mentally down and can barely get myself outta bed. I've also just began to hate eating to the point where I'll eat maybe 1 or 2 things a day and just live off of that. Somedays I'll eat nothing. Not because I don't wanna eat but because food is just so unappealing to me anymore. I've been struggling with depression for years now and I've tried going to therapy multiple times and everytime it doesn't help. I haven't told my mom about this cause I know she's just gonna try and force me back into it most likely. I struggle with cutting. I've been holding back for my boyfriend but I can't say I dont always wanna relapse and do it again. Every little inconvenience makes me wanna pick up a knife again and relapse. I've considered suicide many times but I'm scared because I don't wanna hurt anyone I love. But everyday I swear it gets more and more tempting to just dissapear. I don't know what to do anymore I feel like I'm stuck and the only way out is too kill myself. I just wish it would get better. I know I'm only 18 and I've barely even touched base with what life has to offer but I'm so done with it all.",

I’ve never smoked or done drugs, and I don’t drink either. I’ve never been to a club or party, it’s just not my thing. I don’t feel comfortable posting explicit photos, or even many photos in general. I’m not interested in dating apps like Tinder. Some guys have shown interest in me, but not many, and I usually don’t notice. When I do, I always say no, because I don’t want to be with someone I don’t genuinely like. All of this makes me worry that I’ll end up alone as time goes on.

Maybe that's the problem. I always feel like I am being judged from everyone and i am withdrawn from society, life, friends... everything. I always end up comparing myself to others and every time i do this I draw the same conclusion:\n\n\nI have no interests, therefore I am not an interesting person.\n\nI am stupid. Lack of situational awareness (usually I have to ask others to gain the slightest idea of what is going on) and knowledge (I don't know many things that I should), bad memory (long term memory and short term memory are equally bad) etc. Many things that are related to intelligence... Basically everything is hard for me.\n\nI have porn, internet and food addiction.\n\nBasically I am Nobody.\n\nI feel the majority of people don't respect me and I don't blame them, even if I want to.\n\nI have lost respect from my brothers as well (and I am the elder one which makes it worse). I used to be their inspiration in many things. Now I feel I am viewed as a dumb, self pitying stupid fuck who has reached the age of 26 without accomplishing anything.  \n\nThe thing is I have tried to improve my life. But I always get anxious and I end up not doing anything, due to fear if failure or i do something and I end up making a fool out of myself. \n\nI also used to be the kid that didn't have many friends in school, who was alone in the majority of his school years and I had many many fist fights.\n\nI mean... Not that I am planning to do anything like that... But... You can't tell me that suicide isn't a logical thing in a case like mine.\n\nImagine reaching 40-50 years old and staying like that. Being a loser. Sometimes death is the only thing that brings us peace. I have thought of it many times. But I can't do it. Not yet. I want to try and live. But I can't do that either. I feel I am not capable. \n\nWhy I am like this? How can I correct me? How?",

      "selftext": "Hey r/depression,\n\nI need to share something I wish someone had told me years ago. For context, I've been battling severe depression since my teenage years. The kind that makes your limbs feel like they're filled with lead, and your thoughts echo in an empty chamber.\n\nAbout six months ago, I hit what I thought was rock bottom. I was cycling through medications, feeling like a professional guinea pig. The side effects were brutal - weight gain, emotional numbness, and this constant buzzing anxiety that made it impossible to think straight. I was desperate for anything that would make the pain stop.\n\nThat's when well-meaning friends started suggesting cannabis. \"It's natural!\" they said. \"It'll mellow you out!\" they promised. In my vulnerable state, I almost jumped at the idea of any escape. But something in me hesitated.\n\nInstead, I spent three days doing nothing but researching. And that's when I found site about medical cannabis. Not as a miracle cure, but as an educational resource that finally gave me clarity amidst the chaos.\n\nHere's what changed for me:\n\n• I learned about the complex relationship between cannabinoids and depression\n\n• Understanding how THC vs CBD affect mood differently\n\n• The importance of professional guidance rather than self-medicating\n\n• How to have an informed conversation with my doctor about alternatives\n\nThe emotional shift was gradual but profound. For the first time, I felt equipped with knowledge rather than desperation. I wasn't just another depressed person grasping at straws - I was an informed patient participating in my own healing.\n\nWhat ultimately helped wasn't finding a magic solution, but understanding the science behind different options. I still struggle, but now I have tools beyond just waiting for the next medication to work.\n\nIf you're where I was - desperately searching for answers - please know that understanding the \"why\" behind treatments can be as important as the treatments themselves. Sometimes the most powerful step is replacing desperation with knowledge.\n\nHas anyone else found clarity through researching treatment options? How do you balance hope with realistic expectations?",

      "selftext": "just joined this community today and would appreciate advice. i’m realizing now that i’ve never spoken to anyone who has dealt with depression about depression. the question is in the title, so no need to read further if you don’t want to. it’s long. i’m looking for tips on how to be a good partner while dealing with a lot of depression symptoms.\n\nabout me: i’m 30 and i’ve known i’ve had anxiety, depression, and adhd since at least middle school. i had a wonderful family but was often met with “there are lots of people who are less fortunate than you who make it work.” so i tried to get by. when i was 21 i started self harm, and a year later i sought help (therapist, psychiatrist, neuropsychological evaluation, the works). i found out i had general anxiety disorder, adhd, and dysthymia (persistent depressive disorder). i got good at managing it and hadn’t had a major depressive episode in around 4 years, and panic attacks became just once or twice a year. i stopped taking my daily depression meds 3 years ago, but i still have “as needed” ones that mostly address anxiety and panic attacks. i was really proud of my progress until recently.\n\ni’ve been with my boyfriend for a little over 2 years now. 3 months ago we had an argument and we’ve been in a rough patch since. the night it started, i self harmed for the first time in 8 years. i haven’t since and i don’t think i will, i was just so overwhelmed i had never dealt with that kind of relationship trouble. and after that i could tell i was more depressed, but i thought it was manageable. i suggested couples therapy and we’ve been doing that. i started doing random classes and other self care things. and i set a random date and said “just make it to that date, keep working, things will turn around.” i’m not sure why i thought that was a good idea. my partner and i got to that date (2 weeks ago now) and discussed that we want to keep trying. but nothing concrete changed, but we’re gradually getting better. but after that day two weeks ago, i can tell that i’m getting worse faster. i think i held on to that date and told myself to keep it together until then. and then maybe i didn’t have much more in me after that.\n\nthe intensity and duration this depression is really taking a toll on me and my relationship. i’m so disappointed in myself for being like this again (even though i know my depression isn’t my fault), because i worked so so so hard to get these depression symptoms under control and well managed. everything feels like too much and i’m feeling hopeless. i’ve had no energy these past couple weeks and i’m crying almost daily. i feel so alone, even with him. and we’re going through hard times, but i know my depression is also playing a big part. i know i need to make a conscious effort, and i’m looking for tips on how to work toward a healthy relationship when i’m feeling like this.\n\nthank you",

I just wanted to come on here to get some advice or to hear some similar stories as i feel so alone in this journey.\n\nIm a female (18) and my life is objectively great. Im at a good college, have good friends, a family that cares so much about me, and i am able to afford everything i need and want. I am also not ugly by any means and don’t struggle too much in that aspect. \n\nHowever, i am not happy 8/10 days. I feel like life is moving but im not. Even after attending a new college, im not excited anymore and just feel this existential dread most days. I try and get myself into hobbies i see others doing but i dont enjoy it.  I dont enjoy shopping or partying very much and many other things girls my age enjoy. Im not too much into relationships either and feel so behind in that aspect, but i really just dont have the drive for it. All i really enjoy is bed rotting and it sounds stupid but its where i feel safe, i dont have to think about anything especially if im sleeping, and its not high stress whatsoever. Part of it may be anxiety or depression but i dont know, ive always kind of felt this lack of belonging and need for something that i dont have. Im worried that someday im just going to lose hope in myself and give up because i feel so dull and can only distract myself for so long.\n\nIf anyone has felt/feels this way please let me know what has helped. Any feedback is appreciated ❤️Thank you\n\n",

I have a group of close friends all the way back from when I was 9 and even though they’re great people I always feel like the odd one out in one way or another. Another group of friends has practically slowly decayed since leaving high school and there too I was always known as the funny guy. Yet the moment I actually need some help it seems like no one is there to help.\n\nOn the romantic side I may as well just become a monk seeing as everything I try goes to shit even though everyone calls me a kind and helpful person. I guess the universe is pushing out some cosmic Justice for something I must have done wrong. \n\nAnd I don’t even get why I feel so empty and sad when I don’t have any physical illnesses, no money problems, no bullying or whatever similar activities, etc. It’s gotten so bad I’ve honestly had thoughts about ending it ever since the pandemic yet I’m still here. While these thoughts may not be as strong every day of the week, they certainly do come in waves and some days they are absolutely unbearable.\n\nIf anyone has something useful to share, please tell me.

I’m 17 now, and I’ve been going through this cycle for years. I’m doing okay, good even, and then late September early October rolls around and I’m back to feeling bad. Except this time, I think it’s worse than ever because I’ve been cutting myself for about a week now. I realize I’ve been self harming for a little while now by hitting myself, but last week something happened and I hit and emotional low, where I was filled with so much sadness and self loathing that hitting wasn’t enough anymore. I don’t go deep, but doing it is becoming more compulsive, and the marks are getting bigger and deeper. It’s hard to admit this but I know the only reason I stop myself from going deep or doing it too often isn’t out of fear that I’ll hurt myself seriously, or because it hurts, but because I don’t want people to notice, and that scares me a little bit. I feel guilty for doing this to myself, and can’t help but wonder what my loved ones would think if they knew. After I did it last night, I told myself, “I can’t do this anymore, I have to talk to someone I have to get help” so I skipped school today (I probably just used it as an excuse, since there were two tests today, neither of which im prepared for lol) to talk to my aunt, which I haven’t done and honestly don’t intend to do at all. I’ve just been laying in bed on my phone or sleeping all day, and that’s all I want to do. Every time I try to get help for my mental health, it’s like something blocks me from doing it, like I just can’t. I don’t know what to do. I know if I don’t get out of this and do something I’m going to ruin my grades, my relationships, my health, and my life in general, but I don’t know what to do and honestly part of me doesn’t want to do anything but just close my eyes and go to sleep.

Thank you sorry if this doesn’t fit here.",

      "selftext": "My story is long, complicated and too unique to share some of it here (read I don't want to be found irl which would be easy to do with certain details). I can give some background. I have a rare disease. Besides my disability, society views me as a non entity because of my age. My mother hates disabled people, thinks that they should remain in their homes never to be seen or heard in public. Literally in one sentence, on multiple occasions I might add, she said to me I am both too disabled to be in work spaces but also I don't work simply because I'm lazy and don't want to. My father is, I don't know what to call him. Abusive? He once locked himself in a room with a sibling and beat the heck out of them and I couldn't do anything to stop it. But most of the time he just calls people names and tells them how stupid they are. My step parent controlled my allowed food as a child. I ate only when they said I could and never any other times. I ate only what they said and could and nothing else. I started hiding food in my room around 15 only to be found out a year later or so. And I still hear about it today. \"You're so obsessed with food you hid it in your room, so disgusting\". My mother once threatened to go to court to get me declared incompetent so she could keep my disability money, thankfully she didn't do it and I moved out as soon after that as I could. My boyfriend has treated me like a roommate/secretary/personal assistant/maid/personal chef since we moved in together. His mother, by her own admission, said she regretted not teaching her boys to care for themselves and his father thought all us women were useless trash and we didn't do enough to keep house and care for our men. So when my mother tried to turn my boyfriend against me she didn't have to work very hard at it. As a result he is extremely self centered/selfish. Like we're getting 2000 dollars to spend as we wish, he told me he gets 1000 of it and I get 500 and the rest should go in his savings. He can buy new clothes but when I need them we don't have the money. Kind of selfish. My mother also tried to take every dog I've ever had and got angry at me for stopping her. She actually did succeed in getting one of my dogs because I didn't realize what she was doing until it was too late. She tried to take my child from me and complained to anyone and everyone that I wouldn't just let her have my baby. And this isn't even the half of it. But every time I go to therapy the therapist is like \"ew disabled person\" or is like \"why don't you just get some friends?\". I can't take antidepressants because of my medical condition. oh and I can't move away from these people. I just needed somewhere to cry and vent. I'm sorry if I'm a bother.",

They didn't allow me to treat my mental issues by taking meds that i needed so im really depressed since i don't go to therapy or even to a doctor. Plus, they are extremely overprotective and won't even let me walk my dog alone. I know I should leave their house, but they have made me so dependent that if I end up leaving home, i wouldn't be able to live by myself or even Just survive and i would sink into extreme guilt for leaving them. This and combined with the fact that I spent my whole life with Peter Pan syndrome due to things like sexual harassment during childhood made me not see a future. I never wanted to have a future because I found adult life miserable and boring, and because I felt dirty thinking that one day I would have to get married and have children,which is something I never wanted probably because I felt dirty as a child and felt that if I ever got married or had children, I would be a disappointment. I never thought I'd make it to 18, and when I finished school, I was completely lost. I had no plans for the future, I couldn't get a job because I finished school at 17, I had no friends. or family support, I had health problems and did not get into college , I moved out of state and still spent the whole year wanting to die and planning my death but not being able to put it into practice. Now I've lost the whole year and ended up not studying for the entrance exam that takes place next month, I couldn't get a job despite sending several resumes and I don't have the courage to kill myself but I can't see myself passing this year. The only thing that keeps me sane is spending all day on my phone doomscrolling and that makes me feel even more useless.",

I recently moved from home to a city (London) to finish the 3rd year of my degree I didn't manage to finish back in COVID during 2020 cos I messed that up, everyone I knew got there degrees and has gotten on with their lives and in good jobs, with relationships and settling down.

I have two failed relationships both of which cheated on me and left me for someone else. Dating is a chore, everyone doesn't seem to know what they want or don't want to stick around or everyone has unlimited options.

People keep saying it will get better but it doesn't. I'm working really hard to turn things around to at least get a better job but that still won't stop me from feeling isolated or alone. Like what's wrong with me? What does everyone else have that I don't that means people will be friends with them, date them, offer them job opportunities etc?\n\nI've even been having suicidal thoughts again recently and can't seem to shake them, when I bring this up to my parents they just think I'm being dramatic or say it's on me to go to the doctor etc.\n\nI cry multiple times a day, mostly when I get home due to seeing everyone living their lives and with other people and I'm just alone once I walk through the door.\n\nSorry that this is a rant I'm just struggling with adulting and my mental health right now and maybe looking and hoping for some support from kind strangers on the internet, maybe some advice or if anyone has any similar experiences.",

I’ve come to peace with wanting to be free, not remembered, evanescence.\nThe more you live with childhood trauma, the worst it gets as you age. never asked to be born, nor to experience all that pointless trauma. \nTypicals can’t date a person who has severe traumatic experiences. \njust ready to be at peace, been attempting the past 3 months with b-dryls. even tho im popping 11- 50mgs of the b-dryls ES.\nmy body hasn’t stopped, the way many said b-dryls would do. \ni don’t drink, but atp it’s seeming like something i’ll probably have to mix with those b-dryls. \ntypically just makes me doozy. i mean, it’s a muscle relaxer.\nI was originally planning on taking a bunch & then hanging myself in a push-up position, my legs & feet up against the closet, tie my hands behind my back & just doze into it. \ndoesn’t seem like it’d work the way i’d want it too. or will just take a long ass time 🙄 not gonna do anything in a public setting, preferably secluded. ppl stare & record, truly annoying.\nI don’t want to be in a coma. i told my parents to pull the plug if that were to happen. Told me they wouldn’t, rather me suffer. \nso i have to find a other avenue. \nalc & b-dryls, is seeming what ima have to do. \ntruly agitating that it’s this difficult to be free. \nmany that know me, will live on fine. ill be free from all the experiences & illnesses that are slowly decaying in my brain. \nI told my g-parents i don’t want any family members, “friends” or acquaintances they know (not me) at my funeral.\ndon’t want many to know i’m dead, just to be forgotten.\nat best all they’ll talk about is “how mentally ill i am” or “she left too soon, the illness became to much” all that b’s. 🙄not something that needs to be talked about. \ni don’t have friends, so that’s good in that department.\nJust annoyed with how long it’ll take. \nbeen trying to find rec’s, haven’t been able to find much other then b-dryls. \ni used to do lean, when i was really young, but haven’t as much recently, might mix, see if that’ll do anything. \nwish it was less of a taxing experience in setting myself free.",

So I just didn't go through with it. \n\nNear the end of the year I started forcing myself to do at least 1 thing to improve my life, even on days I felt too depressed to do much. And my life has improved in small ways but I need money to do the next steps, the next major improvements. BUT I CANNOT GET A FUCKING JOB. I have been surviving thru online panhandling and the help of friends but I don't wanna do that anymore. I wanna do more than just barely survive, I want to live. I have done so many job interviews in the past 10 months, I feel like I'm going crazy. I can answer a phone, I can handle customers, I can do data entry. Thats been my entire career. Please someone just give me a job, I don't want to be a burden anymore, I want to be able to afford things I need and want, I want to inprove my life, I can't do this anymore. \n",

I use dark humor and jokes to hide it because I don’t want people to worry about me. On paper, my life isn’t bad. I make good money, I’m not financially struggling, and I have a small circle with a few really good friends. But I don’t trust people easily, so my circle stays small.\n\nThe only time I didn’t feel depressed was when I was in a relationship. My partner never knew how I felt because I didn’t want to put that on them. But once that ended, everything came crashing back.\n\nNothing really makes me happy anymore. I’ve tried picking up hobbies, but they don’t stick. I see the world as cold and empty. I can be at a party, surrounded by music and people having fun, and just feel completely disconnected, like I’m watching something fake or distant.\n\nThere were times I felt like I didn’t want to exist anymore, but I never acted on it. I just feel really stuck in this dark place. I just haven't got the guts to do it yet. \n\nI don’t know how to explain it. I just keep asking myself, what’s wrong with me?

I think there's things that everyone can feel bad about like isolation/not relating to others, but it shouldn't *feel* as bad as it does under depression. Am I wrong about this? \n\nI also wanna say for as obvious as this may seem to some, I think it's the fault of stigma for not understanding depression is physiological just as much as its psychological. The negative feelings/experiences feel so visceral due to the low deficiency of serotonin, I think.\n\n Over the years, I've had this intense mind palace of experiences and I'm starting to wonder if it's all made of glass.

      "selftext": "I'm not suicidal, at least not anymore(?) But I wish I was never conceived. I've been nothing but a financial burden to my parents, but if I ever killed myself I'd only bring more sorrow to them. I don't want that to happen. I've been living through a trance-like state these 3 months, it felt as if I wasn't present. I can't remember anything except for how my social life was wrecked by my best friend.\n\nI've been experiencing increased forgetfulness, can't focus, can't sleep, can't get out of bed, just perpetually sad.\n\nI've disassociated from everybody; my parents, my friends, my past friends (that left because of the social wreckage). They don't really know what's going on, I don't plan to tell them, and they dont wan't to know either. My parents have never really believed in the notion that someone as young as me could possibly have a mental illness, or some sort. So I was never diagnosed, reason being that my parents don't know that therapists in government hospitals exist.\n\nI have exams this week, thursday and friday. I haven't started studying, although that is placed behind on the priority level.\n\nI keep having dreams about my aforementioned best friend, where sometimes she apologizes and we sit under a street lamp and exchange mutual regrets, and that is when I barely fish out an ounce of joy. That is, before waking up to homework. Sometimes it's her shaming me, infront of the school, like a physical representation of what happened between us. That is when I wake up gasping for air.\n\nI tried to detach from the incident; just tried to not think about it ever again, but it never stopped. It came back in dreams and in crying episodes, reminding day by day that love is just a world a grosteque creature like me can never enter. I've hated my appearance, my personality, my posture, my weight since forever. I can't remember the last time I was proud of myself. People make fun of me although I tell them about how it hurts me, but they never really care, so I just don't refuse the claims, the slander anymore. It's pointless trying to close other people's mouths. I will just listen.\n\nI can't go to sleep easily, and I can't get out the bed easily. I've forgotten almost everything these few months except the thing that happened. I'm scared of going to bed. I don't want to dream of her again.\n\nI cried for 2 hours in the afternoon today, for no apparent reason; although I calmed down and started feeling numb, I was laying on my bed at 1.41a.m. when I realised I have 44 pages of unfinished homework. It's 2.18a.m. and I'm still here doing my homework.\n\nI'm going to admit, I've tried to kill myself 3 times in my life. Although being just 15 years old. The first time was a knife to the wrist (i dropped it in fear, at the sight of the speck of blood), the 2nd and 3rd being attempting to overdose (we keep unfinished pills). I always end up feeling like a wuss because I \"couldn't do it\". Or that's what I tell myself to cope(?)\n\nI never wrote any notes. When I tried to reach out to my friends, it was always \"it gets better\" or \"stop thinking about it\", I figured, if they didn't care that much, then I'd only be another burden for them to get over. When I tried to tell my parents, it was \"stop thinking about it then\", which I understood, they've been raised on tough love. They've been through enough, I wasn't going to force them to listen to me whine about how my little friends left me.\n\nI don't see my attempts as a major thing, like the empathy I feel when it's other people. because now I had grown a fear of death, or to make it more palatable, a fear of making my parents sadder than they are. I love my parents, I'd never do anything to harm them. They've forever loved me like their son. I have no complaints, they've done their part.\n\nMy grades have fallen so much, and I see my life pointing in one direction; misery, a life without hope, without interest, without ambition. I don't have the motivation to get back up and start studying or exercising.\n\nI've spent the recent months doing nothing. I feel as if I have wasted my whole life.\n\nI only feel lost; comparatively to the depressive episode I was in this afternoon, I only feel a sense of numbness and immense disorientation. I want to start studying, but I doubt it will be of any use.\n\nI dont necessarily want to kill myself; but if I died to uncontrollable circumstances right now, I wouldn't really mind.\n\nThis may seem half-assed but I really cannot remember my thoughts during my episode of crying, of which I had so much that was bottled up and forgotten. This is just something I wrote out seeking for any kind of comfort in a state of numbness.",

One friend on campus and no plans for after I graduate, I need to go to grad school for my degrees to find a decent job but I don’t think I’ll be able to go to grad right off the bat, and I have no idea where to start for my gap year. Everything takes so much effort to do. A day ago I had a little “ritual” to make sure my health anxieties will come true, and I accidentally said yes! In my head when I was asking myself if I would die from a type of cancer.i had a wave of panic and dread and felt like I just wanted to die. I also have severe magical thinking and existential obsessions, and sometimes I think the universe tried to send me messages and I have powers to manifest what will happen to me. This has taken over my entire life. I’m too scared to try ERP because frankly I don’t have much faith in myself, don’t want to do talk therapy either because I can’t risk talking about my obsessions, but I feel as if I’ve accidentally condemned myself to dying a painful death and I can’t go back and undo it. So now I feel like I’m resigned to die. I just don’t have any energy to live, as far of my life is concerned it will be a push and pull of obsessions and compulsion, one shattering intrusive thought after another, one existential panic after another. My mind works on its own logic and I can’t go against it. No medications have helped either. I just get not joy from anything anymore and think my life is pointless. I would give anything to be a different person. To wake up in someone else’s body even if it were for a short time.",

I decided this in late september and hence I sorta pulled away from everything... friends , family , academics , and my boyfriend. He said I was acting cold one day and I felt so bad for being an ass with him because he had been nothing but nice to me. I felt selfish for being with him cuz like I'm just a burden to him and he doesnt deserve this. We talked it out and we ended up breaking up though we stayed friends after that. I deactivated my socials and attemped about a week after that. It didnt work and when I woke up I realized that I had fucked up everything by pulling away. No one knows what happened to me that time and just assumed I was sickor something. I feel so guilty for how I treated that guy and I want to go apologize to him or something but it sounds like such a guilt trip. \"Hey so I broke up with you cuz i was suicidal wanna get back tgt?\" Plus I feel like I would be burdening him with my mental health which is not something he deserves. I'm not close to many people and he was one of the people I was close to and ig we are still close but the distance between us is killing me. I wish I could tell him and apologize but I'd feel even more like shit. I dont even have anyone else to talk to anymore.",

I am going to open up about what goes On in my thoughts everyday. \n\nI have mood instability, and it’s very painful to go through the mood changes basically all the times. Yes I am on meds, they help sometimes, but, other times my emotions are way stronger and they tear me apart. I have been dealing with depression for years now and one of the things that makes me wanna finish all this is that i simply don’t fit in. \n\nI like creating content and have been on and off for a while now and I am also a psychologist. I am grateful for the people I have in my life but I don’t feel like I belong here, I also have racing thoughts about my life and the meaning of it and can’t find any! I am not ambitious, I don’t want to enter the rat’s race going on to enter the job market, I don’t like competition, it overwhelms me so much and there’s no mental stability in me to be doing this, I can’t behave like I am a product and have to do marketing for it, it absolutely disgusts me! \n\nLife has no meaning, I am into spirituality but I am starting to think it’s all coming from our imagination, everything is an illusion. I feel like I am watching me from a 3rd person perspective, it’s strange. Everything in this world looks fake most of the time, the people, the jobs, the connections, the whole system. It makes me want to die but I can’t hurt my family but I also know that there’s probably no success for me here. I want to unplug the machine. ",

      "selftext": "A year back I was really going through a hard time. I lost my sister and that same night I had a job interview which didn’t go as expected. I was completely down, so I went on an online platform just to vent a bit, hoping I might feel better. That’s when I met this girl from Europe. I’m from Asia.\n\nShe already had a boyfriend but we still continued to talk. We shared snaps, talked every day and night for hours, and honestly it felt good. I felt like I found someone I could really talk to. She was genuinely nice.\n\nOne day I asked her, “you’re in a relationship and you’re good, what if your boyfriend finds out we talk this much?” She said, “it’s fine, don’t worry, I’ll take care of it.”  \nWe became really close friends, sharing things about our countries, photos, calls, culture, likes and dislikes. We talked almost every day for a year.\n\nI’m 21 and I’ve never felt that kind of connection with anyone. When she used to go out with her boyfriend, I’d feel jealous. She felt the same whenever I talked to other girls. But she was always too cautious not to mess up her relationship, so she used to hide me from her boyfriend.\n\nOne day her boyfriend noticed my text and she panicked. She told me she didn’t want to talk anymore. I felt so sad. I asked her to talk to her boyfriend and sort it out, but she blocked me everywhere. I kept trying to convince her for 40 days straight, every single day, but she was cold and distant. She said, “yeah this should have ended way earlier, my bad, I did wrong talking to you but now I want to end this.”\n\nIt broke me. I was really sad for months, feeling betrayed, even though deep down I knew she was in a relationship. I stayed because I didn’t want to see her sad. I know I messed up too, but at that time I just wanted someone to talk to.\n\nThen a month ago, she came back again. She said, “I’m sorry, I did wrong, I shouldn’t have done that, I feel bad for leaving you. I want us to be like before.”  \nAnd honestly, I said okay. I know I shouldn’t have let her back into my life, but I did.\n\nNow though, I feel paranoid every time she replies late. I keep thinking maybe she’ll leave me again, and that makes me anxious and leads to fights. At first she said, “even if you get mad, I’ll never give up on you, I’ll fight back and stay.” I felt good hearing that. I thought this time it’ll be different.\n\nBut whenever she goes out with friends or studies, I get annoyed because I want to spend time with her. Sometimes I fight about that too. I tell her, “be nice to me even if I’m mad, my intentions aren’t bad, I just want to spend time with you, that’s it.”\n\nBut lately, every time we fight, she just says, “if you want to leave, leave. I won’t come back again, don’t worry.” And that hurts because just a month ago she said she’d never give up on me, and now again I feel thrown away.\n\nnow this time i blocked her and feel so bad ik i have work to do but i was about to heal but she came and ruined again for me. why do poeple do this i can't sleep well, i can't work well i constantly think of same thing. idk how she get's annoyed when i bring like im hurt when you do this she gets annoyed cause it makes her feel bad so i shouldn't complain. when i complain she goes like \"oh yeah im the bad person now\". Everytime i wanna go logical she get's annoyed and always avoid the conversation and when it's time to sort things she avoid and tell why to think of bad thing and be sad move on. Since that are never sorted out i feel bad all the time.\n\nEverytime when i complain something to her she can't listen and always gets annoyed cause im complaining too much that feels like im so much stuck, yeah the way i say things aren't really good way i get mad but i can't help myself.\n\nThe thing i feel bad about this is when she is busy and out she doesn't care cause she is distracted that time and she is like yeah you can leave if you want and act tough but when she gets alone she realize no shit where is he and gets hurts and reach out, i feel so unfair how can you be so inconsistent\n\nik now again i will have to spend time with gpt asking where did i go wrong and heal through this for months.\n\nI need a help how to move on, it feels so bad i have work to do and study, should i unblock her and resolve this? or just block her and never talk to her again and not even let her in my life again. Guys help me how to move on, everyday i wake up early cause i can't sleep after 5 am it's fucking up my brain i can't study i think about it a lot. how to handle this. this will ruin my career and my work.",

      "selftext": "\nI have CPTSD. I’ve had to deal with bullying and some issues at home for as long as I can remember and growing up I never had a normal life. I never felt like I could relax there was always something I was worried about, my parents arguing again, being left out at school… I learnt to just ignore all those feelings and get lost in my own thoughts and inner world. I now realise that was a big mistake, but I didn’t know better. As I grew up the only way I knew to feel good was to completely ignore those feelings and anything that was going on in my life, I created a fake reality I could escape to, and I already didn’t know who I was trying to change because of the bullying but after that I completely lost myself. Last year and until February this year, something happened that triggered those memories again. I started at a new school and the bullying came back except this time I had no friends and no one I could trust at that school and it made everything worse. Before then, I thought I was doing better (in a way I was) because I wasn’t anxious or depressed anymore but I was just ignoring everything that happened and daydreaming all day, so nothing was really real, and any inconvenience would make me feel bad again. When that happened, and I dropped out of school and had more time to think about my problems, I realised I had never fully healed. Things were slightly better but I felt lost and hurt, I didn’t know who I was or what I wanted to do with my life, all I had was daydreaming and whatever I could do to escape those feelings. During that time I was getting bullied, I stopped liking a lot of the things I used to like. I started working out and eating a lot (not because I wanted to but because I hated the way I looked) and that’s all I would do. When I dropped out, I just worked for hours on end trying to feel like I was doing something productive and I would just eat and work out and work some more and daydream as much as I could. After a few months I started dating my now girlfriend (we had been friends for a while and I’d had a crush on her for a long time) and everything started getting much better thanks to her. I started feeling more present and in touch with myself and life, I stopped daydreaming and even though I was still struggling with everything I mentioned I started feeling a lot better. But I was still struggling especially when I wasn’t with her (which still happens, I’m never truly happy unless I’m with her). I’ve tried getting back into my hobbies which has helped a bit but I just don’t enjoy them as much as I used to. I have no friends I can hang out with regularly and when I do I don’t feel so great, I feel weird it’s difficult to explain. With a lot of my hobbies, I’m just not even brave enough to pick them up again because of the bad memories associated with them, and because I just don’t know who I am or what I’m supposed to do most of the time, I find it even more difficult. I just simply can’t enjoy life. There are certain moments when I feel great like when I’m with my girlfriend or watching YouTube and talking with a friend, but most of the day it’s just overthinking and feeling weird. I know this is happening because my life is getting better and I’m also doing better (not daydreaming anymore, not self h**ming anymore, not pretending I’m someone I’m not, not worrying about the way I look or having unhealthy obsessions, being able to express myself in the way I’ve always wanted etc) but I still can’t feel okay because I feel like now that my life is better I’m stuck in survival mode trying to deal with all those suppressed emotions I was bottling up for so long. And even if I’m better I’m never completely happy except in the examples I have mentioned. And even then some days are really hard. I’m scared to do certain things because they trigger bad memories, I’m scared of losing the people I love especially my girlfriend and what I now have in life, I’m constantly on edge and scared and when I’m not I just feel numb. \n\nDoes this ever stop? Are you able to feel better and great about life when there’s so much to heal from and it’s all you’ve ever known? I believe it is because I’m already doing better but I still get scared, does anyone have any advice?",

Перестал употреблять, пошел в колледж, в 15 лет на первом курсе нашел девушку, думал что она та самая, 4 года мы встречались, да конечно как и у всех было много ссор, обид, краткосрочные расставания, но в основном все было довольно таки хорошо, 3 месяца назад мы расстались, это крайне тяжело, до сих пор не могу этого осознать, за время отношений у меня не осталось никого, потому что мать уехала жить в Россию, друзья куда то по пропадали, и в итоге я остался совсем один, по непонятным мне причинам я не могу найти новые знакомства, очень тяжело общаться с людьми, и я не могу просто начать общаться с кем либо, почти сразу после расставания меня уволили с работы, когда мне исполнилось 18 набрал кредитов а отдавать было нечем т.к. нужны были деньги что бы на что то как то жить, снова начал употреблять, в итоге стал работать в наркотической сфере и вскоре был арестован, пока идет следствие, но мне светит 7 лет заключения, как итог: В 19 лет у меня нет даже друзей, куча кредитов, срок в тюрьме, и мысли о суициде(((",

I find it hard to socialize, due to me being socially awkward, quiet and anxious.\n\nI feel depressed whenever I see others have fun and enjoy their lives with their loved ones/friends/partners etc.\n\nI am a really anxious person because of my officially diagnosed Mixed Anxiety-Depressive Disorder. I got tired of often feeling anxious and depressed. I wish I experienced positive feelings more frequently!\n\nI wish I had real, loyal friends who'd be there for me. I wish I had never been severely abused and neglected at any point in my life. I wish to have a more fulfilling life!\n\nIf you read through all of that, thank you for taking the time.",

Went through a break up and it’s been triggering panic attacks to the point I’ve been medicated and nudged towards inpatient (though I can’t, I have a kid to take care of). I don’t have a support system. I was r*ped at 20 which resulted in my daughter, no support from my parents or financial means to do much about it, so I had the baby. And I love who she is and who she’s grown to be. I would’ve offed myself sooner without her.  Have maybe one cool and relatively dependable friend, miles away and she’s great but 1. Were no where near close close, 2. I don’t like trauma dumping 3. Sometimes her pov does more harm for my metal than good 4. I wouldn’t want to constantly bother her. She has her own life. Other friends. \n\nI’ve been speaking with my therapist and her main piece of advice is just exploring different circles and I’m trying but even around people I feel like people just don’t naturally gravitate towards me. And that could be poor masking. I’m a 30 yr old, black woman. Nerdy, relatively untraditional beliefs (like in dating and stuff), introverted but always ready to help and try and engage with people. \n\nMy therapist said there’s always sadness in my eyes. She says on good therapy days when I’m laughing and excited or on normal ones where we’re just talking, there’s always sadness there. And people can see it and no one wants to be around someone like that but I don’t know how to fix that. Maybes it’s a desperation I’m giving off and idk. Idk how to fix whatever’s wrong with me. ",

I go to uni and I go home and I’m just empty. \n\nThere is not a problem with friends and I don’t even isolate, I go to uni events etc. What I mean is how horrible I feel seeing everyone managing going to the gym after uni and all those very mundane things that make up a life.

We had planned a date for yesterday, and as for my preparation, I took a bouquet of flowers, a candy box with a small handwritten note inside it, to convey how much I appreciate her, and gave her some snacks too. She gave me some cookies in return. But I really don't know if the date went well or not. I was talking most of the time and I am an introvert, so it was really hard for me to keep up the conversation. I have a stammering problem too, so whenever I did stammer, it made me feel worse. She is an introvert also, but it seemed like she wasn't interested in me at all. I've always thought of myself, as an unlovable human being, and someone only a mother can love. Maybe, this date was a sign? She said she had a good time yesterday, but she hasn't replied to my texts since then. All of this just makes me feel like I want to kill myself. I just feel so isolated and I feel like I am progressing backwards. I wish I could speak like everyone else, and could convey my thoughts like everyone else. It's a problem that's never gonna truly go away, and I wish I wasn't born with it :). Sometimes I really think of killing myself, but I don't have any willpower to do so, and think of how terrible my mom would feel. I just feel like I don't deserve love, or anything good in my life. I've thought about committing a few times, but I don't want to do it, and I don't want to live either :).",

Have been unemployed for ages and even though I do want a job I barely do anything. Have been a \"lazy\" person since childhood so I just wanted to know:\n\n1) How much of it is really MDD vs innate laziness?  \n2) How do I break this loop of doing, feeling nothing. (I am literally wasting what people say is the \"prime of life\", wasting away for days plodding by.\n\nPS: I know the \"theory\" of it (eating healthy, exercise, doing stuff), but how did you guys push yourselves to do it. Any advice would be appreciated. ",

Not because I'm tired, just because I can lay in my comfy, cozy bed and not do anything. I don't have to deal with people, I don't have to entertain myself because I'm in bed.

I had a wonderful relationship with someone who truly felt like my pillar of support. She was always there for me patient, caring, and kind. But then she left, and she is now with someone else. I still miss her deeply. The silence hurts the most, because I have no one I can really talk to about it. As if that was not enough, I recently lost my job. The company decided to let several of us go after our client pulled out, and it feels like the ground has been pulled from under me. Now I find myself sitting alone in my room, wiping away tears, surrounded by memories of better days. Every corner reminds me of moments that once brought happiness. I feel like I have broken into fragments trying to hold myself together, but slowly disintegrating inside.I do not really know what I am looking for by writing this here. Maybe I just need to let it out somewhere. I just want to stop feeling like this, but right now it feels impossible. Thanks for reading.\n",

My postgraduate studies start this week but I'm not excited at all.

I failed three times due to anxiety and didn't have the money to repeat again, and now I missed the psychological exam for my license because I could barely get up to drink water. The diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder cleared my mind, but left me even more desperate. I just feel like I can't go on like this, but I don't have the strength to maintain the minimum routine. I barely take care of myself during the weekend, now work (and commute) is becoming an even worse burden. I just wanted it all to end.",

My lows, conversely, are devastating. I become much more sensitive and cry daily for at least a week and a half over many things some i think are pathetic others i feel are reasonable, but at which point I feel that suicide is my only solution. I go onto Reddit, hoping to frighten myself out of it, which offers temporary relief, but I worry it won't be enough long term. I feel profoundly lonely all the time. My friends are kind, but I don't have the necessary closeness with any of them to discuss this, and I absolutely cannot speak to my family. My boyfriend is supportive, yet he is completely uncomfortable with emotional topics; whenever I try to open up to him, he does his best, but it invariably ends up upsetting me more. I feel as though taking my own life is the only way out of this pain.",

      "selftext": "I know this, in a sense, is wallowing in self pity but I need to get this out and rant a bit, please hang on with me.\n\nMany meds I take for mental problems probably amplify it a bit, but I remember being like this to some extent from early on in my life:\n\nBasically, I'm very self-centered and selfish and I can't care about people what people feel, say, think. People and their ideas, thoughts, feelings even feel bothersome and annoying at times. It's so hard for me to pay attention and care for them while interacting or/and conversating. What's weird is that when I see something bad happening to an animal or a good person on the news or everyday life on the street etc, I get really sad for them but that mechanism isn't there for people that are in my personal life. \n\nWhat's worse is that I feel like I want to be partners with someone romantically so much but deep down I know that, I'm not emotionally available, responsible, loving and caring enough for that. That's why it feels so unreachable, sad and hurting. I might be even looking for someone to suck energy from given my characteristics, who knows. It's always been like this, I was so scared of emotions, caring, loving people (not romantically, at ages like 4 and 5) even in my very early years like 4 and 5 but don't know what caused it.\n\nAlso, my want for a relationship just be a craving for sex as the first thing I seek in a woman is her beauty, I don't know if I'd be able to be with them even if they had a good personality but a below average look. This thing grosses me out a lot about myself but it's what I feel. You can see the selfishness here. Not wanting to give but get, and there are other selfishness stuff of mine I didn't share here.\n\nJust one thing, thinking of walking along a coast with a potential partner feels very warm and fuzzy though.\n\nLastly, any attempt to fix these issues just feels so forced, pointless, artificial and might-forcedly-to-go-back-to-step-one-ish so much that I don't see the point in trying.\n\nI really don't know what to do and I know that there isn't exactly an answer to give I just wanted to write this all.\n\nThanks for reading",

Usually my most comfortable time or the day is being in bed at night, but I felt scared to be alone, and be in the dark. I felt like I was having a panic attack out of no where. I was having such dark thoughts, thoughts that I SHOULD die. Not that I want to die or I need to die, but thoughts that I should die. \n\nI’m scared. I’ve never thought like this before. \nI’ve been going to a cognitive therapist, and im seeing my psychiatrist on Thursday. I feel like she’s going to tell me I should try going on something less intense (something that wont make me dependent) but still something scheduled. \n\nI’m just so sick of meds.

I’ll be utterly alone once my old dad dies in 1-2 decades. I have no more family or friends aside from him. I’m fucked. I’m fucked. I’m fucked. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what I’m doing. He doesn’t care what I do as long as I just do it. \n\nI fear I’m beyond help atp. Diagnoseda utism, adhd, depression, anxiety, social anxiety, ocd. Even my brain itself wants me to kill it.  \n\nThe only thing I have going for me is exercise. I exercise and write some garbage everyday. I say I write like that’s an achievement. I can’t produce anything worth showing off to my dad tho\n\nI’ll never live a happy life will I? Too much trauma. Im an adult and can’t move on. I’m fucked. I should fkin give up and die right now while I’m still relatively happy and healthy. Life’s not worth it. Idk what else to do other than die. I’m too weak to do anything on my own. I’m a burden. I know. Everyone told me that in school. I got it by now. I apologize for asking for encouragement. I’m too lonely and desperate. \n\nAlso it’s late. I can’t sleep. I’ll probably fall aslep now though I think. Just please say I’ll be okay okay even if it’s a lie. I mean it’s def a lie cuz y’all don’t know me lol. Even if nobody replies that’s fine. At least someone’ll’ve read this and heard me. I’m not alone in that sense! ",

I was supposed to go professional in my sport and everyone in my village knew me. I was happy and determined then about three years ago I suffered a brain bleed and had to give up my dream of going pro. I then went into a deep depression for awhile but i managed to suppress my feelings and managed to get into a decent college to study bioengineering but lately I feel tired all the time. I feel as tho I don’t belong everybody in my course feels so passionate about it and I just wanna get it over and done with. Recently for the first time in my life my skin has started to break out quite badly to the point where I hate the sight of my own face from someone who was pretty comfortable with how they looked growing up. I was walking across a bridge on my way home from class yesterday and stopped for a moment and looked out over the bridge and thought this could all be over in a minute, all the pain, the feeling of inadequateness could be gone just like that all I needed to do was climb up on the railing and jump but it was too busy so I came back when it was dark I even recorded a voice note to anybody that cared about me begging for forgiveness, but I couldn’t do it because of my parents and because they’re good people they have always supported me and always looked out for me, they don’t deserve a screw up like me, they don’t deserve to bare my pain, so I climbed down from the railing and broke down uncontrollably. I feel like a coward Idk where I go from here.",

      "selftext": "**Apologies for such a lengthy post but I just need a safe place to rant.** I (20 F) feel like my entire life is a sick joke. Some days I wake up feeling positive, only for 1 little thing to go wrong later, and my day goes to hell. I can't help my mind from spiraling. The environment I've grown up in makes it so that my brother has room to make mistakes, but when I make a mistake, it's like the entire world collapses. I blame myself for so many things that I've began to struggle with the idea of comprehending that some things actually aren't my fault. I've grown accustomed to \"punishing myself\" because it's \"what I deserve.\" My mother always used to tell me that I am \"just like my dad,\" (for context, he did A LOT of terrible things that left a traumatic mark on our family), so I grew up believing I was just like him. Every mistake I made, every wrong thing said only made me more \"like him.\"  \nMy brother is diagnosed with a kind of speech/reading disability, so my mom has always given him leniency and more understanding. When I expressed my concerns of thinking something was wrong with me (such as me suspecting that I have ADHD, depression, and anxiety), my mom believed that I was claiming this because I was \"seeking attention.\" Still now, she refuses to help me get a diagnosis because she believes that it will \"ruin my life.\" (For context, yes, I know I'm an adult now, but I can't drive and I'm so far behind mentally that I don't even know how I can help myself with scheduling an appointment or what not). From the get go, every time I would vent to her, either she would tell me to \"get over it,\" \"suck it up,\" or argue that the trauma she faced was much worse, that I have no right nor reason to \"be depressed.\" Or, like mentioned before, she'd say \"that's something your father would do/say.\"\n\n  \nWhen I attempted during my senior year of high school and spent a few days in a mental hospital, I thought that, surely, my mom would believe me now. I literally plotted and tried to do so *in my school* because I was so depressed. Just recently though, like roughly 3 months ago, she admitted that she also believed that I did that because \"I wanted attention.\" She also explained how it felt like such a waste of money that I was there because of said belief and that I should've been in school. I felt like I was worth nothing in that moment. I just felt defeated. Every cry for help meant nothing because ultimately it was just me \"seeking attention.\" Oh, and to boot, when one of the *doctors* in the hospital suspected that I had *borderline autism*, my mom dismissed that was well. She also dismissed any panic attacks I had as me \"seeking attention.\"\n\nNow that I'm in college, the thoughts of \"trying again\" haven't stopped. The thoughts of never being good enough. The thoughts of not being normal. The thoughts of when my mom would compare me to my friends. The thoughts of it all being my fault and that I \"deserve what's coming.\" None of it has stopped. The entire reason I'm venting here is because I did poorly on a homework assignment due tonight (now past due). I couldn't finish it, I just sat there staring at the problems hoping they'd solve themselves because I'm apparently so stupid that I couldn't flipping figure them out. I've gotten to the point where I just expect to get a bad grade on everything so there's no sudden surprises when I do. I just want to give up. I want to drop out of college, take my things and disappear. For good. I'm so sick and tired of being here haunted by these thoughts of everything being my fault, being just like my dad, and being a big fat disappointment to everyone, especially my mom. To make things worse, I have no room to fail this stupid class, or any classes for that matter, because I need to keep my grades up to keep my scholarship (can't afford to attend this university otherwise), meanwhile my brother has plenty of wiggle room to make mistakes and also has accommodations because of his diagnosis. I'm so sick and tired of living and thinking of violent/depressing thoughts as a way of coping. I'm not sure if I even have a chance at graduating or if my life can even get any better from here, and what's worse is that I still truly believe that everything up to this point is entirely my fault. I'm now just sitting in my dorm room trying not to lose it--I'm truly not sure what I should do from here.\n\n*(Side Note: This is a throwaway account, as I don't need anyone personal knowing about my crummy life)*.

      "selftext": "Hey guys so I feel so sad right now, so I went on holiday to Tunisia at the end of August and I really liked this girl I saw, but I was too shy and not confident enough to approach her, now I don’t even know her name, where she is from. nothing at all, that hurts the most. She was so beautiful and quite young but mature, must be over 18/19 years old don’t worry guys! but anyways one day I was by myself relaxing near the pool all day and she was on the other side and I as trying hard to get her to notice that I am looking at her and she did notice and I can tell she did like my interest and was happy. im really young looking, very short though so i have had issues with self confidence so i really liked that a beautiful girl was happy to notice me.\n\nHowever here is the bad part but please don’t judge me, I went on holiday with my wife of many years, we have had many issues in our marriage so we practically have been friends and we are never intimate, a lot of issues, she is currently not living with me right now, so I’m practically single and I really wanted to talk to that crush I liked. but what happened was when my wife came to the poolside, my crush noticed I had someone and was visibly upset and angry and also wondering why I was looking at her when I have someone, I know it’s wrong but I can’t help my feeling or urges. I jumped in the pool after my wife came and the girl came right into the pool with an angry face and I really thought she will tell my wife everything, but she was looking at my wife for 2 mins and then turned around and said something bad to me in her language, I don’t know whether it was in Polish language or not but ever since that happened, I can’t stop thinking about her, I only saw her once the day after and she was with her mum and she clearly didn’t want me to look at her, so I tried my best and that was the last time I ever saw her.\n\nNow I feel crap since I came back from holiday, I keep thinking about the girl, I liked how she basically told me off and put some sense into my mind not to look but now I want the girl even more, I’m curious to know who she is, what her name is, I been searching on Facebook every single day, it’s stupid I know, but I don’t even know where to start to ever find her, all I know she is European, she obviously goes to uni, is busy studying and it’s like finding a needle in a haystack. she caught my eye from day one as she looked so smart, elegant and clearly smart as she was reading books by herself near the pool, I loved that about her.\n\nI’m losing sleep trying to find her, but I am losing hope, and I am all alone at my home with my wife gone away for weeks at her mums depressed with her career etc, but I don’t know how to get over this crush. I wish I could find her, but she looked and sounded like from Poland, but then again could be Romanian, German, Lithuanian, I have no idea, I feel sad that I will never know her. I just want to find her and apologise and explain my situation and just be friends, heck I don’t even know if she speaks English.\n\nPlease help me guys on what to do, I will keep trying to find her online because my mind doesn’t want me to stop looking for her, I know its loser and stalking but that’s what my mind wants me to do to find closure on knowing who she is. it’s been 6 weeks now.",

Would it help? Sulk in it and maybe it'll just be a phase that I get through. I get lonely. My finances are struggling. I do things that break friendships. I often feel misunderstood. I do pray though. Prayer helps. But damn, it's hard. Im not like severly depressed. Life's not perfect. And the more I type, the more I realize that I strive for things to always be so right in my life, that when things aren't right, everything that is wrong weighs heavy on me. And when I cant fix what's wrong, the weight doubles down. It causes overthinking. Thinking that is no where near positive.  I have 'friends' but wish I could have 1 or 2 people in my life that just connect to my soul. I realize that sometimes I'm so guarded that I dont let people in. And so people dont get the full, authentic version of me. Side note: I'm having a bottle of wine, and it's really relaxing. Is it bad that when I drink I can reflect more about my emotions? Makes me want to drink more. I'm not an alcoholic but it's tempting. I realize I am going on a debby downer ramble. I realize that I want what I cant have. I miss being a kid sometimes.

From personal experience the \"right thing\" is what hurts me most. I do all the right things but people still expect more. I give up. Not out of depression, anger, or even sadness. I am just not content with how the world is and the honest truth is that I can't change it. So what's the point. I have the power to manipulate others to do what I want, but I don't. I choose to keep their information inside me while I rot. At least I could F\\*ck some people while I do. No difference anyways right? They did the same thing so WHY CAN'T I. I just have one more question, why is it that those who are the most smart, honest, kind always get preyed upon?",

And what's one of the first things the psychiatrist tells me? \"There's no medication for low self-esteem\" Which I know that I'm aware of how medication works. But the comment made me feel so... invalidated about my feelings. I know I have huge insecurity and low self-esteem problems, but why is she trying to ping everything down to that? I've been suffering through this for years, not just because I'm insecure, I also harm myself deeply, can't eat most days, I cry spontaneously without provocation, can't feel exited about nothing in my life anymore, feel hopeless constantly, can't do shit because I'm always tired and everything feels impossible and have constant suicidal thoughts. It's killing me. \n\nThe idea that everything I've been through and felt throughout this 5 years just narrowing down to my low self-esteem is mind-boggling, to say the least. I wanted to cry. \nI wasn't denied any medication. Fortunately, I believe she understood me a little more towards the end of the session. Either way, I tried talking with my parents (I'm soon 19)about my issues with the session and maybe trying someone else would make me feel a bit better, but my mom said that I \"can't just look from doctor to doctor until I hear what I want to hear\". \nThat hurt me a lot worse. But I guess I'm sticking with what I have for now.\n\nI just feel so lost, and I want to give up already, I just want a hug.\n\nEdit 2: I am immensely grateful for the attention this picked up, I feel better right now and with a clearer head than when I wrote this post. Thank you, everyone ",

I’ve been telling myself for decades that things will get better, but in fact they get worse each year. I feel this disease is eating me gradually. Maybe we’re just part of natural selection. I feel like I’m just not cut out/ built for this life. I will fight a bit longer, but I no longer cry or get sad. I feel so empty. I feel like I’ve leveled to a reckless depression. My thoughts, actions, feelings are unpredictable and times feel like self destructing. \n\nI’ve lost interest in the ways I’ve coped. I tried healthy ways that didn’t work, so then I tried substances. Since this year started, I am not longer doing weed or alcohol. I feel more suicidal than ever when intoxicated. Being sober isn’t much better either. I find myself staring at walls when I’m home by myself. I can’t watch tv, movies. Or even scroll through social media without it triggering me to feel depressed/ suicidal. \n\nwhen it’s time for life responsibilities (work, kids drop off, groceries,) I’m able to do it, but I feel like a machine, no emotion, no thoughts, no deep stimulated conversations with my kids. Just me doing what I have to do to get by and not end up homeless and so on. \n\nAs a result of this disease. I am the worst mother, worst wife, worst friend( I have none), worst daughter, worst sister. The worst part is that it’s manifesting to my loved ones  dynamic.

I remember when I was 14 my real dad threatened me w a gun and pointed the gun out of my head he told me he cannot control his mind, he might shoot me if I won’t be good all just because I was jealous about my brother they love my brother more than me, they never feel proud to me. I know it was my fault cause I was mean that’s why I end up w that situation but I hope my parents will be proud to me once, the fact my own mother never called me pretty and never say ily or hug me. I never felt parents love that u craved for my whole life, I cannot even open to them cause they will just judge me, I never had freedom the fact I never hang out w my friends since my whole life, I never had bf cus they said im only allowed when im 22 which was strange.

      "selftext": "Hello. I wanted to make a follow up post about the whole scenario that happened over a month ago where when my GF of 5 months came back from a trip and she is a completely different person now because of her depression. We just reached the 6 month mark and I we’ve had some ups and downs. We haven’t hung out in over 2 weeks outside of where we work. She’s entered a “don’t really want to talk phase” so I barely talk to her outside of work because she just doesn’t respond. The times we have talked in person though at work it feels good and natural. And the one time we did hang out in person it was amazing because she held onto my arm, hugged me, and even kissed me. The next time we hung out though she was very much not wanting to even though she was the one to invite me in the first place. We were watching a movie together and she basically pushed me all the way to edge of the couch and didn’t want any contact with me. I’ve also realized she stopped saying “I love you” So I’ve stopped saying it as well for respect for her. I’ve also done some heavy soul searching and I realize I was putting unnecessary pressure on her. I do think we were moving fast as a couple and lot of it was my fault because of the fact she is my first girlfriend and I didn’t want to lose something so special to me. So I apologized to her for that and she said she greatly appreciates it. But yeah recently our 6th month passed and I got her favorite flowers and gave it to her. She asked why I was doing this and I said it’s because we just reached 6 months. She genuinely felt bad because she forgot about it and I told her not worry because she has a lot on her plate. That week as well I was asking her a bunch if she was wanting to hang out on the Friday that just passed but she said she couldn’t. So she asked after I gave the flowers if that’s why I was asking to hang out. I told her yeah a little bit and she felt bad and said she was sorry and we will try something next week. So yeah it’s been a pretty rough month because when it’s going up for a day it feels amazing but then it goes down for like a week and i just feel this pit in my stomach.",

      "selftext": "I have always felt really really bad for a few hours after I wake up, fine at around evening, then really good and productive if I stay up past when I normally sleep to - I'm actually able to focus, I'm motivated, it's basically the only time I get stuff done. So I've kind of got into the habit of frequently staying up all night if I need to do stuff in the morning because otherwise I literally will not get out of bed, and will last minute cancel whatever it initially was - it's the only thing I've found that's vaguely worked, like I really crash at \\~7pm but I feel much more awake at 6 - 3pm if I got no sleep the previous night.  \n  \nI recently started doing illustration work and everything so I have requirements to like complete something by a specific date rather that 9 - 5 hours so I've ended up basically staying up an extra 3 hours later every night and being in a constant state of mild sleep deprivation because otherwise I genuinely don't get anything done because I just end up zoning out and lying in bed doing nothing if I have got enough sleep. But then obviously I don't really want to do this long term because of the cognitive effects of sleep deprivation or whatever.  \n  \nI know most of the time people say to keep a really steady routine and go to bed early and stuff but that's genuinely what I did for years, I had debilitatingly severe anxiety (which has got a lot better over the past few years) and consequently was really careful to get enough sleep every night and not stay up late, just to get the marginal decrease in stress from that. And over those years I just kind of felt absolutely *nothing.* Whereas now I often feel kind of tired and dysfunctional but like, at least I have 4 hours a day where I am actually genuinely enjoying what I'm doing, able to really focus, I feel actually happy and similarly am just more emotional in general e.g. actually able to cry, I'm about the same level of productivity, I'm getting romantic feelings for people again (after not having that for years) and actually looking forward to the future. And obviously I don't want to continue doing this because I'm concerned about brain damage from sleep deprivation, my short term memory is useless at the moment, but also I've been regularly feeling happy for the first time in years so I really don't want to go back to what I was doing before.\n\nSo I'm genuinely wondering if it's some sort of circadian rhythm issue that's been diagnosed as depression? And if anyone else has had a similar issue and has some sort of solution that isn't 'keep a sleep cycle that will make you completely emotionless for years' or 'miss so much sleep you can barely hold a conversation because you've forgotten the start of the other person's sentence by the time they've finished it'.",

This voice has only seemed to have gotten louder as I’ve gotten older. It seemed like an occasional intrusive thought before, but it is almost constant now. It is so hard going through life day to day while constantly hearing about how useless, worthless, ugly, stupid, unimportant, insignificant, etc, I am and how I should just kill myself. Do everyone else in my life a favor and kill myself. I’m nothing but a burden anyways. I don’t make anyone happy. I know for a fact (since I have been told repeatedly) that me being sad all the time just brings everyone else down. It is so draining. I can’t live the rest of my life like this, but I feel completely hopeless. None of the medications have worked for me longer than a few months. Logically, I know I shouldn’t kill myself, but I can’t stand hearing it and everything else I keep telling myself. Idk what I’m doing here, maybe just seeing if anyone else has experienced this and how they have gotten through it. Or maybe seeing if life is even worth living? Is it actually going to get better? I’m just so tired. Physically, mentally, emotionally. I can’t take this much longer. ",

Sometimes, when I do have food during the day, I get extremely bloated and I feel so so sick. After eating, I'm constantly retching and feeling like I need to vomit (I never do). I hate eating so much.\n\nI have an extremely labor intensive 9-5 job which distracts me from feeling hungry. Not eating does affect me a lot. It makes me feel fatigued and lightheaded. But I prefer feeling a little weak to retching, nausea, and bloating.\n\nI usually have pretty small portion sizes. Fast food and homecooked meals affect me both the same. If I've gone a long day without eating and then drink water, I bizarrely get intense stomach pains. Just something small I've noticed!\n\nI'm terrified that I've accidentally trained myself into not eating and feeling sick when I do. I have been eating a lot less than I used to. Coworkers and family have noticed it.\n\nI've been extremely depressed for a while and I'm wondering if all or any of these symptoms could be due to that? I definitely haven't had this little of an appetite before.\n",

I have these depressive episodes (like how a rash suddenly flares up when you experience stress or reaction to something you're allergic to). The triggers? Probably stress, certain memories, etc. I am in one right now. I swear everytime they feel longer and heavier. What's worse about this one compared to the previous one is that I cry a lot. Everytime I remember something or speak about something triggering, I cry. Hysterically. Like it just doesn't stop. Sleep doesn't make it better. Eating doesn't make it better. If anything, I feel sick anytime I eat. Like I'm going to get hungry, make food, eat the good. Then after I'm done enjoying the food, I start having these \"you shouldn't have eaten that\" thoughts. \"You're going to become fat at the rate you're eating.\" Eating and enjoying food feels wrong. In the midst of all of this, I'm writing pre-exam tests and I am currently experiencing what I believe to be, sciatica. It's like I'm stuck in a pit of tar, slowly drowning. The sad part is I know that kms is not going to help so I cannot even think of taking my life. And it's not that I want to anyways. I just want to stop feeling this way. I'm not okay and it breaks my heart that I'm going through this alone.",

When I get like this I just want to stay in bed and not even try. I can't even finish my degree. I feel like a looser I want to start hobbies but the ADHD makes it imposable to focus and the GAD makes me do everything three times. Nothing makes me happy and I want just sleep and day dream. \n\nLast time I was on medication I tried to kill myself because I couldn't recognize myself. I looked in the mirror and couldn't see me. It was scary. I have been off the medication all year and I have not spark or joy besides my BF. He keeps me together , but I have to find happiness another way right? Like hobbies ? I need to get it together . \n\n  \nDoes anyone have any advice ?",

      "title": "Not sure what to do with myself",
      "selftext": "I'm a 33 year old male and over the last couple of years I've had some major growth internally about settling down and finding the woman I wanna be with. I spent my 20s being polyamorous and making connections but essentially just sleeping around or being so into physical connection and fun that I wasn't focused on what I really want in life. Ever since I can remember I've wanted to be the best husband and father I could be because I never had a father but from my teens to 20 I experienced heartbreak and I think I just let it be easier to just have fun and not truly invest properly despite having a couple longer relationships and being poly with that person. I finally met this girl a couple years ago that was also poly and we hit it off so well and I felt that I no longer wanted to be poly but she didn't feel the same and it hurt, I reverted back to sleeping around to numb the pain all while knowing finally that I was capable of feeling strongly for just one person and hoping to find that. I had a shorter run with another girl I liked but she didn't workout and then I moved and got into a situational relationship with someone I wasn't sure about and claimed my polyamory as a safeguard and that went to shit, towards the end I had met a girl while in this relationship and I fell for her and that poly relationship ended and I devoted my time to her and it was great for several months but she was hung up on a long time ago ex and kept seeing him every time she would visit home and so it was a situationship for a year and that whole time I gave and gave hoping she would see what she had. She did not and I was left more broken than the girl from 2 years ago now. Since then I managed to pull myself together and be serious about making connections slowly and finding interest so I talked to multiple women respectfully and friendly while making interest clear and kept going back to one over and over in my head and we finally went out and she brought up being in a relationship but then ended it after a month and I feel more broken, hopeless and isolated than I have before because at the core we share the same values and morals and I feel she's letting some fear and anxiety win instead of just enjoying things as they come and learning about each other. I don't know how to cope with things anymore and I don't wanna go back to meaningless fixes to numb the pain but it hurts so intensely. I simultaneously know dozens of people and trust maybe half a dozen enough with my emotions or feelings yet I'm also so alone because I don't truly have any support that I can rely on, no best friend my mom lives hours away and I just don't know what I'm supposed to do anymore. I grew up getting bullied and picked on for being myself or being an emotional person or a blunt person so I barely know what it feels like to have someone that's there for you no matter what because when I have it's been brief and they've left too. I love myself and hate myself all at the same time, I know my strengths and weaknesses. I'm tall dark and handsome, in good shape and hit the gym, clever, sociable easily make connections and I care so deeply and have so much love but I also have a guard up because of past social trauma and when I let it down I'm just hurt again, I feel left out and forgotten. I constantly overthink and analyze and I worry that my future sees me ending things rather than continuing to fight through because I'm so damn picky when it comes to loving someone that the majority don't come close and I know I couldn't or wouldn't love them enough to go through it. Then when I meet someone that meets or exceeds the mark they tend to hurt me because I give my all and they don't know how to handle that I guess. \n\nI'd like a real friend one day, a ride or die kinda friendship and I wanna be loved and give love mutually but I'm lost. If there's anyone in the Phoenix area that would wanna be friends I'd like that just to put it out there. Thank you to anyone that reads this rambling.",

I feel tempted to cry at such a thought but can’t. I couldn’t if I wanted to. I’m lost in daily life and expected to plan my future. I feel as though I betray myself, every time I fall short of my expectations. I’ve been haphazardly drinking sweet poisons hoping for something good. My overindulgence has paralyzed any progress I hope to make. \n\nSometimes I feel like I’ll never amount to anything despite having great ambitions. I fear that at the end of my life, I’ll regret not trying to accomplish my dreams. It’s easy to imagine my dreams fulfilled, but easier to imagine they fade. Every single thing I need or want to do feels overwhelming. Each task is a mountain to climb and every goal a world to survive. I stop to think about this multiverse of mountainous worlds and collapse under the weight of it all. My mind is torn into pieces at the very thought of approaching all that needs to be done. My thoughts are blurred in the aftermath. As a result, I choose to run away from this quiet death and abandon all I aspire to be. I run from everything, because everything I feel is felt too strongly. My relationships, my goals, and dreams. I’ve tried so hard to change but I’ve been running my whole life. To change now… feels impossible.",

Because of that situation my home situation has become almost intolerable and my relationship with my mother is nonexistent. \n\nI have tried to explain how I feel to others but nobody really understands so i’m hoping someone here would have some advice. Recently i’ve been more mad than sad like when something bothers me it makes me want to hurt someone so much so that since I cannot morally do that I end up ripping my hair out and scratching myself. I’ve left scars on myself because of this and no matter what I do I cant fix it. Another thing is just an extreme feeling of exhaustion. Anytime I need to leave my room I just cant do it. My biggest example is school since it’s been causing me to be so tired I can barely stay awake when I get home. \n\nRegarding my self image problem I hate myself inside and out. I am not fond of the way I treat people and I do try to change that but its almost impossible for me like im so locked in the way I act I dont know how to change it. I also hate my weight and i’ve tried dieting, exercising, and even doing stuff that arent so healthy.\n\nAll of this has been so hard on me i’ve relapsed back to sh which I havent done since my 6th grade year. I was even researching ways to cut into the artery in the wrist just as a backup plan. I am so exhausted at this point and im just looking for something that will help me. What do I do?",

      "selftext": "I'm in a bad way and have been for a few years. I'm a male (25) coming from a family with a lot of financial hardship (my mum was left with my step brother as a baby, after his dad unexpectedly died. And my Dad got a serious illness, and was in and out of hospital constantly whilst me and my sister were babies). I've grown up in the same tiny 2 bedroom apartment all my life and have never had my own room. Ive always had to share with either my step brother (who is severely autistic) or my sister and parents, however not my dad anymore since they split up in October 2019. I was at university during this time, however I was struggling there due to the workload, difficulty finding people similar to me, and problems back home. With the break up happening my sister whos 2 years younger than me, developed severe Anorexia, her weight got so low that the hospital were very close to putting her in an induced coma to re-feed her and to make sure her heart doesn't work to hard. She was close to dying and was a shell of a person. She means the world to me, so I decided to put university on hold and go back home to support her and the family in such difficult times. I was hoping to go back to university at some point, but then came Covid. This made everything 10× harder as we were locked in our tiny house 24/7, my sisters help from a eating disorder clinic stopped abruptly and my university shut for the year. After nearly 2 years we managed to get through the covid lock downs and my sister was on the mend. Low and behold the whole family get covid...we were all quite ill but not too bad, just some strange and highly unfortunate symptoms, my taste went incredibly strange, everything tasted disgusting for 10 days, all i could eat was rice and kidney beans, my sister however, her taste went completely for a year. This ruined the growing relationship she had with food, and sent her back to square one. As it was a while since leaving university I decided to quit (a regret of mine) and I started a 2 year college course in carpentry as well as working in a bar, and supporting my sister. I thought this would be my career. I enjoyed the course, made some friends and learnt some new skills. However what the college didnt tell me is that this course doesn't constitute being able to become a carpenter or be employed as a mate as its not an NVQ accredited course. When the course was coming to an end, the teacher left and we were left with an old bloke who came in to help, but had never taught carpentry before. He was actually quite good but when the course was finished we received no guidance and told goodbye (albeit this cost me £3000). 2024 still working at the bar and my sister nearly fully recovered. Ive got basically no qualifications but I'm applying to Carpentry apprenticeships (few and far between, due to the insanely awful London job market) to no luck. Still trying to this day with no luck. Ive since then completed a level 5 TEFL course, because I like the idea of teaching internationally and its the best way for me to get out of this place, no way do I want to stay in this apartment with my family any longer, and finding a place to rent in London...you might aswell use your money as toilet paper. Now then im looking for teaching jobs, mainly in Asia, but i quickly found out UK nationals need a degree in any field to gain a work visa...oh why oh why did I drop out.   This was another kick in the teeth...decisions decisions. Start an Open University course in Education Studies was my idea, so i signed up and have since started it. But at the same time I'm stressing out whether its worth it, whether I'd even like a career in teaching, having to stay at home for another 3 years, currently unemployed and finding it insanely difficult to find a job, balding, developed a lazy eye, not finding joy in anyrhing anymore, not interested in talking to anyone, not a single match on dating apps, never having a girlfriend due to living conditions, losing my friends due to wifing up, dealing with my step brother, dealing with my mums mental health problems.

We’ve been together for 5 months and things were great! I felt him starting to get a bit distant over the past month but he never said anything was wrong so I just kinda assumed things were fine. \nOn Tuesday, we were talking about wanting to get into doing things again and he just said he hasn’t felt it lately. Then he says part of the reason is because he said he’s been mentally checking out of the relationship. I asked him why and he said he didn’t know but he’s felt disconnected for a bit but doesn’t know why. \nHe said he hasn’t really felt anything lately. He struggles with mental health and has struggled with substance abuse most of his life, recently stopped drinking. He said he knows he loves me but hasn’t really felt anything lately. \nHe kinda said some things that concerned me like that he didn’t see a future anymore but he knows that breaking up would be a huge mistake and that he feels really guilty about everything. I asked him if he wanted to try to reconnect at all and he said yes after some space and that he needed time to figure some stuff out. I asked him if there was someone else and he said no I’m just really struggling right now. \nSo the first day I went without talking to him, he texted me not even 24 hours later saying that he hoped I was ok and we had a little bit more conversation. He said he didn’t want to just abruptly end things bc things weren’t bad in our relationship and it has nothing to do with me but he does know he needs space. The last thing we said to each other was “I hope we figure it out” and he said “we will” \nI’m just very confused bc I love him and things were actually pretty good. Like I knew he had these issues when I entered the relationship, but I ended up having a huge impact on his life. We were going to recovery groups together, he stopped drinking, was working on cutting back the weed, wanting to quit it fully, got into the gym with me and began running with me. He said I changed his life and made him want to be a better man. I noticed then when he stopped going to the meetings and started to hole up in his room a lot, but I was understanding. I really worry about him and his mental health, like we were doing so good then things just fell off. I’m not sure what happened, he does have a history of mental health issues. \nI’m just not sure what to do here. I’ve been taking this time and space were giving each other to make myself better person for me and dive back into my hobbies and self love. It’s been really difficult for me because I miss him and I do have hope for us. ",

I am currently on just 5 mg of Lexapro and will take no Lexapro at all soon.\n\nWhat or how exactly is the Trintellix supposed to make you feel and is it more powerful than the Lexapro it's replacing?\n\nI certainly felt noxious and queasy the first couple of days but I don't feel as bad without the Lexapro as I thought I originally would.\n\nWhat is the Lexapro withdrawal and what is the 5 mg of Trintellix? I certainly have more energy now and more thoughtfulness; executive functioning also seems better in general, though I can be restless and have a hard time going to sleep.\n\nI also feel heart palpitations from time to time but that's probably the Lexapro withdrawal (since going off that gives you those, correct me if I'm wrong).\n\nYour thoughts?",

      "selftext": "This is my first post on reddit, Its been awhile that i felt i was in that position. Im thinking about killing myself but everytime i cant manage to do it because im scared it will hurt or make things worse, its a bit ironic considering my current situation feel like hell already. I should think that even it hurt a lil its nothing compared to what await me if i keep living. I used to live with my father but i fled his home because he kept verbally abusing me everyday even tho i never did anything to him & when i tried to understand his perspective of why hes always doing that, he just screamed at me and deflecting the question. At some point i couldnt take it anymore so i took my things and move out in secret without saying anything. I used to love my dad when i was a child but now i dont even think about him anymore, he could died & i wouldnt care. In that time, i was thinking it would be way better at my mom house...if only i could see the future, i think i could dodge alot of shitty situation and not being confronted to it, most of the time when shits hit the fan i cant do shit about it, i cant stop it, cant prevent it, trying to talk the responsible doesnt accomplish nothing like talking to a rock(maybe im just unlucky & everyone i met is an asshole for no reason it is what it is ik theres no point complaining but since i really cant do shit, complaining feel great its called venting maybe i guess). I used to try to confront about the situation like talking so i can understand whats the bigger picture but it never goes anywhere concret, since that didnt work at some point in a period of my life i did everything with violence, it didnt work either it was worse. I was desperate to find a way so i had to tried everything but nothing work. (Im sorry if this incoherent to read, at the moment im writing this and im  not in my good mind but i feel like being stuck in a prison & i need help.) Now im living with my mom & its still hell because shes nothing like my father but the fact that everytime shes hurting me, she gaslight me into thinking im the one whos wrong and it hurt me mentally. Im really contemplating the suicide but idk what way it wouldnt hurt, even tho im asking people no one wanna really answer, beside that i have some friends who survived their attempts and from what they are saying its scaring me even more from trying. Before doing any hasty things i still wanna try to see others perspective on it so maybe i can find something that will help me. I already went to a psychologist it didnt help. I tried to talking to my mom, shes using the same sentence over and over again at some point i stopped believing them, ik when im doing a bad thing and i apologize, im doing it for real which mean i aint doing that ever again. Not for her, shes using it like a jail-free card everytime & i cant do shit. I can just take the consequences of her actions for the rest of my life until she died, i dont wanna keep living in this hell. This probably look like a crazy rambling and its probably is. Please dont say keep living life is beatiful or whatever shit that doesnt help, give me concret solutions im so desperate pls.",

      "selftext": "I developed an anxiety disorder in college (GAD and health anxiety) and at age 26 I went on Lexapro, which I was on for over 18 years. I had a decent life during that time although anxiety was always a part of it. \nThe last 2 years have been rough, and Lexapro didn't seem to be doing much anymore. I tried 2 other meds (Zoloft and Prozac) but stopped when they made things worse.\n \nIt's been 6 months since I stopped all SSRIs.\n \nBut here's the thing - I didn't have depression before, but I have no energy or desire to do much of anythingnow. I feel fatigued to the point where it's like I have a bad hangover every day, and nothing I do make a it better. I have upper neck aches and tinnitus and aches in my extremities. All my bloodwork is normal, and I'm waiting on an MRI but this is brutal. \n\nThe only thing that makes me anxious is when I feel lousy, but I've been able to keep myself from freaking out and it still doesn't go away. I struggle to focus on important things, I'm super irritable all the time, and everything I need to do is met with the thought of \"can't someone else do it\" and \"when will this be over\" even though I know I don't feel better when it is.\n\nI can't shake the idea that something is wrong with me medically. I don't think I'm dying, and my body is mostly OK, but every day is a struggle to be mentally present and not want to zone out and give up as soon as I have to go anywhere or do anything.\n\nDoctors keep passing the buck, and I keep waiting for someone to actually solve my puzzle. And it's all too easy for them to prescribe something else but I'm not convinced it's just a mental disorder. \n\nIs this depression? ",

I’m almost 24, was the stereotypical gifted kid with top grades who everyone thought was gonna go somewhere. Ended up in university for a completely useless degree (my parents threatened to cut me off if I did an apprenticeship like I wanted and I couldn’t afford to be cut off at 18 during the height of Covid). Ended up suffering with depression during my degree and getting an awful result anyway so now it’s worse than useless. Since then I’ve been stuck in dead end retail/hospitality jobs that pay minimum and suck the life out of you. Now I also can’t move out of my parents house cause I can’t afford it and I’m stuck living with parents who barely tolerate me (I’m gay). \n\nI swear I’m not trying to seek pity or anything like that I literally am just open to any sort of guidance or if anyone’s been in a similar situation. I considered doing a conversion post graduate course but again… low bachelors grade and I can’t afford it. Even if I did save up enough to scrape by on rent, I’d be all alone and at square one. My biggest issue is lack of job experience, I’ve applied to hundreds of jobs, I tailor my resume, I write cover letters and most don’t even give me the time of day. The ones that do are same old. It’s also a struggle comparing myself to friends who are succeeding and going forward with their lives and careers. I feel embarrassed. \n\nNot to sound dramatic but I see literally no point and no way forward. I’ve been trying for over a year to get myself out of this situation but I end up feeling empty pretty much every day and if this is my life then I truly don’t want it. I also cannot turn to my parents for help or advice as they are also low income and honestly never show support when something positive comes my way so it just drains even more. \n\nAnyway rant over, not even sure what I’m expecting from this but at least it was a way to get things out and force myself to articulate what I’m feeling cause it’s eating me up at the moment.

And then there are way bigger scarier things appearing before me when I raise my head.\n\nThey say I am reliable, because I always manage. If I do, why doesnt it ever get easier? The years pass and everyday I hope for just a bit of peace. A little time to calm my anxious soul. It has never worked out and I feel like it never will.\n\nI dont want anyone in my life. I just want to be left alone. And yet im so incredibly and painfully lonely. I know im not ok but I bite every hand that tries to feed me.\n\nI am trying my best to get out of this spiral. I really am. Hopefully one day I will understand myself better.",

It's kinda pathetic I guess, but this is the only place I can kind of confess my feelings without feeling extremely anxious. \n\nI often catch myself daydreaming about the end. I keep thinking it over and over. It's so weird. I'm so afraid of dying, but living is just as bad. I get sk anxious about everything. Overthinking so much. It feels like I'm in the deep water and everywhere I look it's just more of the same, deep, dark uncertainty and it makes my stomach so thight because there is no way out. And it doesn't matter what I do because there is no solution. Just to give up.\n\nSorry, didn't mean to sound so ... awful. Chatting with people used to help. But I can't even tell people how I feel, because I don't want them to think that I'm this pathetic, weak and immature. I feel so stupid. Like, why am I even writing this stuff. It's not going to change anything. Just get some pity from people and insults from others.\n\nHope your day will be better than mine.",

Back to the so called pretending life and all that. To even bad thoughts. \n\nI talked about it with my therapist but im a very hard person to look into, so all progress is on the slower side.

I was extremely lazy yet I breezed through high school easily. I’m a month into college and I’m done with my life. First of all the people here are older than me, more experienced and can put in crazy effort. Multiple hours consistently everyday and I just can’t do that. I can’t focus. I’ve been skipping classes and behind on assignments already. I can’t do what I’ve been doing through high school. More than that I think that I don’t want to be a doctor. I just chose to do medical because it sounded cool, I never really had a genuine interest in anything, doctor, engineer or anything else. Being a doctor means you have to study for 10 to 15 years with very hectic work hours and terrible pay for the starting years. I can’t last a month. What the fuck am I even doing here? I’m sick of life, addicted to my phone, rotting in my room all day, can’t go outside, incapable of making any meaningful friends. No one understands me. I just can’t, I can’t take 15 more years of this. I know people out there have much much worse situations but that’s an invalid argument, I am not those other people, this is my situation and I don’t have the mental strength to deal with this. \nIve been in depression for the last week, I have not left my room for a week and have not attended classes. Life is fucking pointless, we all go to the same place in the end. God is not real, and death is equal. Life is unfair, so what’s the point, just get it over with instead of just suffering. No one will care, so I’m done. I have a little brother who’s doing well, so my family will be fine. I don’t want to get help, there’s no point, I dont have something for which I can live for, I’m done, I’m done, I’m done, I’m done, I’m Fucking done. I’ve done plenty research for the past few weeks on Suicide methods, I’ll kill myself soon and probably make it look like an accident. I just hope my death would have some impact. I thought it would be stupid to end it without taking in any input at all so I’m posting this. I’m sorry if I came out as obnoxious but I’m done with everything.",

However I've always been a lazy person. No psychologist can change that, and yes I did go to one as well. So dont advice me that. And dont post memes either, I like unemployment memes but Im asking for an actual useful advice this time. I hate waking up in the morning. The entire idea of having to wake up tomorrow early gives me severe anxiety. I also know that we are all going to die and I find it hilarious to work boring jobs and get all tired doing something everyone does just to die at the end anyway. I will never change my lazyness. Or is there a way? I highly doubt it. And what is the meaning of my life if it equals to that of an animal?",

I'm very privileged and nothing has happened in my life that I could be depressed from, but my friends seem to think there's something mentally wrong with me. I don't think my mental health has ever been the greatest because I've been comparing myself to my siblings from a very young age. I just always feel like I'm not good enough. This has manifested itself trough my insecurities and just like generally hating myself.\n\nI think it was like 3-4 years ago (I don't really remember it that well) when I just started kind of closing myself in or idk I just knew something was wrong and then suddenly there was more bad days than good days... I don't think it helped that my grandpa killed himself in 2023. (I also just realized I forgot his full name, like wtf, did my brain really think that was unimportant lol:,)) I don't know when my suicidal thoughts started cause I don't remember much from that year but I know that a guy in my school jumped out the third floor of our school in an attempt to kill himself and I told my friend that at least we know what not to do now, because I just made a note for myself how much it traumatized basically everyone (I also added another note, to not say all my thoughts out loud since my friend looked at me weird :)).\n\nA lot of things happened from 2023 to now, some more important some less, I probably don't even remember most of the since life was a blur at that point. I started eating basically nothing in September 2024 for a while but my parents were too nosy so I dropped it for now, I probably just start again when I have the option. In like November (I guess idk) I started self harming a little then I stopped for some time and started again in the summer this year rn I'm self harming pretty much every day. Suicidal thoughts never leave my head, yay! I'm basically lying to everyone so that's also fun. I know someone will probably tell me I'm supposed to talk to my friends or something, but like even if I wanted to how am I supposed to tell them I've been lying to them, and also they would just overreact like a lot...\n\nHonestly I'm probably exaggerating none of these \"problems\" I've described are really that serious to be called depression, and if you think they are I probably just said it wrong :)\n\nPS English is my second language so please forgive me for all the mistakes I made",

It also showed when I had my final exam, things like that usually drive me crazy, but this time I felt indiffrently about it.\n\n\\-> Another thing I noticed was that I would start to procrastinate on tasks and work I had to do, which I almost never did before.\n\n\\-> One aspect that has also botherd me for quiet some months now is that I more and more worry about death. What happens after death? Do I spend enough time with the ones I care about? I randomly start to think that the people I love could die and that their will be a time when I will have heard their voice for the last time and spoke to them for one last time. It sometimes keeps me up at night thinking about it. (I never had those thoughts before)\n\nSo at this point I would like to thank everyone who took the time and had the paitience to read the post, I also would polietly ask for your forgivness for any errors in spelling or grammar since English is not my native language.\n\nTo anyone who graciously writes a reply, I want to offer my sincere gratitude.\n\n  \nKind regards and may god bless you.",

      "selftext": "Hey, I'm kind of new to this subreddit and it has helped me alot. I just wanted to say how unlucky I am and it feels like god hates me. I was born and then my dad died like 2 years later, that was one reason I think he hates me. Then my mom went to jail and I had to go to foster care. I went to many houses and they all were abusive, at one point, i accidently gained DPDR and I still live with it. A couple years later I went to a different house; my aunts. Then as was at their house it felt perfect, but then so many irrelevant, small things kept missing me off, like losing my wallet, phone dying at worst time, getting a virus, and being flat-out targetted in video games. I used to have fun, but now everything is so boring and sad. I have also gained VSS and I'm in a major depression right now and I always have anxiety. I tried talking to god to help, and even tried going to church. Last time we tried going to church to see my grandpa speak a speech, we were following him and he is old so he cant hear his phone, so when we were following him we got pulled over. It feels like god GENUINELY hates me. Please, if you have advice tell me.",

      "selftext": "I don't really know how to start this so here we go I guess\n\nFor the past year I have done nothing but sit at home, playing videogames and watching YouTube/anime for the most part. Although I live with my family, my 2 younger brothers and mum, I don't have any friends and they are pretty much the only people I talk to.\n\nAfter graduating school it has felt like there is no direction for me to go in, but it's also something more than that, just a deep feeling that I haven't really been able to identify. It feels like a mixture of sadness, loneliness, regret, burnout and self hatred. I despise who I am and I want to grow and get out of this hellhole of a mindset. Every time I feel like wanting to do something productive I sit in my chair and go back to my video or game, everyday is basically the same.\n\nRecently there have been some improvements, I have been going out a bit more, and I'm getting pushed along in trying to find employment and do things in my life by some government program and I'm going to tafe next year, although I'm scared I won't even have the knowledge or drive to actually even pass it or do well. I have just fell into this hole of escapism, trying to flee from my responsibilities. \n\nI've recently been watching some evangelion retrospectives on the themes of the show and I really feel like I relate to shinji in his desire for escapism, although not in the same way as me, I don't think I have the desire to be praised specifically.\n\nBut I do feel this need to have someone else there. Even though I desperately want a relationship with someone I'm not willing to put in the work to go and find one. Maybe it's all the bullshit I went through in school, I don't want to go through the whole story but just to summarise my experience with other people so far I have never had many friends growing up, usually it was only 1 or even 0. During highschool things seemed to be looking up, I found a big group of friends during my first year but I quickly screwed that up and by my 3rd I had been kicked out, during  my 4th I found 2 others who chose to hang out with me but after that year we split up. During the final 2 I was completely alone, I just gave up on trying to be friends with anyone. \n\nAlso just a small side note everything I've been seeing in the news lately has been pretty shit so that's a real bummer, but I know I'll persevere so while it might be a contributing factor I don't think it plays a major role in what I'm going through rn. All I know is that if I don't change something in the next few months, that is get a job and start studying for tafe, I am going to fail. \n\nI've just allowed all these years of loneliness to get inside my head and eat away at me. The thing is, as to bring this all back around, I don't know what the hell I'm going to do about it, I don't know how to describe my feelings to other people, it's all just such a big mess I don't know where I would even start. I also don't know what I'm doing here, how the hell is anyone here going to help me especially as im writing this down in the middle of the night when I should be getting to sleep, as I have to get up early in the morning or maybe  should just stay up all night again because I know I'm going to oversleep my alarms or even I do wake up I'm just going to fall back asleep.

I started a new job which makes me work opposing hours in comparison to my friends, they all work a 9-5, I’m an emt, my schedule changes drastically and I’m  usually working nights. So I’ve been disconnected. \n\nThey’ve said it’s been like this even before I took my job, saying I’ve been like this for nearly 2 years due to a drastic change in my life (college ending, leaving a relationship, moving back home) but I thought I recovered, apparently not. \n\nI’ve been looking at old pictures / videos of myself and have started to notice a change in my eyes, which I think is the biggest indication. \n\nI’m unsure of what to do, I stopped going to therapy a while ago because I really thought I had everything figured out. \n\nJust looking to vent/ look for advice I’m really unsure on how to tackle this",

I certainly do, and I was bad before life started to get real, had kind of an episode long ago, then I got better, then covid started, got worse, then I kinda lost half my family to random stuff, lost an uncle to lung cancer since he smoked like 20 ciggies a day, then another uncle to a heart attack, then my cousin took her own life after decades of bsttling depression, all in the span of like, months between these events wich started august last year and culminated in february of this year when my papa lost his fight to cancer as well, he got diagnosed in october so it happened way too fast, so yeah, this is the hardest life's ever been for me, my brother is away so I'm alone with my mother, I lost my job, and a aunt of mine just passed away recently also to cancer, she fought for years tho... just wanted to like, share it I guess, good thing I don't have boolets :)",

My wife took our daughter and put me out. I don’t blame her. I was a terrible person. And good lord that woman did everything for me. She was the type of wife every man prays for. But I couldn’t stop the drugs. We went our separate ways and I finally came to my senses and got clean. I still smoke a little thc from time to time but I quit the hard stuff. It’s been two years since I’ve used a hard drug. October 7, 2023 to be exact. Since then I have gone to rehab and tried getting my life in order. I miss my daughter. It’s coming up on two years since I’ve seen or heard from her. And I understand why my ex is so hesitant. I was a terrible person. But now i sit and ask myself if it’s even worth it. When I was using I had it all, literally. Married to a beautiful woman that birthed our amazing daughter. I had a great job, nice vehicle, we had our own place. It was everything people dream of having. Except I had the drug problem behind closed doors. So for her it was hell. But since I’ve got clean, life is shit. I don’t miss the high at all. But damn everything goes wrong. I wrecked my truck(completely sober), I sleep on my sisters couch and that times running out since my niece is about to give birth. My current car is broke down which is making getting to work impossible. I don’t have any money saved up because I spiraled after my divorce. I don’t have any family. Mom passed two years ago. It’s like the earth is just crushing me. I feel like there is no getting better at this point. I was hoping typing this would help but it’s just a bunch a crap run-on sentences that don’t make sense. Sorry for anyone that reads this crap. I’m just lost and I feel there is only one way out. ",

      "selftext": "Well the thing is i don't know where to start. I dont feel good rn i thought maybe some specialists/people with experience could share some knowledge. Its not really about the school but that is like the thing i am unable to do because of the, and again it depends, most times when i think about why am i unable to do that, (sorry for orthography errors btw or if the sentences are very long like this) is also when i think that there must be more to life than this so you get it im like in need for something better and asking myself bro i literally am forgoting my point rn. I feel like even writing this might be helping me out when im so stressed because i tend to close up in myslef with my thoughts a lot for like past 5 years prob or so, im in last year of high school rn btw. I used to have decent elementary school life pretty decent but i know there were some like a bit weird things i dont remember at that time too like i heard from my sister that i used to close myself in a bathroom and yell or something i have no idea why was that but anyway it was good. The thing is that when i started to need my father more he rly wasnt there didnt teach me much about how life works as far as i remember he was always negative about everything i never liked him much beside some times we spend together nice but its another thing, its the same with my mother that sometimes shes nice sometimes shes saying something like i wish you didn't have 18birthday so you could go on vacations alone or something worse. The worse things were with my sis prob really but it hitted me hard too especially when my sis told me like the things that were happening to her so for example my father molested when he got drunk after she got raped also after she got raped my mom called her a whore also there were some things that she was telling her that she can go to the psychiatric hospital and kill herself in there when she was in a rage i dont know how much of this i remember i remember i heard quite few of these tho. Also my room used to be like next to my parents thats like little thing too when i heard them talking or laughing or whatever late i was afraid that my father was beating my mother for some reason idk it was kinda scary i used to be scared with like some monsters for bad behavior when i was little but thats relatively common and i dont think it affected me like very much. The pretty big thing i am afraid of thinking is like memore of my father trying to kill himself in a living room and i saw it when i was like idk 11 i guess something around that prob not more so i even forgot that later but my sister brought it up later idk why she did maybe its better maybe its not i kind of got used to this memory now anyway. Also it was like then now they are not that much borderline insane hopefully but they are still mostly my father 90 percent him like quite few times hes behaving normally recently a bit more often but still 70 percent hes just annoying and i cant listen to him hes just saying all the negative things or talking about people dying or idk its so bad nvm this. The point is I just want some emotional support of all of this crazy shit thats on my head idk whats going on sometimes i am so overwhelmed all the time because they cant just stop doing it, thats their lifestyle, noone freaking normal in here all the time my grandpa calling me 5 times a day to come to him if i dont come he says i dont love him and its better if we just let him die and he goes around the neighborhood and tells everyone how bad he is even tho my uncle and aunt and young cousin who are living with him were always trying to live with him nice but he always knows everything better, he wants to control them and hes like so out of mind when it comes to politics he lives with it and says the world gonna end, and for me he thinks he can buy me prob i hope not idk like giving me money for comming to him i mean its not what the grandparents do like give little money for candy thats other thing anyway everyone is crazy here even tho maybe they try to be kind good and they are sometimes actually i got to this point of madness that i cant see it because when i try to think normally not just to be in my mind not to need to listen to all of this, because listening to the worst depressing things about other people and themselfs doesnt help me with living with them and like other factors too like i used to be bullied a bit in the beginning of this high school and i got super fixed on this point like what did i do wrong and everything and then losing out a lot of hair my hairline doesnt exist i look worse and all of these things compared just arent easy to analyze in a healthy way its so messy that escaping here and dropping the high school or even when i got so into it in my head like thinking about all of this at once, killing myself, though i prob wouldn't do that. And it doesnt help with feeling the moment and feeling the moment is kinda the thing i need and it would help me with getting closer with people in my school. I just want to be healthy. When i sometimes feel that normalness, calmness its only for a very short time and i instantly start crying why did i fuck it up so much or something. I mean maybe thats not my fault but its not my parents fault fully either idk at least i don't wanna blame them for everything because i hate it but they are nice sometimes. My mum especially feels like she cares about me but i aint feeling much at this point tbh, i got a bit fixed about getting dopamine previously too. A lot of pc, the online lessons during covid probably didn't help either. I wish i was ready for the high school more could get a lot of nice friendships in there and always have some support or at least someone i really like at home and feel like the vibe with him. Now i will be prob going to my grandpa because he started calling everyone whats going on with me because i didnt answer his phone calls when i was on a party with my friends and he knew that btw, and the parties happen like once a 3 months more or less. I want to get myself better somehow i dont think escaping is smart but staying here is so difficult mentally i would need to get on some meds idk. I dont wanna be on meds tho i wanna be normal like without taking drugs",

I want to be gone forever.\nBut I love my mom so much. I want to have a dinner together with my family like old times. They are miles away from me and I can't afford to go back, not now. I can't go without having to spend my last days with them, but I can't live either. ",

      "selftext": "Hello! \nI was wondering if anyone felt like living (as a whole) is a tiring thing? \n\nI recently turned 18 (female) and I am one month into college, and I always have this moments each year since I was 13 where for a long period of time (5 months or so) I feel like I want to disappear? I have never went to a therapist or been diagnosed anything.\n\nNothing gets me excited or happy anymore, whether it’s birthdays, holidays or anything. I feel hollow and anxious all the time. It’s the first time I post about this because this year has been specifically bad. My mental health gets reflected on my physical, I feel ugly sometimes and just useless and a failure?\n\nI always excused it as me just being lazy and not wanting to do the most basic things (like showering or getting out of bed or eating, I know it sounds gross I’m sorry) but I feel like it’s not laziness anymore.\nThe mere fact of laying in bed feels exhausting, breathing is exhausting, sitting up is exhausting, studying, opening the blinds, taking out the trash, speaking, taking notes, dressing up…I don’t know what to do anymore? \n\nI have cried more this past month than I have ever did in my life, my eyes burn when I see light and I just want to end it all, \nis it selfish :( ?\n\nI don’t see any point on doing anything? My parents notice and I have cried in front of them several times (which is fricking embarrassing, cause I thought I would never do that)\n\nI told my mom that maybe I should see the university therapist but she didn’t really like that. (She is a very loving mom, but I see the worry and fear in her eyes and I don’t wanna disappoint her)\n\nI feel kind of ashamed because I don’t have a hard life?They work so hard and I feel ungrateful. I go to a good uni, have some friends, my parents like me and they support me. The thing that has been gotten affected are my grades. \nDoing work (I know this is gonna sound stupid but bare with me) scares me because I think that I am gonna fail while I do it so then I just don’t do it? But then that means I don’t practise which means I get worse grades but I am terrified of trying to solve a problem and just not getting it, like it happens to me in class.\n\nI know it’s stupid but I don’t know what to do :(\n\nI tried reading the content before class and asking questions during the session, but when I am in class I don’t understand it anyway? Maybe I’m just stupid? The information just doesn’t get into my head and my mental health is on the lowest (I hope it can’t go lower than this)\n\nNormally I deal with this on my own (which means I don’t really do anything about it because I don’t know how to act on it?) But this month has been the first time I have EVER called a hotline (which is something I never thought I would) for anxiety and depression and just overall “not wanting to exist” thing?\n\nI thought this feeling would go away like it always does, but it’s been 7 months and I’m desperate. Is this depression or am I just overreacting?\n\nI know strangers can’t do anything, but does anyone know what’s wrong with me? Is there medicine I can use? Pills I can take? Is this how depression feels like? I don’t know what’s is wrong with me :( \nI don’t wanna seem childish or make you guys seem like I am a crybaby  but does anyone know a hint of anything from reading this post? ",

      "selftext": "Dear guys,\n\nI'm 17 years old now, having Asian parents and feeling exhausted. If you guys read it, please give me some advices, I don't know how to deal anything now. Thank you very much.\n\nI used to dream to go to the USA, studying uni there, having career, and becoming success. I used to dream that I will become a mathematical professor. I tried doing Math a lots. I passed the entrance test to get to the better school in my region. In there, I faded as I had nothing special. No special ability, no \"the flash\" problem-solving skills, no ability to stay over night for stuyding. I just became a particle in a huge elements. I tried to get a slot in olympic team, I lost 4 times every year. Each year, I just needed to gain 1 more point to get enough point. However, I failed. Then, I failed in English certification, IELTS, SAT, ... I had nothing without being hard-working everyday. My classmates were test leaked by other teachers, which just prevented me from touching anything. The strong just became stronger, the weaker just became weaker. And I am just a normal person in an environment of the strong.\n\nLater, my parents, who are very harsh, signed for me the program to get to USA uni (\\~$10k). At first, they believed me lots from the consultant who said that they would get me into top 50th uni. They spent lots of money. Observing my consecutive failure, they rejected me and adviced me the 200th uni. At first, my parents just criticized those consultants. Then, they heard from my relatives that going to Can, becoming a nursing assitant will have a brighter future than going to current US. They signed me that program although they knew that I won't like it, even a bit. Many pressure were made, they always talked about the benefit of the jobs, every day, every meals, and every time before I went to sleep. I just wanted to say: \"F\\*ck off\". I'm too tired, they talked too much, I could not handle anything. The Can program required me to study biology. I had to balance the time going to school between studying an additional program at home. \n\nThose days, I just wanted to sleep, I had to woke up at 4 A.M just to meet the online teacher. I'm too tired. I just wanted to sleep. Then, they required me to do housework, which I had begin to do since I was 6. I'm just wanted to take a rest. My school took me nearly an hour to get there. Traffic jams, test, and homework made me feel exhausted. They drained all my energy. I just told my mum that my family use too much bowls and plates for a meal. I only used a plate and a spoon while other using excessively more than that. I'm recommended that they should used less. However, what I got after that was a furious, rude, and disrespect reply from both of them everyday, every time I met them. I just wondered that why I deserved that. \n\nSometimes, staying in the toilet, I just want to ended everything. Nevertheless, I'm a boy, I have to stay strong. But when I got any faults, I would get the most rude and furious talk from 2 nearest people in my life. I don't have any friends to talk with. In that school, everything like a war, I had to be very careful in every relationship. Going home, hoping peace, and I received these. I knew I have to reach my dream. But it's too hard - an onerous task? Those people just wanted me to satisfy their dream, being bombastic with other parents. I knew it, but I could not do anything. I don't have money, I don't have a job, and I don't have a home. \n\nSometimes, leaving is enough, but it's too hard. I cannot do anything by myself. If I received help from those people, I just received the worst treatment. I hate everything, I wished I did not exist. I knew I am strong enough that I can handle everything living in this family. But this strong could not stay longer, it was slightly broken everyday. I felt alone, I don't have anyone who I can talk in the most real way. I had to lie to everyone that I am fine. I knew I was cooked. \n\nI don't know how to deal with it, somebody, please help me, even a bit. Thank you.",

      "title": "Just a rant",
      "selftext": "I'm... I'm still fairly young, 'haven't seen the world or anything much yet' young. I'm depressed. Severely. Always. \n\nHow it started: \nI don't remember being suicidal, craving to hurt myself, or finding myself repulsive at a young age. I would say... I was a spoiled brat, I have a house, food to eat, tuition to go to, in general, I had things. I remembered being cheerful. My mom abused me when I was young. Violent punishments, loud screaming, bone-chilling threats; Hot water, a clothes hanger, a chair. I first felt anger, fear, and sadness from her. You would think typically a child's first emotions would come from the surroundings. Etc: anger from not being able to buy a toy, fear from getting lost in a crowd, or sadness from a passed loved one. I started becoming quiet, afraid, always on the edge. Then the bullying starts because of my physical looks. But I do know, my mom was a huge percentage of my depression. Violent tenancies aside, she loves my siblings more (I'm the youngest), they would always come first, their perspective would matter. How they would get things when I don't, how when both me and my siblings talk, she only listens to them. I heard more 'I won't be wasting my energy being upset at you now if you weren't born.' than 'i love you.' My brother used to laugh and joke how he 'flew down from heaven' while I 'crawled up from hell' and everyone would laugh. \n\nShit went down:\n...When I was... 13...? I started self harming. It felt right, it felt necessary. It felt good. Like the hurt I was feeling wasn't justified, but if I cut open my skin, it would show that I was hurting. It would help me get some attention, maybe someone might stop hurting me to help me, was my thoughts. I planned my suicide to be at 16, such a pity I'm still alive now. I still remembered laughing and crying a little in class when there was a activity to write a letter to your future self. The teachers would give back the letter after you graduate from school. People was writing congratulations on graduation, hopes to get into a certain school, maybe even a love letter. I was writing my will. 'You did well.' 'If someone else is reading this, it means I did it.' 'I would be proud of you, it's going to be all ok. You did what you needed to.' I thought it would be really nice if someone would read the letter instead of me. \n\nI didn't get help. No one noticed, the cuts was too faint. She noticed though. She saw the pictures I took to keep track of how many cuts I made everyday. She threatened to cut me, make it easier for me, cut deeper for me. I got scared. But I still did it. She found out again. This time, she took the penknife and slashed at my thigh. It left a really bloody wound. We didn't go to a medical clinic or anything, a gaping hole held together with antibiotic cream and cotton pads expected to heal by itself under a school uniform. I stopped afterwards, I was too afraid that she would proceed with my face next. For me, I felt that once I finally pick up the courage to cut, and if I stop, I wouldn't dare cut again. And I would jump straight to suicide instead of the temporary relief of cutting. Holding a penknife is really tough actually. The action of doing it isn't, it's the slashing part. To see and feel myself being cut open, even me hurting myself, to brace for the impact everyday every 30 mins or so.\n\nI tried to get help. Counselling, professional help centres, it wasn't useful. And I refused to have my personal infomation labelled with 'depression and suicidal.' Actually till now, I'm not sure if I'm suicidal or just oversensitive. Just dramatic, victimizing myself. \n\n\nAll in all:\nI envy other people. Families, \"You're irreplaceable in your family's heart.\"\nI'm unwanted by mine. I live like a tenant to them. I feel bad for eating food they offer to me, I thanked them like they were giving money to a begger. She still asks me why I'm so unhappy in life. I don't find the energy to reply her anymore. Or when I do, I try to stand for myself, and I get kicked down again. \nI just want to be someone important to them. Without pain or punishment. Or guilt. ",

I would just be better as a memory, then they can remember the best parts and I wont have to be such a financial and emotional burden on everyone. Im exhausting. I work at a grocery store for less than I was making at my last job which also wasnt great, but at least i knew people there. I had friends, and I just disappeared. I only have my associates and I might not be able to go to school like I wanted because I missed the financial aid deadline. Im just so done with everything. I try to read and write and play music to feel better but nothing helps. Every decision I've made in my life was a mistake and eats me. I got a car loan I cant pay back, I stopped being active in my last serious relationship, I didnt go back to school, I moved up here. Ive wrecked 2 cars and my current car is adequately garbage but it runs. Until I inevitably make another mistake on the road. Living with family stresses me out every day. My ex is long since moved on and im stuck in the past. I have no direction, no purpose. People used to tell me how bright my future would be, how I'd be a great person. I feel the opposite I feel like a total fuckup. I still have explosive anger problems and then get into deep lows. I just want my life to be over. Ive wanted that for so long and it just feels like the right time. I dont think it will get better for me. Ill never meet anyone better. I just drink a lot to distract. I hate myself so much. I know people like a lot about me but I dont think that looks or smarts or kindness is worth it thats dime a dozen in other people and its wasted on me. Im a waste of the gift of life. Ill never be better. Fun fact I was born with the cord around my neck, Ive been trying to take myself out since I was born. I don't deserve happiness. Ill just waste it, like everything I do.

      "selftext": "Hello, (I’m French sorry if my English is bad) I am depressed since 5 years and i got an anxiety disorder. I had some better periods in my life but for a year it’s catastrophic. I don’t want to tell all my life but to summarise. I lost my friend group, I lost my girlfriend and nothing was pleasant except doing drugs. I started to do amphetamines alone ≈ every week or 2 weeks. It’s feel like I’m capable of everything during 2 days and after, when I imagined myself taking my life back in hand, there’s nothing I can do except sleep and be sad in my bed without talking to anybody. This summer I went to a psychiatrist clinic for weaning and treating my depression. I went out since one month and, while I thought I was cured, I completely relapsed. Starting to do nothing again and I took speed again after three months of sobriety. The down was absolutely horrible. Last week I was taken to hospital because I eat 56 pills of Zoloft (I’m not sure about why i did that, i felt just horrible all days). There, I told myself that I wanted to get out of it once and for all. But once returned at home, it was just impossible to do things, when I was really motivated. So now, I didn’t believe in my own capacities. I want but I can’t and it’s terrifying me. Yesterday I felt really depressed and I ordered 2g of 3mmc and 1g of coke. Actually under the influence, I want sincerely stop my bullshit and start to leave a good life. I want that more than everything but I know I think like that because of stimulants and the past prove me that every time I said that to myself I was failing and started to be unhappy again without being able to do anything. I’m afraid of this actually, I fear about the terrible down. And I’m terrified at the idea that I can’t, even if I want, do the things to get better. Do you think this time it’s could be different ? Do you think I can do it and surpass my fuc*ing problems that are ruining my life ? I need some advices and suggestions of people who knows the terrible trap of stimulants and mental disorders. I take every advice from you and thank you in advance. I really want to escape from this rotten life, i’m just afraid of my own will is insufficient and restarting the terrible cycle again.",

I have been an incredibely high preformer, getting the highest grades and even got a scholarship to a private school, but ever since I started that school I realised no one wanted to be my friend and I became severely depressed. My school work became a burden to me and I lost all motivation. I would have panic attacks everyday. Flashforward a few months later I got medicated and am doing a bit better now, but still dread school so much. I don't care what anyone says. THERE IS NOTHING ETHICAL IN PUTTING TEENAGERS (ESPECIALLY MENTALLY ILL ONES) IN A HORID, USELESS EDUCATION SYSTEM THAT FORCES YOU TO SIT AT DESKS ALL DAY AND THEN COME HOME AND DO A SHIT TON OF STUDYING). At my school, that is the only way you can succeed. Study study study non stop. There is nothing in my life that makes me happy and I don't know how I still find it in me to get up for school each day and pretend I don't want to end it. I just broke down crying and screaming at my mum because I told her I can't study for a circular functions, cosmology, and english essay a day before. I procrastinated most of the cosmology study, maybe that's my fault. BUT I'M SORRY THAT I WAN'T COME HOME AND RELAX AFTER BEING HIGHLY OVERSTIMULATED THE WHOLE DAY AT SCHOOL. I tried hard for math, even got a tutor, but I'm still struggling. My mom is my favourite person but she keeps telling me I have to stay in school or I will end up nothing. I know she's right. She feels bad for me, but cares too much to watch me throw my life away. I just cannot do this anymore. I don't know how I'm going to do my final two years. I hate school with a passion. I just want to cry and sleep right now.",

Ive been going to the doctors for years but they can never fix my problems. They offer daunting waitlists fot help, quick drug fixes for depression and no help at all for an issue less than an emergency \n\nin the last 12 months my confidence in people and society has totally collapsed. I feel like I have been left on my own to deal with the worst reality despite trying to be morally running a tight ship so to speak\n\nI actually just realized that people just dont want to see depression, they dont want to hear it and they dont want to horrible experience, theyd rather you suffer alone and in silence, because ultimately it makes people sad to see others sad, so its better for them not to see that person at all, ever \n\nso my life collapsed as everyone stepped away, or I pushed them away and then didnt have any desire to help, or felt they couldnt\n\nNow I cant do anything.. I hate everything to the point that leaving where I live is a small success for the day\n\nsoon I will run out of money, but I cant bring myself to do anything at all.. i have no reason for living, for existing or for cotinuing.. it constantly feels like its OVER and its been this way almost for a year now\n\n...

I need money to set everything up so I can die (not even paif euthanasia) its fucked\n\nMy lifes over and I dont know what to do because theres no way forward and no real way to end it without fucking everyone over",

I’ve been in multiple abusive relationships in my life and never saw a good example of a healthy relationship as my mom also was. i feel like im going to end up being a deadbeat in my life, i can’t attend college since i don’t have my ged i frequently think about what could of been if i had a better support system, i would love to study childhood psychology but it nearly feels impossible even tho deep down i know it’s not. i’m sorry for the rant i just feel so lost in life ",

      "selftext": "I'm a 32 year old male. I've been dealing with reoccurring MDD (major depressive disorder) since I was 12. I've been fighting for 20 years to keep my life. I've been in a very bad episode the last year or two. I've gone through a lot of therapy/hospital stays thoughout my life and recently. CBT works the best for me. The most frustrating part is that when you go deep enough into therapy it comes down to \"you just gotta do it\" despite every cell in my body fighting against what I \"should\" be doing.\n\nI was independent and on my own for almost 10 years but my mental health tanked and my parents let me move back with them. I'm blessed with loving parents. It has been very hard as an adult to move back but I wouldn't have survived otherwise. They haven't expressed it but it has been hard on them supporting me. I've kept myself going by not wanting my parents to have to stand over my coffin. Unfortunately, their lives are finite. I'm embarrassed and ashamed that I can't take care of my family at this age but it is what it is. I'm just trying to live. \n\nI have lived and worked all kinds of jobs. Most of them highly skilled blue collar jobs. There is always a shallow sense of accomplishment when i complete a task but i never feel \"fufilled\" or have a sense of purpose (even though ive done very obscure specialized work.) I'm alive but I'm not living. I come in and out of good and bad times but I never feel like I belong. I never feel like I have passion or purpose.\n\nHow do you find a purpose/passion other than just staying alive? \n\n",

So, when I'm depressed, it feels like a rational reaction to my life.\n\nBut I've realized that's not the whole story. My depression is a product of my brain. The proof is that sometimes, for no reason, the depression lifts. I feel light. I can think clearly. I can laugh at a video and it's a real laugh. But here's the terrifying part: **Nothing has changed.** My bills are still overdue. I'm still alone. The reasons for my depression are all still there, completely unchanged. I feel clear and normal. But nothing in my life has actually changed. All my problems are still there.\n\nThis is what frightens me. It means my brain is lying during both the good moments and the bad ones.\n\nI had this proven when I took a medication for an unrelated condition. It sent me into a severe depression.  truly dark depressive episode of my life. It was absolute hell. I stopped the medication, and within a few days, the suffocating depression was gone. It was like a switch was flipped.\n\nThat experience confirmed it for me. My brain is unreliable. So now, when I have a good day, I'm not just relieved. I'm afraid. It shows me what my life could be like if my brain was wired differently, and that's a painful thing to see.\n\nDoes anyone else feel this way? The okay days just remind you that you're trapped by your own mind.",

      "selftext": "I just want to dump this somewhere. Lately, I've just feeling this intense pressure in my head, like a vein is about to burst. I've been having depressive episodes for past 5 years, but it usually cycles between high and lows regularly, so I could cope with it. I've never figured or accepted the depression I think (I would get really sad and low for no apparent reason and then I would happy for the same). An episode would last 2 weeks - 3 months as I've observed.\n\nBut lately, everything just feels shit. On the top of that,  I feel like I've got some bad luck cause I'm always getting bad news. I have (very) few friends but I don't feel like ever  talking to them, they are in their own world and it feels suffocating to hang out or talk atleast. I think I've got ADHD and I'm hyperactive, so I can't concentrate on anything and I'm always jumping between things, always restless, wanting to do something but I've got nothing meaningful to do. And from last week, almost like a chant, a thought to kms has been circling in my head. I know I don't have the guts to pull it off. But every night, when I'm at my lowest, especially when I'm about to sleep, this thought just keeps repeating, and I'm constantly thinking on what'll happen after it. It almost seems like a ploy to get some emotion out of me, to get me to cry (and I badly want to cry, I can feel my jaw aching and tears stuck behind my eyes, but I can't). So, much anxious thoughts playing in almost a loop and I can't shut it off. I started penning down these in a half poetry form, which I started to kind of enjoy, but I don't know anymore. This just keeps piling up over and over, and I'm afraid one day, something really insignificant might push me over. I want to find help in people, but I really don't feel like holding a conversation with anyone. I'm pushing everyone (including my parents) away.\n\nAtleast in real life, (I don't have much friends, very few and most of my connections are in a different place) I've been able to mask all this. But last night some minor thing (accident) happened and I've started losing grip on myself. I've tried screaming or releasing some tension someway. My roommate noticed a bit and that kind of scared me. Also, last time I called up my parents, I could see my attitude kind of showing out my depression so I don't want to let them know that.\n\nI don't but lately I've listening to so much Linkin Park, finding myself relate to Chester Bennington's scde. It's a thing I usually do, but the amount of time I'm listening to it sickening. Almost like I'm replacing the kms thoughts with Chester's scream 😅.\n\nIf someone could give some insight into any of these, how keep thoughts undercontrol, whether writing down these thoughts is helpful or no, how much of these is actually made up by myself. I don't know what I'm looking for honestly. But I wanted to put these thoughts out of my head.",

      "selftext": "For the entire four years of highschool, I was entirely isolated and friendless. But isolation felt addicting. I was never really sad about being isolated. I had depressive feelings sometimes - self hate - but it was nothing new to me, nor was it very severe. I had depressive feelings since I was 9, so it was basically my natural state anyways. Everyone knew me as some quiet weird kid but I mostly avoided bullying because of other classmates (from my old school) stepping up and telling me how I was “cool” (used to have friends and was funny). At times, I did feel “loneliness” but it was more of me being an empty and hollow husk rather than a tight feeling.\n\nBut now, as I enter my freshman year of college and I did make some effort to talk to people. I pushed through my stutters and conversed/hung out with a few people during the welcome week events. I talked to people at the dining hall and somehow, managed to have normal conversations where I didn’t show off any weird habits. I finally feel as if I could converse with people normally - but now I have the problem of being unable to talk to them as friends. I have the power of awkward small talk and sometimes, 1-on-1 academic conversations when the professor mandates it. But I can’t really make jokes anymore. I feel like I’m pretty bland. I don’t know how to make myself more enjoyable to others. Thus, I still persist in having zero friends. But now, rather than a hollow husk - I feel a tight feeling. I now long for connection and I actually feel my depression being directed towards a lack of it. Even the most basic crumb of attention turns me obsessive and I start maladaptive daydreaming for hours about scenarios where I am much more charismatic than I actually am. I think even my suicidal ideations worsened? Or rather, a strange new feeling about it developed. Because during a run (I began a running routine), I walked over to a fenced high bridge and felt fear. I was imagining myself dying. Normally, I’d feel nothing and wouldn’t imagine anything. It was such a weird feeling and I can’t adequately describe it in words. It was obvious to me at the time that I wasn’t going to do it. But it was like my mind treated it as if I was going to do it.\n",

I can't run forever, but if I stop, I fall eternally, I will be dragged to the depths of a place so far from the things I need that it will force my submission. I can't run forever, I can't simply stop. I need to leave to exit this hell, the everlasting hell I have found myself in. I need to take the concious choice to stop running and simply recuse myself from my waking hells, to so far beyond it all that maybe, I can finally find the peace I've wanted all along.",

But for some reason I just have a terrible time being alone. I don't know if it's because now I have no distractions and I'm just with myself and my own mind or what. But I get so depressed and I end up just texting my bf all day basically ruining his alone time because I just can't be alone without wanting to kill myself. I just don't know what to do, I don't even feel like doing hobbies or school work I just lay in bed and scroll on my phone. I did it all day today and deleted scrolling apps so maybe that'll help. I just wish I had some sort of motivation or I wasn't so negative and do or die all the time. I just don't want to ruin my relationship or end up failing my classes since it's so hard to focus on assignments. Any advice?",

      "selftext": "I (20M) am at my limit. \n\nI've been depressed since I was 11 or so. First something small, just numb emotions and stuff. I had a bad period or two, but I pulled through.\n\nI've always been pretty aware of my own problems. Therapy hardly helped me because I already knew most of my problems and the reason behind them.\n\nI've lost (probably unconsciously blocked) most of my childhood memories. So pretty much all the life I remember going through has been this gray, no-purpose flat line. Thing that should make me happy didn't make me budge at all, things that should make me angry would disappear quickly even when I intentionally tried to hold onto the feeling.\n\nI've been at ease with the idea of dead for many years. Suicidal ideation was pretty much normal through many periods of my life. In all honesty, the only things keeping me away from commiting to it is the fear of pain and not wanting to hurt my mother with my actions. I know the guilt would kill her.\n\nI kept going thinking \"Maybe things will get better at some point if I keep going\". I really wanted to believe it. But then it hit me. I got a few things I've \"wanted\" for years, but once I had those things in front of me... I felt nothing. It was alright, but I wasn't happy, there was no feeling or reward or anything like that. Not even relief. \n\nThen it hit me. I don't want to life like that. I can't. So I went back to therapy and looked for psychiatric help after some pretty ugly experiences. For a month, I managed to push through, things seemed to improve, I got prescribed anxiolytics and antidepressants. But that messed me up badly. I recently noticed, after oversleeping and being too tired to get up and take my pills, that I felt slightly better when I didn't take the antidepressants. So I found myself trying to quit them, and it helped a bit. I'm pretty sure my psychiatrist will recommend me changing prescription anyways (Currently on Vortioxetine, in case it's relevant).\n\nThat coupled up with college getting specially rough, my sleep schedule coming undone, either sleeping all day or nothing at all, feeling exhausted all day long without break, and isolating myself even further, as if I wasn't feeling lonely to begin with.\n\nI don't know anymore. My mother is there, she tries to help, even if sometimes it backfires. Therapy hardly does anything, and meds are fucking me up instead of helping. I'm probably in the worse depressive episode in my whole life as of now, and I'm genuinely clueless about how to get out of here. The constant feeling of despair, hopelessness and fatigue is making me miss the emotional numbness.\n\nI learned how to suppress emotions to an extent, my environment through most my life required me to be exactly what they needed, so I turned out pretty much like an empty just with no dreams, likes or hopes whatsoever. I've been taught I must do things right no matter what, and it turned into me being a control freak who feels responsible for anything bad that happens to myself because \"it's my life, I control it, if I'm here, it's because I messed up on the way to now\". Of course I know most things are just my head being a piece of shit with myself, but despite rationally understanding it, I just can't make it change, my head is rooted with that, with always managing everything myself and making things work out one way or another.\n\nI'm not even sure why I'm here if I'm honest. I don't even know if I just want to rant, to seek help, to find someone to talk and not feel lonely or what the hell I am even doing. My feelings were so detached from myself to be functional most of my life that I don't even know how to handle then now that everything is drowning me, and I can't allow myself to just collapse since college won't wait for me to wallow and cry in self pity. Though I hope I could cry, I haven't been able to shed tears for years now.",

I have to pay my rent on the 16th and I was already late, I don’t have any more time and I don’t have anyone or any way I can borrow money. I’m only missing about half of it. It’s actually been hard to find anyone that can help, I’ve even offered paying them back double within the timespan of 3-4 weeks. There’s nothing good going on my life and it seems to jsut be getting harder and harder. Now I’m about to be homeless? I think I will end it all either tonight or tomorrow. ",

It feels like I was led on if he was hoping for a change that he never communicated. I asked him if he was serious about us and I told him before if he’s not serious he needs to leave me alone. He reassured me he is just to up and leave like this.\n\nI didn’t handle it well. When he gets distant I get clingy and he sees my clinging as disrespect while I see his distance as emotional neglect. Before the breakup He went 6 days without texting me and randomly posted himself on a luxury boat on his social media and I asked him how many girls were on that boat with him. He didn’t answer and then we started fighting cause he viewed my story but still didn’t answer my question.\n\nIdk so much could’ve been solved by basic communication. It feels like he just gave up on us. We had so many dreams together. \n\nThe last time a bf dumped me I had to get hospitalized because I was very close to ending it all and self harming. This time I’ve just been isolating and trying not to feel at all. But I’m scared that I let another person decide my will to live. \n\nI’m tired of being both too much and not enough at the same time. I’m tired of feeling bullied and belittled by the people who are supposed to love me. I’m tired of feeling so alone.",

I trained, I took the ASVAB and went to MEPS making it to Category 1, but and months later of finishing up the medical work; I finally got a hard no and can't get a waiver. This was my only plan. I was all in. I did everything I could, and my entire plan for life hinged on this. This was the only way I could have ever have made myself into someone who actually mattered, and I gave everything I had, but that's utterly impossible now. I'm not sure what to do now. I'm not even able to find another life path; soldiers my age are on their second terms, and there's nothing I could do to make up for all these years or the experiences I would have had.

I weigh the pros and cons of sticking around and disappearing and the only thing keeping me here is knowing Mom and dad would be sad. \n\nI find little joy in my most passionate hobbies. I no longer eat without having to be constantly reminded to. My weight has gone from 180 lbs this past May to 137 as of a couple hours ago and I'm 6'1\". Every night I fall asleep wishing I could change all the things I despise about myself, staring at the ceiling wondering what's wrong with me and why I always end up being abandoned; then I fall asleep. \n\nI want to believe I can get better or just \"grow out of\" this but it's just not realistic. I'm not sure when I'll go but I know how I will, and at 21 I don't see myself making it to 30. I can't speak for others but I know at least for myself that it does not get better. I'm here until I can't be here anymore; it's just a matter of waiting. \n\nI wish I could be happier on my own. If that were the case I wouldn't be feeling nearly this bad; nevertheless I'm not someone who was built to lack companionship. I do better in life when I have someone to make the journey with. I do better when I have someone to show love to. I have all the love in the world to give and no one to give it to. The times where I feel somewhat okay are what allow me to be more like my naturally extroverted self, but the lack of connection and repeated abandonment actively keep that from happening. I have maybe three online acquaintances, and zero friends, and I don't remember having one that wasn't short-lived. I haven't been hugged in a very long time.\n\nWhat do I even do? Is there any way to make it easier to come to terms with being alone? How do I drown out the voices that perpetuate mean things about me? What is there left for me to do to keep myself from finally disappearing?\n\n",

I’m lucky if I get out of my pajamas. I’ve lost a lot throughout this transition. I break down multiple times a day and feel beyond isolated. I slowly feel my brain is shutting down, I use to love reading and now I can hardly stay focused. I know my mental state is not well and frankly there are days where I would be okay with not seeing the sunrise. The only reason I find any will to stay on this earth is my mother. My brother doesn’t even talk to her since he is preoccupied with his social life and partying. My mother is getting older and I’m afraid how she would be without having me- she’s very well off financially, but I worry about her mental state. I am just tired of practicing how to smile in front of the mirror. I truly feel like I have nothing in store for me anymore, all my aspirations have died. ",

I smile briefly and just after drop back into my head again. Or just stare at nothing while empty. My medication works, but it’s been just absolutely horrible recently.

Obviously a lot has changed since I was diagnosed but it genuinely feels like I will never get better. I eat well, exercise, meditate, journal, go to therapy, take medications and herbal supplements, and so many other things and feel worse after doing any of it. I am not excited or happy about 99.99 percent of my current life or the future and the few things that do make me happy I cannot do due to financial limitations or do not have time.  Anytime I do feel happy it lasts anywhere from an hour to at max three days. Yet I try. EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. and I only get worse. I guess im just posting because I'm hoping some others feel the same way....",

By \"really wierd \" the only way I can describe it is depression but my family thinks I'm being dramatic. I constantly feel disassociated, I lost all my friends because of constant drama in our friend group that fell apart last year, i cant even seem to make new ones because the thought of it seems so demeaning and my social anxiety goes through the roof when i talk about doing it. I have a new job that seems to add more stress than good, and all I want to do is just sleep and bedrot. I've been doing some thinking and I honestly think I'm only happy when I'm alone or can do my own things, I don't know how to even explain half of this but i just constantly feel like I have no willpower to do anything anymore other than bingewatch series. I went through a similar thing a few years back when i was a teenager but thought it was pubery ngl. The thing that sucks is that i know i have a pretty decent life, im surrounded by loved ones but i dont know why im constantly feeling like this. Does anyone else feel like this or am I going through a wierd patch?? Any feedback would be helpful...thanks!",

I've had mainly straight As with a handful of B's (like 4) throughout all of high school. You can probably see where this is going.\n\nWhenever school starts, I feel like most students like me end up pushing away our personal and mental health problems and issues in favor of focusing on school. I've been doing this since the start of high school. And to be fair, I've always procrastinated but when the panic settled and deadlines came closer, I'd do my work and essentially lock in. But that hasn't happened yet as of this school year. And I honestly don't know when or even *if* it'll happen and that scares me.\n\nOn one hand, I'm terrified of the prospect of failing a class or getting low grades, on the other, I can't care. And that's terrifying for me. There's no more adrenaline that kicks in and forces me to work, no more panic when I see a deadline. If I care, it'll cause mild discomfort, but I'd otherwise forget and move one (not a bad strategy). The first marking period just ended. I'm screwed for two classes and I don't know what to do.\n\nI guess on top of that, since I'm American, we have the stress and pressure of colleges (bc the american school system is meh) and the SAT. I'm set to retake again in November but can't find the motivation to study.\n\nYeah. I guess now that I've written it all out, it is kind of coming to me how little I care and how much I hate that, but I can't seem to do anything about it.",

Now that he has started high school I am needed a little bit less and I’ve become super aware of just how isolated I am. I don’t have any other family besides him, work from home, and have had the same lack of friends that people commonly talk about on this sub. I thought I was doing the right thing by focussing on raising him but now I think that was a mistake and I should have done everything I could to get another partner into the family. The damage that isolation does to people is well known and I’ve even seen it destroy a few seniors once their connections pass away, the degradation follows a very predictable path. I can now clearly see I am on that path, but I’ll have a lot more time to live through than an elderly person. My hope is that I can keep operating at a normal level for my son until he is mid-twenties and I know he is set up and will be ok. After that I’ve now found myself thinking I might end it. There won’t be any retirement golden years for me. No travel with my partner etc. work for me has only been done to support the raising of my son so I have little interest in continuing when there isn’t any benefit. I don’t want to become like one of those elderly people I’ve known, and I would hate my son to see me go through that. My plan is to tell him my plans about 2 years ahead of time. So that we have time to understand things and come to terms with them. Almost life long solitude is not a recipe for anything good so this is now my retirement plan.",

I feel like all I’m good for anymore is letting my family down, disappointing all of them, and just ruining everything. It’s not fair to them to have to suffer because of me. ",

      "selftext": "(M23) One of the biggest lies ever told. Is that life is some kind of gift.\n\nFirst of all, gifts are free, and from the moment you are born your life isn't free. Your parents literally have to pay for your birth certificate. In some countries they even have to pay just to stay in the hospital. Did your parents give you good or bad genes? None of that is up to you, but now you'll have to live with the consequences. Maybe your healthy and attractive, that's good, that might seem like a gift. But what if you're not, what if you're born with health conditions that plague you your whole life, and a face you didn't ask for but now everyone will judge you for having.\n\nIs it still a gift then? Your parents might love you, or they might abuse you, who knows. But people who are born with great talents may have an ideal job they want. But they can only get that job by getting qualifications, first by doing well in High school first, which relies solely on them having a good memory. Then by passing College, some actually people get the job they want right out of the gate, but MOST people end up putting their dreams on the backburner, where they eventually shrivel & die.\n\nBecause now you're an adult, and you have the added stress of constant bills to pay. You have to conform, you need a job, especially if you're a man. Because you can't be loved if you don't have one. That's right your search for love and acceptance from another human being is directly tied to your finances. \"Isn't that Fantastic\" Anyway, I've made my point, life is not a gift, it's actually the textbook definition of a burden.",

My normal coping mechanisms aren't possible and there is no real option of trying to give myself hope by making plans - I either won't be able to do them, or I'll have significant anxiety that I won't be able to. \n\nI'm extra fatigued today and I've just had the sudden, dark moods come on. Passive ideation. I think triggered by my body being really unwell from PEM.\n\nTherapy hasn't really helped and I don't tolerate meds. So I just don't think there's an easy answer. \n\nRight now I'm having intrusive thoughts like, 'maybe you're not meant to survive; maybe that's why you're 37 and still single and have no kids and now you're sick you've got no chance of that happening now'.\n\nJust looking for some community I guess, or the very slight ease of writing this post. \n\nThanks all.",

      "selftext": "I (14f) have completely fucked myself in life and only realized once it was too late. I have no skills or hobbies and it’s too late to actually be good at something. I think a lot of this comes from the fact that I was given screens far too soon and it ruined me. (Don’t give your kids screens it will do so much damage trust me I had to learn the hard way.) But I also think part of it is my adhd and possible autism, because I’ve been diagnosed and I’ve always had certain oddities to me in truth. I’ve picked up things over the years but I’m lazy and I always quit and then I hate myself for it. I’ve wasted the most fundamental years of my life and now I don’t have enough actual experiences or memories. I have no friends at my school and I’m not gonna get into a good collage because I have shit grades and I’m not a part of anything really. I have this black hole inside me and my life has been consumed by trying to determine whether I was born with it or developed it because of my shitty decisions. I hate the fact that everyone around me is better off than me and I have no one to blame but myself. My parents are normal and stuff and they tried to set me on the right track but I completely failed and I don’t think I can fix it now. I don’t want to have to live with the regret. I have this desperate notion that if I kill myself I can start my life over and do it right this time. I know thats not necessarily a way of thinking that’s encouraged but every time someone says I can’t change the past it kills me more and more I can’t go on like this. I have a therapist and my mom wants me to take Prozac but I know I only need it because of my own failures. She’s also mad because I’ve started purging and I’ve contemplated sh. One time after she fell asleep I even snuck down into the kitchen and drank white claw because I wanted to forget everything. I could’ve had a great life but I already managed to ruin it. The friends I do have already figured out dating and makeup and socializing and all that stuff but of course I’m still the fuck up. No guy has ever liked me and I don’t think anyone will. At least not someone who isn’t a loser. My cousin was talking to me and she said I need to lower the bar for myself if I want to be happy. Fuck my life. Please please please I need to fix this I can’t live with this there’s no hope. I could have been so much more than this but I ruined it. I get so angry all the time and I have so much shame in me that I worry that if I don’t hurt myself I’ll end up hurting other people because the dam is breaking down I don’t know how much longer I can contain this. There has to be something better out there I can’t handle here. Even if it does get better somehow I can’t live with having ever been this person and not being able to change it. I don’t understand how all the people who’ve made terrible decisions in the past can live with themselves. Even if it faded away I’d still want to die. Day and night I dream about being able to change my fate. God the things I would have done differently. I don’t know what anyone can say to me that I haven’t heard already because nothing really helps at this point. Just shouting into the void ig.",

I just waste time playing games on the computer or watching YouTube. I never feel like trying anything new; I'm so tired and fed up with life. I try new things every now and then, but it gets boring very quickly, and I can't keep up.\n\nI'll be starting a job soon, but even earning money is no fun because I have nothing I want to do; I'll just earn money to feed myself and get ahead.\n\nAll I want is to sleep and never wake up.",

      "selftext": "This is really really serious and really bad. \n\nI have a close friend (we’re both over 18) who’s been in a really dark place for a long time now at least 6 months, maybe more. He still lives at home with his parents, and I’m close with them too. They’re worried sick but feel helpless, and honestly, so do I.\n\nHe’s suicidal. He’s talked about wanting to committing and building up the courage to do it, he’s been violent (punching walls), stopped taking his meds, stopped seeing his therapist. He’s drinking every night, isolating from literally everyone. He doesn’t talk to his family at all even though they live in the same house. He’s cut off all his friends, including me. He ignores my messages, won’t pick up the phone, nothing. If someone sees him at the house, he just keeps his head down and walks away. He also lies about everything.\n\nHe leaves late at night, doesn’t say where he’s going. We think he might be drinking and driving, possibly using something too. It’s getting really scary.\n\nToday I went over to his house uninvited. I know it was a risk, but I didn’t know what else to do. His parents were home and told me he was upstairs, so I went up and knocked on his door. No response. I texted him saying I wasn’t doing great either and just wanted to sit with someone. I told him we didn’t have to talk we could just watch TV in silence. I just didn’t want to be alone, and I didn’t want him to feel alone either. (For context, I’ve also been struggling mentally, and my boyfriend my usual support is out of town.)\n\nStill no response. Eventually his brother came upstairs and just opened the door I wasn’t expecting it, it was so sudden and then I just saw him for the first time in so long he looked thin and pale. My friend was in bed I think pretending to sleep. I said “Hey,” and he said “Hi.” I told him I wasn’t doing well and just needed someone. This is weird but he just said “I’m fine. I saw your boyfriend yesterday.” (He didn’t my boyfriend’s been gone for a while. And I didn’t even ask him how he was doing because I didn’t want to trigger him that why I said  “I” and not doing well. His response was so odd).\n\nHe said he had to go to work in 30 minutes, but I know for a fact he doesn’t work today. I asked if I could sit with him until he “left” and he just said, “No, I’m sorry, I really want to go back to bed before I go to work.” I asked if he was upset with me or if I had done something wrong, and he said no, just that he’d been really busy (he hasn’t been). He sounded irritated by the end so I said okay, left, and went home.\n\nNow I feel horrible. I feel like maybe I crossed a boundary or made things worse. I just didn’t want him to feel alone. I’m genuinely scared that he might end his life. He’s drinking constantly, isolating, not taking meds, acting angry and disconnected, and he’s been like this for a long time now. I don’t know how to help anymore. His family doesn’t either.\n\nIf you’ve been through this either as the one who was struggling or someone trying to help please tell me what helped. What did you need? What should I do? I feel like I’m running out of time scared that it could happen any day now. And now we cannot admit him he lies puts up a front will pretend he’s okay they’ll only hold him 72 hours that’s not enough to help him. ",

      "selftext": "I have struggled with my mental health ever since I can remember but at the age of 10 I started to self harm. Very quickly that turned into an addiction that lasted for years but about 2 and a half years ago I managed to end it. The thing that got me to stop it was a very toxic online relationship that I finally ended a couple of months ago.\n\n Around the same time I had met my current boyfriend and we started dating a month ago. He is absolutely lovely and I have nothing bad to say about him or our relationship but because of other reasons in my life my mental health has been declining again. I'm not even sure why but a bit after we started dating I relapsed on SH. At that point we had been dating for such a short time he hadn't seen that part of my body yet. When he saw the scars he asked me when I did it but I panicked and told him I did it before we started dating. He believed me but he looked extremely sad and told me to \"promise to never do it again\" and I told him I wouldn't. I managed to go a while without doing it and after that he asked me in multiple occasions again to promise I wouldn't do it.\n\n I did end up relapsing again tho multiple times but he hasn't seen yet and I'm scared to tell him. He is on a trip currently so he won't be able to see them for a while but I know they won't be able to heal to the same point before he will see them + I also did it in another spot last time. He has also struggles with mental health and I'm scared he will be absolutely heart broken once he founds out. I think the addiction has come back because it's all I can think of but I feel so guilty for it because I fear my boyfriend will think it's his fault even tho he is actually most of the reason I don't do it more. \n\nOnce tho I joked about how his mom had said I look \"mentally unstable\" and that I kinda agree with her but my boyfriend got angry at me for calling myself that and started telling me \"you are completely fine \" and \"you don't need fixing\". I know he meant that in the best way possible but this was after he had found about my first relapse. I'm not sure why but SH for me sometimes is reassurance that my struggles are valid and him telling me that triggered me to SH later that day even tho he had again made me promise I would never do it again.\n\nThe guilt about it is making me feel even worse and I don't know what I should do or say once he founds out or should I tell him before he sees them. I also don't know how to tell him that telling me that \"i'm fine\" when I'm actually not triggers me. Please if anyone has any advice on what I should do I would highly appreciate it.

I don’t want to leave on my own hands but I … I just wouldn’t mind if a car would run over me or something similar. I don’t enjoy life anymore and I can’t help myself. I tried to tell some of my friends and the only reply ever was: tell me if you know what you need\nBut that’s not what I need. I don’t know what I need. I need people to help me, to offer me to make a little plan or just someone to talk to. I feel so lonely and helpless. Everyone around me is so busy with their own lives and their own problems and that’s absolutely okay but I… I just need someone, anyone to talk to",

      "selftext": "Hi, I'm currently looking to receive a formal diagnosis for OCD, depression, and potentially other mental health conditions, but I’m unsure which route is most appropriate for my situation.\n\nFor context: I’m 34 and lived in South America until the age of 29. During that time, I was diagnosed at different points by various professionals with depression, borderline personality disorder, and ADHD. Although I engaged in some therapy and took medication briefly, I never fully committed to addressing my mental health.\n\nAfter moving to Europe 5 years ago, my condition worsened significantly. I’ve had multiple crises, including a period where my life was at risk. This led to a brief stay at a psychiatric hospital, where I was advised to explore the possibility of OCD.\n\nNow, I’m fully committed to taking my mental health seriously, and I recognize that the first step is obtaining a clear, formal diagnosis from a qualified professional so I can begin the appropriate treatment.\n\nAt this stage, I’ve contacted both a clinical psychologist and a psychiatrist, and here’s what I understand:\n\n* A psychological assessment is more in-depth, typically spread over 8 sessions, and costs around €850 (not covered by my insurance).\n* A psychiatric assessment is shorter, usually taking 3–4 sessions, costs approximately €40 in total, and is covered by my insurance.\n\nI’m leaning toward the psychiatric route due to the lower cost and the possibility of quicker access to treatment, including medication if needed. However, I want to ensure I’m not overlooking the benefits of a more comprehensive psychological evaluation.\n\nGiven my personal history and current condition, would you say there is a significant advantage to choosing one type of assessment over the other?\n\nThanks a lot!",

      "selftext": "Recently, I’ve been really struggling with my mental health because someone left me. It’s taken such a hard toll on me. I was always the type of person who could move on easily, and I don’t think I ever really loved other people. I think I just tolerated them because there’s something wrong with me, I can’t create real bonds. It’s like I know they’re there, and I know I should feel something for them, so I try, but I can’t maintain it. I want to love people so much, but I don’t feel genuine love for anyone except this one person.\n\nI met them about nine or ten months ago at my job. They were so sweet and goofy, and they made me feel safe, which was rare for me. We became friends first, and after seven or eight months, we got closer until we started dating in September. I knew they were a bit reserved, but I figured that would go away. For the first time, I could really feel something. I felt love I think. I think they actually wanted to be around me, and I loved every second with them. We laughed so much. It was perfect.\n\nBut I think they were talking to someone else, maybe even in love with someone else, because they left me so abruptly just a month later. They left me like I meant nothing, like everything we went through meant nothing. Now I have no closure, no explanation, nothing.\n\nI’ve had to seek emergency psychiatric help because I’m afraid of myself. I’m afraid of my brain. I’m afraid to go outside. I’m afraid to play games. I’m afraid I’ll see him. I want to see him, and I know that sounds wrong, which is why I’ve been avoiding everything, but I’ve had such a hard time coping.\n\nI feel like I need more help, but I don’t want to admit myself into a psychiatric ward. That’s always been one of my biggest fears, and I don’t know what to do because I feel like I’m losing my battle. I don’t know how to win. I know that if I don’t get help, I’ll never feel better. Right now, I feel so hopeless, like nothing I do is worth it. I just picked up my medicine, laid back down in my bed, and sobbed. I genuinely don't know what to do with myself.\n",

      "selftext": "Depression caused me to not care about my teeth but I decided to change that at 21 and I just want to make this post for anyone in the same situation to take control like I did. My teeth were still very healthy but they were becoming extremely yellow and lots of hard plaque would build up even after only a few months from the last cleaning because of how bad my brushing habits were I would maybe brush every like 3 days (for years straight) but at least I did everything like tongue scrape, floss, mouthwash etc. But I still wasn’t consistent and my yellow teeth made me very insecure I would avoid smiling and talk while barely opening my mouth. I also had 1 receding gum which is also part of the reason I stopped brushing because I was scared to make it worse, it cost me about $1k to get the gum graft done which was very important because root exposure can lead to tooth loss. After that went well I felt confident and I started taking my dental health seriously and I started using the crest 3D white two step whitening toothpaste and whitening strips along with a crest 3D white whitening mouthwash. My teeth were getting whiter and then came time for a proper cleaning and they became pearly whites, I’ve never felt confident in my smile and it felt so insanely good to actually get tf up and make a positive change in my life and this is now something I strongly care about and that’s the key to leaving depression you need something to care about or something that motivates you.

For the past few months every since I got back to town I have felt worse than ever. I love cats and they are a big part of my life but over the past 3 years each of the pets have been dying with one going missing. Before summer there were 2 cats left, my cat and a relatives cat and I loved them both very much. When the cat died I was crippled with sadness but I had people there to keep me up however as soon as I got back I started getting worse. My family has so many issues and I can't handle them. I have wanted to get away but I do not have the resources to, I've tried to get therapy but it takes time and resources. There is also my cat who is so important to me that I won't end anything until her own time comes. Meanwhile I will just try and hold on for her, she is on the older side so I do not know when she will go. I would talk to family but I think my deep rooted trauma from childhood has made it hard to be able to say anything and even when they try to get me to not shut off when sad and I try to say what I feel they do not realize that is what I am trying to do and make it hard to be open. With all the things in my life weighing me down it gets harder with my living situation, society currently, and me internally. I have a strong hunch I have ADHD as my parents have similar symptoms and this feels like it causes me to barely be able to get up and do things even before my depression like brushing my teeth. The only times I can are if I get really hyper fixated for a long time till I eventually burn out or if it depends on someone and what they think of me. I am also so scared of any of them finding out how poorly I am doing that I even keep to myself online. I have been depressed for so long and I am just left with my cat and the tiny amount of hope of things getting me better so I am just hanging on with my cat being the last thread keeping me up. I do not even know if this is breaking the rules and I just need all of this out of my throat as I have been keeping it within me for so long and I know that all of this does not make me special as many people go through various hells on earth. It hurts that even though I believe I can get better in a different situation, I won't be able to get close. I do not even know how personal this is, I just struggle talking about my emotions and do not want anybody talking to me about them face to face. I just hope I can get therapy and be able to talk. I am constantly getting hit with these waves even though I wanna do all sorts of things but I just can't get myself to do them or go through with these things cause my brain eventually wears out.",

All the answers to these questions will all be opinion. But if you think that life has truly no meaning and continuing to live is useless why do people think that you need help? Why waste your time on someone like that? Why try and help them? Are you that stuck with the idea that no one deserves death ? When death literally will happen no matter what. \"She was so young\" or \"she was so pretty\" death doesn't warn, does it? Not even when you're pretty. Do you only value human lives because they're like you? I know a lot of humans who can only feel empathy for humans. They're so stupid. Their idea of life is humans. They think humans are the only species that deserves to live. I physically and emotionally cannot care for a human more than an animal. I like animals more than humans. I saw a guy say \"we're at the top of the hierarchy\" are we? And who created that hierarchy by the way? Pears or Humans? We don't deserve life. I genuinely hate myself for being human, I hate others for being human. Don't get me wrong, I have empathy for humans too. I'm an empath. I feel empathy even when I don't want it, it is truly sickening. But the people who limit empathy to humans and still call themselves empath are truly low in my empathy hierarchy, they're not even on there actually, I forget that \"humans\" like that actually exist. I truly wish for them to cease existing. My question is now : what defines a human? Thanks ! ",

There have been periods of my life where I was severely depressed but I had something to fight for or look forward to and I found it easier to push myself.\n\nI was homeless in 2022 following an abusive relationship and having no family to fall back on because they were homeless as well. This was a truly dark period of my life and I was very depressed and suicidal but I found to see friends everyday and do something. \n\nNow, I know rationally, my life is a lot better. I am now living in a place with my partner who is not abusive at all and is actually incredible. I don't love my job but I have work and am better financially than I was before. I have two cats who I love. My bf has a dog. My parents are not homeless anymore.\n\nHowever, I am depressed and absolutely hopeless. I do not have anything to look forward to. I pick fights for no reason. I am terrified of my bf's dog for no realistic reason. I have no interest in contacting my friends. I don't do any of my hobbies anymore. All I think of is how much I feel trapped at home, how I am terrified my bf's dog will hurt my cats (my cats are the only beings that make me want to be alive right now), I am terrified of my bf's family, I am not close with my family. I feel horrible.\n\nI feel like this spouted from something I was fighting for not panning out. I was fighting to move from this area and job I am stuck in and it didn't work out. \n\nI feel like my bf's dog has been a big point of contention recently. My bf's dog got injured over the summer and was acting incredibly aggressively towards everyone in the household and I already had a fear of dogs before but it just got amplified. My bf and I had a huge fight while moving in and I know he talked to his mom about it and his mom now resents me despite being kind to my face. My bf considered rehoming his dog (I did not say anything about it at all) but his mom definitely thinks I am the one behind it and makes comments about \"dog haters being cruel and soulless people.\" I do not hate dogs at all and never wish harm but I am scared of many of them. My bf and his mom has made comments that people who can't handle dogs cannot handle children. This honestly broke me as I always wanted children but I realized maybe they are right and I am not ready. \n\nI just feel beat down by the only people I relied on in the past and I have no hope for my future.",

I want her to have the best life she can without worrying about my mental health or physical health or wellbeing because she doesn't deserve that stress. \n\ni legally cant start working until im 16 and I turn 16 in 2 months. i am not sure as to what to do now. get a job and save up so i can move out? but then id struggle with university because even though i have a lot of issues, outside of my home im a good student and i wanna get into the medical field. i hate this so much i feel so alone in the world like a stray dog but its my fault for having so much bite in the first place. i have no friends because im asocial and in a crowd i just freeze and quiet down. i have no one because no one wants to be with me because of how i act. i doubt if even staying alive is worth it when i do nothing for anyone and just burden people. i know im young but i dont wanna live a full life if all it entails is making life a living hell for everyone im close to. because if everyone i care for is at peace, so am i, even if i will be gone",

I understand that i did something wrong and now all I can do is study in the hope that they'll let me continue this uni after this year. But this situation has been awfully hard for me, someone who has been depressed and s/icidal for the past couple of years and had craved freedom and a normal life.  Yesterday, when i finally arrived home, I had a fight with my family and since i was so ashamed and overwhelmed for what had happened, i started slapping myself and scratching myself and screaming as a sort of punishment and they saw it. They started saying I was doing it to act like a victim and I was hysteric and they couldnt let me go back there if i had these reactions, since I can't handle myself and that they shouldve understood that when my old school therapist called them. They told me they're scared that i'll take my own life or self harm and that they will be called for that. So I asked to go see a therapist just to help and also because I know there's something wrong in me. i know it since i was younger. There are many things ive delt with that they do not know about. They told me that if im crazy and I need a therapist then i'll have to stay home and leave uni. \nSo umh. I feel that for the hundred time, they have not realised how bad ive suffered these past years and how a therapist is not only for crazy people who need to be locked somewhere. ",

I don’t live in the US where you can get a job underage to earn some money. \nMy mother exhibits all the symptoms of being emotionally immature, and she’s been through a lot, a disgustingly horrible divorce (abusive husband) + horrible in-laws + relatives that give their unsolicited input + parents that were emotionally abusive (not out of cruelty, but to discipline, this is also due to trans-generational trauma due to culture), so I have a lot of empathy for her. \n\nThe divorce was when I was 3, and I still visit my dad, who remarried 6 years later and has 4 kids, and both him and my stepmom are physically abusive and emotionally abusive towards their kids (not me because I ‘behave’, which is technically because my parents raised me right and my dad didn’t raise them right and treated them badly). And btw I’m currently making an effort (gathering evidence) to get my siblings out of their situation too, Im trying not to be a bystander.\n\nHer parents live with us and I notice they still exhibit emotionally abusive characteristics (without knowing they’re abusive) and that has affected my mother greatly, because she overcompensates all the time amongst other things, and they do not value her time and energy and effort enough in my opinion. And I feel they favour her brother more thta. Her even though I feel he’s less involved in their care as much as my mother is, she’s very undervalued and I think my grandmother has a slightly unhealthy attachment to her son.\n\nThis obviously translated into her becoming emotionally abusive, in the form of emotional immaturity, as well (she doesn’t realize it ofc) and it having its effects on me too. She doesn’t mean it, and didn’t expect me to become the way I am because of it, and frankly I don’t blame her for 99% of it (she still can change, I just can’t explain it to her without risking hurting her again) \n\nSo how do I deal with her despite her being emotionally immature, and do it with tact and kindness, because I can’t distance myself from her.\n\nEdit: please do not send me DM requests, I just want some advice, not a personal conversation",

They are the strongest. They live through hell every single day, every single minute, every single second. Yet, they somehow, face this world. they face this world alone, with literally no one , not even their own mind on their side. \nWho in their right mind will call such people weak???? They are the bravest souls on this planet. \n\nWhen I was a kid, I was happy, had the urge to explore and live the world.\nNow .... I exist.\n\n\n\n",

Everything I try to do to help is pointless, I try to date, have more friends, do anything but stay at home and nothing works, I always got this horrible pain in my chest when I’m alone and it’s been eating at me for as long I can remember. I’ve never been in a relationship, I was going to start a long distance one a few weeks ago but the guy asked to just be friends, and replaced me within the week with someone else long distance. \n\nI’m a big personality too, I’m loud, opinionated but always like to tell people the truth no matter how much it hurts and sometimes it just makes me feel like I burden everyone around me because of it. I’m just not worthy of anything good all I am is to be used and tossed to the side and I’m so sick and tired of it. I just want to disappear because at least then this constant ache will stop. \n\nI’m not sure what I’m doing posting here but its just me venting I guess, my entire dating background has just been strings of hookups because people look at me as a tall guy (I’m 6ft10) and just want to use me for sex which a few of them openly admitted after leading me on. \n\nEven my friends sometimes avoid me because I can just be too much for them, or I’m just not involved with many big group activities and it just fucking sucks, I don’t know why I’m here anymore and I guess this vent or ramble or desperate cry for help is something but I’m just done, I’m ready to go I’ve had enough of everything and I’m willing to bet like everything else I do this will be ignored.

In 7th grade I survived a school shooting and saw my classmate get shot and heard someone die and idk what I was expecting but my parents celebrated it saying how interesting it was that I was considered a \"primary target\" in one. Afterwards my cutting habits became so bad that when my left arm was covered in cuts I would just move onto my legs. My parents noticed my cuts after around 3 months of cutting and all they did about it was yell at me then tell me to not do it again. Before that I had some hope that they cared but afterwards I never told them anything about my life. I completely shut down even from my friends and every connection I made and this was when the pandemic started... Im now in college for engineering with no friends or anything just doing bare minimum. My relationship with my parents have gotten slightly better but I heard my dad talk about how sad it is that my cousin is going through some hard times (he took 1 year off college) and how he's really struggling and that my dad is gonna lend as much support as he can... idk.. I should celebrate the fact that my parents have become better people but at the same time I feel so much sadness for my younger self.

      "selftext": "This is our YouTube  page  we started  and didn't  get to continue  growing it.  We started  this a couple days after I got out of the hospital and  At the time I was stressing about responsibility,  leaving Mike's family and literally  everything to go a find our place but on our terms.  We had a very rough, stressed, draining year.   We just stared losing everything.  We couldn't find a place to live because I was not working  but had a nice chunck  of investments  that was more then enough to support  us and my fiancee is on probation and couldn't  pass the background  check.   This was also why We list my apartment.  Then we are had uhaul take the truck with my entire life and our home belongings, I mean everything I have ever had was in that truck. Fortunately He wasn't as impacted because he didn't have stuff like that  at the apartment so for him it wasn't as emotional.   Uhaul came and toed their truck one night and we still haven't received  a reason.  I called  the 800 number 20 minutes  after  so I noticed  it right away.  The lady said it was a mistake she saw the truck was paid up for 3 more days and in good standing  so she said just go in tomorrow  and they will take care of it.  Ha !  That opened a huge can of worms bit long story short the manager  did everything  to avoid us and she would  not let us get our stuff we tryed going to her manager calling corporate,  we finally  go a attorney  because absolutely  no one at uhaul would even to us where the stuff was and this would have been 4 months later now.  Anyway, we had some other things going on and just said f it .  It was too much . And we found out this particular  woman at this location  has made this mistake  and done this to atleast  4 other ppl .  We found that out by the reviews.  Then we moved in with his parents.  Thats all im going to say.  I was and still  am severely  depressed.   He couldn't  find work due to the  background  check. And he was trying  to keep it together and make me happy and make his parents  happy  who are wonderful  ppl but living there in your late 30s and being treated  like your still a kid in high school  was very wearing on him and me. I could stand the way we had no privacy.  His mom would just walk down and she would say coming down but if we were like oh hey o one sec , she just kept coming.  I was changing one day and completely  bare except my undies and she starts and I'm like oh sorry h\nJust one sec and she didn't stop I barely got that out and she is staring at me and goes oh its ok its just me.  Like um no, no its not ok. There were other things too but it almost broke us. And we have been thru alot  but living there was a huge strain.  So we left!  We got in the car and just drove off together  to find something  somewhere  but together.   We spent the summer at this beautiful  hotel but the first 3 weeks we stayed at truck stops and welcome centers not having a clue where we we e going  but we were just road tripping  it and it was great.  We slept,  ate,  has sex, and  everything  else 24 7 in that car. Except shower . We didn't bring a lot of clothes  so we had to Walmart it up and we finally showered at our first hotel  but we were ripe by then.  Point is, all of it was so fun and so silly we never fought  we never  got sick of each other and needed space and we love.  He was my everything, my world. He showed me such a powerful love that I cant explain.   He was so much better at being the calm one then me. Hes always positive,  wanting to go try and so smart and easy going. And I'm trying to make sure everything  is going  to be ok, and loud , obnoxious. I yell instead  of talk when I do get upset or excited and i guess it comes  off wrong for him. We grew up in very very different  ways so that's where are only issues stem from.  However, I thought I lost it all before.  Hes always say we still got each other.  We are right here together.   I never appreciated  it until  now.   I've lost everything! \nBut these videos are special  because he just glows, his personality  is larger then life and he's  so good hearted.  I feel so lucky to have been in his life and that he chose  me. My mental  health  issues,  my emotional outburst, my immaturity. All my flaws and he built me up everyday and gave me confidence  I haven't  had since I was  23.  Hes my safe place.  He knows how to calm me in seconds.  I could go on. Hes my world, my best friend, and my lover and hes gone ",

      "selftext": "In my 30s, stable job, enough money to pay bills, buy stuff I want and still have something left, family is mostly healthy and doing well.\n\nYet, I feel like shit.\n\nI dont hate my job, I even got a mention for my work two years ago. But I never felt excited to go there, either. And I also feel like everything I do is meaningless, it has no impact on people if I'm there or not. Thought about quitting and applying for a braindead job at a clinic or the fired deparment, something that matters. But this wouldn't pay the bills and what if it makes me even more unhappy than what I'm doing right now?\n\nNo social network. I life in this town for eight years and didn't make a single friend. I only talk to people online and they are all old friends I know for 10+ years. But even to them I talk less and less. Join a club? When I come home from work, I'm usually too tired to do anything else and I'm just happy not to talk to anyone. Same for weekends... I'm lonely but at the same time, being around people I don't know drains my energy. My hobbies are all so diverse and niche that it seems impossible to find someone who is interested in even two of them. And even when it comes to stuff like gaming and music I like this obsucre substream stuff that nobody ever heard about. My interests are also so shallow in every field that when I hear others talking about it, I feel like an outsider and don't want to engage.\n\nNothing is fun anymore. I used to play games all day and make music, multiple songs per year. Now games bore me after half an hour and I finished two songs in the last five years. Starting is hard, if I actually do start something it is fine, but most of the time, I just aimlessly browse the internet, visitng the same few pages hoping that something changed there in the 5 minutes since my last visit. When I do things I enjoyed in the past now, it feels more like an automatism and because I did them them back then and it was fun.\n\nNever had a GF and I know why: I never go out and never talk to girls. I don't consider myself ugly, but definitely below average. I'm not a good talker and not an interesting person. Also, see above.  \nGot rejected twice, happens. Then there was this girl I knew for years, I really liked her, we talked alot, I would have trusted my life to her. But she had BF, so didn't say anything. Then they broke up, still didn't say anything, thought it was to early. Visited her, planeed to tell her, did chicken out, sent her a message a few weeks later. She said she already had a new guy. Strangely I didn't feel anything, no sadness, no anger, just emptiness, like I asked her for a favour and she declined. We rarely talk since then and looking back at it, it was always me initiating a conversion and she just tagged along. Kinda feels like she never cared about me in the first place.  \nNow I have a new colleague at work for initial training. She is kind, smart, cute and we have somewhat of a common hobby. I barely know her but I keep thinking about her. She will be gone in two weeks and I probably wont see her again after that, so I feel kinda pressured into doing something. And while I'm thinking about what to do, there is this voice in the back of my head that keeps telling me she will reject me anyway, laugh at me, I'll be the creepy guy that hits on girls at his workplace and will be reported to HR. I also don't trust my feelings anymore and I'm not sure if my brains just tells to be interested in every female around my age that doesn't immediately raises five red flags.\n\nSo what to do?\n\nTherapy? I was at a clinic ten years ago and just when I thought I would finally start to make progress, they said we were done. Went to a nearby doctor five years ago, got some meds, he told me to come again for a check up. After sitting two hours in the waiting room, I wordlessly left and never came back. It feels like getting an appointment is extra hard for people with mental health problems and you have to wait six months at best. Waiting half a year just to meet someone you don't trust and start all over again? Sounds bad, so I never did it. I also feel that I'm not really in a position to ask for help since there are people that have it far worse than me. At least I can work and take care of myself (most of the time). It's not as bad during the day, but when I lie in bed, the bad thoughts come in like a flood. What should I tell the doc? \"I'm ok atm, but last evening was horrible!\" - \"Yeah that's what you said the last few times, why are you here again if you are alright now?\"  \nI love cats and read that animals can help with depression, so I got a cat once. It made everything worse, had a breakdown after a month and brought the cat back. Have a look at this guy, can't even take care of an animal. \n\nSuicide? Guns aren't available here, I hate pain so cutting my wrist or jumping of a roof is out of question. Was thinking about carbon monoxide poisoning, but not sure if I will do it correctly. My biggest fear is failling to kill myself and ending up in a situation were I'm not able to try it again because of a mental/physical disability caused by the first attempt. Have a look at this guy, can't even kill himself.\n\nI'm just functioning because not functioning is even harder.",

He began to lead me upstairs instead of to his food bowl, and straight to my bed. He jumped up and waited for me. When I laid down he slept with me through the entire night, not even getting up for breakfast.\n\nHe’s been doing this for days straight now. Laying on my chest. Making sure I come upstairs to bed. He’s been licking my scabs on my face from picking so much. ",

My life at school is falling apart because I’m becoming absent at school so much and I’m just so overly paranoid of what people are doing around me or possibly doing. I isolate myself in my bedroom 24 hours a day unless forced to and if I didn’t have to take my medicine in the morning I would sleep all day and all night just so I don’t have to face the world.\n\nI have genuinely developed some form of self hate that I can’t stand looking at myself in the mirror or photos anymore, and at lunch I’m covering my face one way or another because I feel like people are staring at me. I have had suicidal thoughts and have just thought what is even the point anymore? What do I have going for me? Nobody sees me for me, both my best friend s always calls me by a different name(someone else’s)and my family always addresses me by my sister’s name, never my own. It’s like I’m not my own person any more. I never will or have thought about actually going through with it though, because even though I stated I’m getting tired of them. I love my friends and family.\n\nWho should I go and see? I don’t want to be sent away somewhere, I’m only 16. I don’t want to talk to my family about it because I don’t want them to baby me. I need help, but who the hell should I see? I don’t even know what to do anymore. I lie awake at night trying to think of why the hell am I here and cry myself to sleep at night. It’s getting harder and harder to go on and I just need everything to get better. Please let me know any type of doctors or support groups that have helped you, I’m in desperate need of it. ",

I have been on medications since. However lately things were going much better, I finished my bachelor degree, and follow the dreams I had when I was younger, I moved to another country, got my master degree, continued my life. Everything was good until about a year ago, I started to have those thoughts again. I am struggling so much to coexist with the thoughts in my head. The people I have here around me would really not understand, they know that in my past I dealt with something, and they were nice about it, but cannot comprehend it themselves, so I am really keeping it hidden from everyone. I do not want to worry the people back at home, who are far away, and I do not have much support here. Pretending to be fine all the time is exhausting. I cannot sleep anymore, my thoughts will not let me. I am not ready to live what I went through 6 years ago, especially alone. I cannot access proper help, as the waiting times are about 10 months for just a psychiatrist visit here, and I really lack the means for any private therapy. I do not expect any reply to this message, but I feel so lonely, surrounded by people that really do not comprehend these issues, and I needed to “say” this to someone I guess…",

      "title": "\"You have to tell the people around you how you really are doing\"",
      "selftext": "I can't remember any period of time in my life where I was happy, or just content. My upbringing consisted of substance abuse, rape, both physical and verbal abuse, little to no food, no social life and pretty much been neglected by everyone my entire life.\n\nFor as long as I can remember I've been daydreaming of dying. Being in a car wreck, falling in the sea, falling of a cliff. Just anything so I wouldn't have to live. I thought things would get better when I got out of my childhood home, and sure in some ways it did. But not really. I have been in and out of therapy for many years, and every therapist tell me to be more open to my closest about how my mental state is. \"They care and they want to help, but you have to let them\", tried that and now everything feels worse.\n\nFor context I don't have any family members, but I have four friends I considered close. I can easily talk in past tense, how I used to have it. But never how things are right now. And when I have told them how I used to have it, they always ask me why I didn't tell them when it was happening. That they would have been there for me, and that I don't have to pretend to be better than I am.\n\nWhen I was hospitalized for suicidal tendencies six months ago I told them where I was and why. When I got discharged after a couple of weeks only two of them checked up on me. They are aware of how things are going, because I did try talking to them like my therapists have advised me to. But they always have something else going on. Or they pick up their phone and start scrolling while I'm talking about how I feel worse than ever. And then I noticed, before I was hospitalized they contacted me several times a week. Contact went both ways, both parties engaged in talk or tried to make plans to hang out. But ever since I was hospitalized I have been the only one reaching out, except for two times which was the same week I was discharged.\n\nI always knew I kinda was alone in this world. But now it's a heartbreaking reality. I don't have any family members. I don't have any kids. I don't have a partner. And the only friends I have doesn't care enough to answer me or listen to what I need to get off my chest.\n\nSo I'm alone, and I don't really see a point in trying anymore. I'm tired, I never asked for this life and I don't understand why I have to keep living when it doesn't really affect anyone. Yeah it's sad when you hear about someone dying, but if it isn't someone you care about personally you kind of forget about it straight after. That's how it's going to be when I die now. And even though I really think people who have a family, friends, partners or kids that have committed/tried really saw motivation in having them, knowing how it would directly affect their everyday lives, I always was jealous of that. But now I feel like it's liberating. I can't do this anymore, but at least I don't have to worry I'm going to ruin someone else's mental health by committing if I end up doing it.\n\nSorry for the long post, it's a few days until my next appointment and I needed to vent about this",

      "selftext": "To start, I lost my job of over a year and a half, 2 months ago. My only source of income gone. I’ve been struggling financially ever since. Some might say just get another job right? Around that same time my car started falling apart and I couldn’t drive it much. At this point my tags are expired and I don’t have insurance because I don’t have a job to pay for those things. I spent my last few paychecks on my rent and other bills, gas, electric, phone etc.\n\nSo I don’t know how to get a job without a form of transportation there. I can’t fix my car or pay for the insurance/tags because I don’t have money. I’m also a month and a half behind on rent. (Luckily they’ve been working with me) but at the end of this month is the end of my 1 year lease so I have to move out anyway. \n\nI was also letting my girlfriend of 4 months and her 2 kids stay with me while her electric was shut off and she was figuring that out. (She had lost her job before we started dating) I lost mine about 2-3 months in our relationship but she has a job now. Anyway while she stayed with me almost every night, 2 weeks ago from tonight i found out some shit and still stayed with her and then 1 week ago from today found out she was talking to another guy almost our whole relationship sending him certain types of pictures and all of that. \n\nI can’t leave my house because my tags are expired, no insurance, and car is falling apart anyway. No job / source of income. Lonely as fuck bc my girl doesn’t live with me anymore and found out she was unfaithful. All I do is sit inside my house doing nothing all day. I’ve applied for jobs ( I have 2 years sales experience.) but have no way to get to said jobs. I’m confident in my ability to actually get the job and do interviews. That’s not the problem. I haven’t been anxious in about 4 years maybe and i have a constant out of anxiety in my stomach all day. I haven’t a hard time sleeping. And I have no appetite and can barely eat anymore. (Probably a good thing bc I have no money for food anyway).\n\nIdk what to do anymore. Idk where to go at the end of this month. Just recently I had everything and everything was going perfectly. and everything crashed down so fast. I feel like I’m going insane. Idk if I came on here for advice or just to get this all out. Idk if anyone will see this or understand my pain or know what’s next for me. I just want someone to be genuine with me and say that itll all be okay and not to worry. \n\nIf anyone wants to help or has any questions feel free to ask. Thanks for listening.",

Anyway I have been struggling with commiting for years and have tried twice but couldn’t go through with it. Ive gone through alot of changes in the last year. The one person i really opened up to was my EX but we broke up in april and she badmouthed me to almost everyone to the point I feel extremely paranoid in public and that im gonna be harassed by her underlings. Its happened several times. But she told everyone everything about me even my secrets while I have done nothing to badmouth her and even defend her actions because us breaking up is my fault. So i take full responsibility and the regrets if what happened kills me. Sorry for the rant ANYWAY. I’m scared to tell my current GF about how badly i wanna die, i dont want her to feel like shes the only thing keeping me here. That would put her in a weird position and im scared she will leave me. Which really solidifies the fact ill really have nothing left. Any suggestions on how to tell her how ive been feeling?",

Just this year I've lost two aunts and my grandmother. Last summer I lost my last two uncles (they were brothers) and they passed 3 days apart. \n\nOver the last year or so I've come to the realization that I've seen a lot of death. What I've listed above is just the last decade. Fifteen years ago my family has nearly 40 members. Today, there are maybe 15 members alive. It feels like every year someone else I'm close to passes away. \n\nSome hurt more than others. One of my uncles who lived a hard life and we had our issues, was one of the worst experiences of my life. Having to be the only family member who was calm enough to actually call his time of death. I watched him take his last breath. \n\nWhat makes it worse is, none of them passed peacefully. They all suffered in some way which makes it harder. I could lie to myself and pretend they didn't but I know better. I don't think anyone in my family has ever had a peaceful death which is horrible. I wish they all went like you hear people describe - a calm peaceful release. \n\nThis is actually the first thing I've said about any of it in a long time. Aside from writing it here, I've only ever spoken about what happened with my uncle's last moments once, with a close friend. I know it's probably not healthy, but I can't afford therapy so, I just do my best not to think about it. And I was doing well until today when I sat down with my mom for a couple of hours to talk about my grandmother. Now I'm here. \n\nTLDR - Fuck Death and Fuck Disease. ",

Basically a woman I called my friend bit down hard during oral late last year and a couple months later, I don’t see how enjoying intimacy is ever going to be a thing again (Penis disfigured and painful with discharge, swollen part of a testicle, pelvic floor issues, permanent whole body issues from being poisoned by an antibiotic). I was never going to be serious with this woman but she’s what will make sure I can never be serious with anyone ever again.\n\nWho I (M26) was has been gutted to the core. An act that is supposed to provide great pleasure has left my life with pain deep in my soul. I don’t understand how someone ends up here. I can’t physiologically think the same way anymore after the poisoning. I wanted to get married happily one day and have kids that made me overflow with joy. I am left with a broken genital system and permanent issues from getting poisoned by a doctor mistreating what was going on. My future partners, my career, my social network, my self care, my youth, my prospects in life, my happiness, have all been greatly diminished because of this nonsensical, unnecessary moment in time.\n\nI have been in unforeseen agony stuck in my body for months now and will plague me for the rest of what’s left of my life. I want to find a solution and move on but I’m left so scarred and reduced. I miss my body and I miss my mind. I can’t stop thinking about the good times of before and what would have been and everything I am missing out on. I can’t even listen to music the same way. I should have completed my shit and married my ex, none of this was worth it, she cared and protected me. I should have done more with my life and did exactly what I wanted and worked for those things. I should have challenged myself and  used my good health everyday. What happened to that little boy who enjoyed sports and trains and thought about kissing girls one day? I’m someone’s son. My poor parents… How does one love when their love organ is so uncooperative, how do you fight your penis everyday for the rest of your life? I’m sorry to everyone here and what you’re going through, life is so cruel and sad for some of us.",

Then I’m dealing with a sibling who has catastrophic mental illness and they are non-compliant with meds (schizoaffective disorder) and so for them it also feels like they’ve died and the family is haunted by this tortured ghost.

I try talking to her all the time but then she takes forever to respond (which ig is ok cause she has dnd on for all the notifications she gets she needs it on) and when she does respond its usually dry and idk how to respond so i try making short talk and she just responds with dry things over and over, like “omg babe i just made this!” “Ooh yummy” have you esten today?” “Yeah chicken nuggets” “ooh yummy chicken nuggets are delicious” “yess” “soo what are you doing?” “Tv” “whatchu watching?” “This show my grandma turned on” “whats it about?” “Idk” and then she leaves, and then i just get sad and ask if she wants to call cause i miss her and she either says not rn, she cant, or she says in like 30 minutes. My problem is i always say the same conversations but i only make the same conversations cause idk how else to talk to her… itd be nice if i didnt have to start the conversations every day.. i just got off call with her and it started with her saying “ill call you in 20 minutes” and then in 20 minutes she called me and i fell asleep but then woke up and she said “are you trying to look sad for attention again?” And i was like “what no babe im tired” and she said “mhmmm.” (Period means shes mad) and then she ended the call and was like whatever im going to sleep and then came back a minute later talking about how shes bored of our relationship and im just so tired of dealing with this, its not my fault the relationship is boring like you barely talk to me and none of us have our cars yet… its not necessarily her fault either but like cut me some slack im trying my best, i talk to you everyday as much as i can, and i understand my conversations are the same but thats because she doesnt respond very well so like… idk what to do.",

I have chronic health problems I can't afford to take care of because rent and bills take up my paychecks. I feel like shit every single day and it's a struggle pushing through to work full time. I almost get evicted every month and have to skip groceries some weeks. I have been living this way for almost two years and it is starting to wear me down physically. \n\nI can't sleep at night. I wake up every night around 3AM with my heart pounding and feet sweating. Thoughts racing. Impending doom feelings. Sleep used to be how I escaped the hell that feels like my life but now even it is taken away from me. \n\nI have severe anxiety and depression. I am dissociated 24/7. Nothing feels real. Every day I just go through the motions. Eat, sleep, work. Repeat. Pay bills. Nothing exciting or engaging happens in my life. When I visit family I put on a smile and it feels like I look at the, through a glass wall. Nothing is real and nothing matters. \n\nI went through lots of traumatic events growing up. My nervous system is always on edge waiting for the next crisis to show up. I never feel safe or at ease. \n\nI never learned to drive a car. Never dated. Never had sex. Never experienced the things normal people experience. I was homeschooled my whole life and then we didn't do school at all. I got a GED at 23 and told myself it was a big accomplishment. I was in online college for a computer programming certificate last year but dropped out because my depressed chronically fatigued ass couldn't handle working full time and studying. Now I can't go back because I owe $900 in student loans I will never be able to pay back. \n\nI have let so many people down in life. I have let my family down. I have let my friends down. I have let my pets down. I have let God down. \n\nThe only thing keeping me alive right now is my cat. I have told myself when he dies, I will too. There ain't nothing here for me. There is nothing left for me. I am completely convinced this is all there is for me. ",

I have small group of friends and they’re not within meeting distance. We’re all spread apart. The socialising aspect of my life is not lacking but it is the romantic path that’s filled with craters. I really liked this woman who vibed with me so well. She liked me a lot and wondered if I was telepathic even. We had our first call and within 20 mins she cut the call saying she just wanted to chill and did not want to be pissed on. I just got off a call with my close friend for two hours and I think my attitude and depth got carried over.\nI thought I talked to her like best friends would but she felt I was just obnoxious. I think I gave her a crass vibe and I don’t think there’s a comeback coming from this. \n\nI hate myself and feel like damaged goods, I am failing life and I can’t date anyone I like even. I effing stopped even explaining to people when they misunderstand me, idgaf anymore but it keeps hurting me. If I don’t express anything they think I’m just playing them when I do they move away. The ADHD aspect of my life has ruined my experience with life. I don’t think there exists anyone willing to put up with a menace like me. I missed my ex so much because she was the longest person to have stayed with me and never complained about my erratic behaviour, she loved me for being me. She’s engaged to someone, she’s got her dream life she wanted. \n\nThis hyper feeling I get making me so overexcited is so stupid, what am I? A dog? Why should be so excited for meeting or talking to someone, why can’t I just be normal for once . I have to go and blow up every romantic interest out there. I am the problem, I thought women are too picky but I am quite the undesirable element nobody wants in their life at all. I am destined to be alone. I see people happy all around me with compatible partners or friends but I have zero effing chance of making it far in life…\n\n",

This year I turned 22 and I didn’t even bother to celebrate my birthday. I feel like every year there less and lesser people in my circle wishing me happy birthday. Tbh it don’t really matter that much, but I have a comparison problem and overthinking problem. I have grown a closer relationship with god, but at what cost. Any other department in my life like economics, school and family isn’t going well either. I have notice a pattern that a lot of people be very late when meeting up to me and don’t even bother to inform me until I ask. Then in just me sitting and wasting my whole day around one meeting with them that only last about an hour. I am on my last year of uni yet to meet my friends compared to my highdschool friends that have grown to make way closer friends.

SSRIs made me stable but not better, SNRIs seriously f\\*cked me up, and TCAs were even worse. Encouraged me to try Wellbutrin which I started taking today because she said that's the least aggressive of the possible medical treatments left, but I feel TERRIBLE. My depression is 10/10 bad, anxiety is hell, and I've had some bursts of near tears and passing suicidal thoughts. She warned me my anxiety could get worse at first and I might have trouble sleeping, but didn't mention depression potentially getting worse. I know everyone has a different chemistry, but I did not expect to feel way worse depression wise... \n\nHas this happened to anyone else? Did it eventually get better? Should I stop taking it right away? To be clear, I don't have a plan or anything, have lots of support, and don't plan on killing myself (don't worry!), but I can't imagine working like this come Monday morning.

Im not even obsessed with this, I just draw sometimes and then I see how bad I am and continue doing nothing all day. My life feels so empty that not even feeling something makes sense. Im tired. I don't understand anything. I wish I could feel less empty and be a happy person and enjoy life, but it's probably my fault because im looking everything negatively so yea I should stop doing that and crying about everything",

He has really severe mental health issues and has attempted multiple times before and SHs plus he suspects that he might have BPD. Our parents aren't the best (father was abusive and we now live only with our mother but it's far from perfect) and stuff just generally sucks. \n\nHe messages me about it sometimes but always deletes the messages after. I've been concerned about him for a while but I'm scared of betraying his trust by telling someone about it. Since I'm over 16 and he isn't, he asked me to buy him some paracetamol. I know he plans to OD on them since he's tried that before relatively recently but he hasn't said it explicitly. \n\nAs I mentioned, home life isn't the best and we both have a complicated relationship with our parents. He told me he plans on going misper (missing person) and asked if I minded. I tried to keep my answers relatively neutral overall because I don't want to outwardly support it but I also don't want him to stop talking to me. He seems pretty serious about it and was talking about what he plans to bring. I've had plans to run away at times too but never actually tried anything. Same with suicide attempts. \n\nI have a lot of my own mental health problems that I'm doing my best to recover from (2 month SH clean and working on recovering from an ED!) and honestly talking to him about it makes it worse and I know that's selfish and I'm sorry about it. Regardless, I'm worried about him. \n\nBefore, I just enabled him because I was doing a lot worse and didn't see anything as wrong with it all but I'm trying to get better and I'm scared for him. I know a mental hospital or something would probably be best but from what we've both heard about them it just sounds like it might make things worse. And, again, he's at least telling me about it. If I snitched he'll probably hate me for it and with the trauma he has, it's unlikely that he'll recover easily. \n\nI don't want to lose him - to death or as my brother - but I don't know what to do. I don't have any adults I trust or can speak to. I considered going through school but I don't know how much that would help. I just don't know what to do.",

She wont even help me get medicated because she doesn't believe in it, she thinks its a \"waste of time\". I just want a normal life and opportunities I just want to be happy with myself and my life. I'm just really scared i'm not going to make it past 23, when i'm currently 19. ",

So I was telling my friend that idk if I should force myself to have sex with my bf today and my friend said yes I should because “your bf will appreciate it” and “If you don’t wanna do anything you don’t have to. But I’m saying it would feel really good on his part if he gets to have a part of you for a moment. This gesture might feel like nothing to you but it’s a lot for him” \nI can definitely see the guilt trip and the pressure from my friend but idk maybe i actually should go and see him tn as he deserves someone who is not depressed and someone who can satisfy his need. I also know this sounds crazy and if any of my friends is in this situation, I would tell them to rest and take care of themselves but idk what’s happening to me.

      "selftext": "\nI actually don't know where I' should start so this post may be a bit chaotic\n\n\nOk so just to clarify I'm like extremely young. And that's probably the root of the problem in not sure though. Anyways I feel like I was born on the wrong frequency. Like everyone my age gossips talks abt football trends blah blah. And I'm sitting here thinking about physics and the universe. It sounds kind of arrogant but that's not what's in my heart, genuinely. I'm a teenager early one infact. But It's been pointed out and I've realized it that I'm decades fucking older in my head. I act mature keep calm analyze everything give good life advice scold bad decisions avoid most of what people my age do. Yet I'd give anything to stop being like that and switch my brain off and laugh. But I can't\n\nI dream big I wanna study at MIT become a theoretical physicist win a Nobel. Not due to the money but because I want to understand reality. Map out wave functions unify the fundamental forces, I want and need to touch complete truth. Problem is where I'm from (egypt) you have to rend the skies shake the earth discover a way to actually make pigs fly and ride them to the moon. It's beautiful but it's where dreams get crumpled up and shoved up your ass. The system is complete dogshit th opportunities are tiny and the teachers sometimes give up. Every time I look at my future I see brick walls instead of soors and I somehow need to materialize a sledgehammer to smash the wall and actually get out.\nAnd I worry about everything, if I enter MIT if I win a Nobel if I'll become successful if I'll ever matter and be significant in this life  if I'll leave this shitty country if I'll disappoint my family if I'll waste my potential. And even if I do well my brain immediately looks for the next problem I can't rest inside my own fucking head.\n\nSomething else that bothers me is the loneliness. I've never really had a friend who gets me, or generally friends. I don't have a classmate who listens or anyone who shares the same kind of mind. I can't even do small talk because it's too hard idk it's just complicated. I can converse in silly conversations or some things that interest me but not to the fullest. Its like being a ghost in a crowd people see you but no one knows you. Problem is if I yap to the people that I trust like my mom they just hear not ask I don't care if they don't understand at least care and my dad blatantly tells me to stop yapping. \nProblem is the more I mature the less I fit in. Kids think I'm too serious, sometimes older people think I'm too serious, but adults think I'm too young. I end up being in between watching everyone else move in orbits hell MY AGING PARENTS HAVE CLOSE FRIENDS.\n\nI sometimes remember being a little kid, turning on the Xbox, going to Roblox. And listening to the theme music. It made me happy and tingly as a kid but that tingly turned out to be nostalgia that hasn't been built yet. It makes me remember the simplicity of life. No worries no expectations just peace. I miss that kid, I want the feeling but it isn't coming back.\n\nThe part that scares me the most is my future. I've built a life around thinking planning trying to be better but I forgot how to live. How to be silly to play to make stupid decisions to not be serious. And to fail without caring.\n\nI also can't even vent to my family cuz I've tested the waters twice with my mom it wasn't good. So that's shit\n\nSo this is what I want to do I thought about it today. I want to stop fighting life. I'm gonna vent everything today (it's summarized Ive excited my sad season) and in gonna relax\nI'm gonna study for the knowledge not exams\nI'll talk to whoever and connect with whoever instead dof waiting for a perfect friend\nI'll force myself to be stupid tell bad jokes do something pointless breathe \nAnd if I feel lonely or worried I'll suppress it idk.\nMaybe if I stop controlling everything life will feel fun and real again\n\n\nThe point of the post is to recieve insight, if I can't solve my problems I'll ignore them until time solves them.if I get advice then thank god.",

      "selftext": "(skip to the last two paragraphs if you’re not too bothered about the context) \n\nI am a 16 year old girl, going through absolute shit right now. To sum it up, i’m stuck in an abusive, murderous cult which has power over my family and I, and I fear my family getting murdered, or murdering someone every day. I say murdering someone, because it has happened before. The believers of the cult have killed for the cult leader, and I believe, my dad would kill us too for the cult.\n\nMy dad is not a good dad nor husband and that’s without any questions asked. But it hurts knowing he would kill me in a heart beat for this cult leader. The cult leader got my dad married to my mums family member before her back, and when my mum found out she started passing out, having anxiety attacks and had to go hospital because she couldn’t breathe and her heart hurt. Seeing that, really struck something in me.\n\nAs i said, my dad’s a horrible father. I won’t get too much into what he’s done but he calls me ugly multiple times a day and cusses me for even just sitting down. My mum has told me multiple times that she wants to kill herself and jump in front of a car and what not, but I don’t know how to deal with that information. I cried at first, but she told me it so much that i became immune to it. My mum would also side with my dad when he would curse at me calling me horrendous things , but it’s understandable to a point, because he’s her husband. So even if i do nothing wrong i get shouted at. My mum has hit herself with a shoe and acted psycho multiple times, and sometimes (and i feel so guilty for saying this), i don’t like how she acts in front of us - her kids. She is a lovely mother, but she has traumatised me before. I have overheard her saying to my aunty that when i was a child she didn’t like me compared to my brothers  , but when i was older i was more useful or prettier to her so she learned to like me. \n\nOn top of this, i’m so ugly. I feel like a piece of shit. When i’m in school , no boys look at me. I’m just an ugly weird. It doesn’t help that i’ve joined a new school, and the friends i’ve made are horrible. One of the girls calls me dumb on the daily and just speaks about boys 24/7 . The teachers make me sad too, they’re horrible.\n\nI have no friends, those that i mentioned in school are purely lunchtime friends. They don’t care about me, i really and truly have 0 friends. All my old friends have left me and dropped me for stupid reasons.\n\nAnyways, back to the title. I have had suicidal thoughts playing on my mind for quite a while. I used to self harm, and only do it now every few months. Whenever I get suicidal thoughts, i would just look to my drawer next to me, which encompassed two packets of paracetamol. And honestly, i would contemplate taking it. The only thing truly stopping me wanting to kill myself is my religon, and i feel even God isn’t listening to me anymore.. but i know he is. It got to a point where i had to move my paracetamol as I was scared that one night it would all be too much and i would take it . \n\nToday, I had enough. Whilst praying, I saw my robe in front of me with a rope (to tie around the waist), and I thought that i would only feel how it’s like to commit suicice, to feel that rope clasping around my neck. And so, after praying, i said my declaration of faith and got the rope and tied it around my neck and pulled it. I didn’t pull it enough to make me kill myself, but i pulled it enough so i could feel myself near choking on my own breath. I just wanted to see what it felt like. And I don’t understand why i did it, can someone help make me understand why i did that? If i had no intention to actually kill myself? Maybe it was that i wanted someone to realise im struggling, to actually ask me if i’m okay and care.",

      "selftext": "19F here. After numerous failed attempts at killing myself, I think I can successfully do it one more time. I’ve been debating whether or not I should go through with it again. I need advice. Here is my story:\nGrowing up I was seen as a sexual object for many individuals. I had developed early and of course many creepy men took advantage of that. I was sexually assaulted, touched inappropriately, told sexual things growing up, etc. I never told anyone because I never had anyone to talk to. My mom and dad have always been hard on me and I never found it easy to talk to them, as they would just shut my story down and tell me to shut up. I’ve always felt like a burden since I was born. I’ve never been good enough for my mother. My dad’s an alcoholic and doesn’t like me. I’ve never had real friendships and my mom has been practically the only one “there for me.” Although, she was never really there for me emotionally. Fast forward, to high school, I made the volleyball team and this is when my sports career really took off. My mom actually started caring about me (I thought…). My mom would go to all my games, take me to practice, supported me, ect. I had a plan to play volleyball in college and I had planned on going into the medical field. Then when I get to my senior year, I decided volleyball wasn’t something I wanted to continue with. My senior year, I got my first boyfriend and I started hanging out with him because he was the only person who wanted to hang out with me. I was excited to finally be seen and heard by someone. My mom of course didn’t like that I had a boyfriend and wanted me to be miserable at home with her. Anyways, the relationship was going great and then he raped me. Not one, not twice, over and over again. I broke up with him and started dating a new guy. The new guy sexually assaulted me, took naked pictures of me without my knowledge, cheated on me with a crackhead, etc. I broke up with this guy too. Finally, I graduated high school with the highest honors, then I started working at a law firm. I had no intentions of staying at this firm because I was going to go to college. Well, I ended up staying at this law firm because they have on the job training to become a paralegal. This law firm, is my current job. I work with three other people, 2 male attorneys and a female paralegal. Of course, one of the attorneys (my boss) and the paralegal are having an affair. The paralegal, whom I’ll call Angie, is making my life miserable at my job. She treats me like absolute garbage because “she doesn’t want me near her mans.” So, she deletes my work, cuts my paycheck short, won’t pay me overtime I work, tells me I’m ruining the firm, etc. I am the longest employee they have had working at that firm because the ‘Angie’ runs all employees off. Anyways, I started dating a guy who is just the sweetest thing on earth. His name is Dylan. I love him to death and he treats me like a human being. He’s been including me with his friends and everything. For the first time in my life I’ve felt love. My mom doesn’t like Dylan. She told me she liked my past boyfriends better, even though they had raped and abused me. After I started dating Dylan my mom has been having mental episodes. I still live with my mom, but I’m trying to move out as soon as possible. My mom is nice one minute, then she snaps and goes into this rage. For context, my mother is 65 and had me in her late 40’s (I was a mistake, which she tells me every time she gets a chance). My mom calls me a worthless piece of shit everyday, calls me lazy, she just flat out hates me. I’m expected to cater to her always. I have to clean the house, do the laundry, cook for her, clean up my dads empty beer cans laying everywhere, etc. It gets exhausting. My mom is a hoarder and throws her junk everywhere after I just cleaned. She constantly has to “borrow money” from me but never returns it and says she’s gonna keep it for my bills she pays. But, I pay for all my bills… I am basically on my own, I just live my mom. I’m going to turn 20 soon. And I just realize how my entire life has been controlled by her. I don’t have friends because of her, I don’t have happy memories, I lack social skills, I have severe depression and anxiety, I feel like I’m constantly walking on egg shells around her, I never got my full high school experience. Last year, I was in the same spot I am in right now. Nothing has changed. I am losing my sanity. I do the same thing everyday, wake up, go to work, go home and get yelled at and go to bed. The only person I really have is my bf and I think he might be starting to get sick of me. I’m constantly asking him for advice and for help, but he doesn’t seem to really care about the situation I’m in. I think next year I’ll be in the same spot. I don’t want to continue my life like this. I want to have friends, I want to be able to go out and have fun without worrying about what my mom will think, I want to be able to love my bf without my mom hating on me, I just want to live my own life. I’m tired of being controlled by her. I actually think the only way out is suicide. I’m gonna be stuck in this same shitty little town, making the same hourly wages, never going to be able to move out due to high rent prices. I forgot to mention, I have very bad health problems. I struggle to eat and have lost a ton of weight because of it. I’m on tons of medications, had surgeries in the past and I still feel like shit. I have no energy, I throw up every time I eat, I’m just exhausted, and doctors don’t understand what’s happening to me. I just want to die. ",

I have many appointments with doctors, surgeons and oncologyst. My oncologyst told me that I have ++- stage 1 breast cancer. I really didn't believe at first that I had cancer and eveyone told me I should trust the doctors. They told me I should do double mastectomy because of my age but I choose to do a single one. I also lost my left nipple because the lesion was near the nipple. I told my family I had cancer and my friends. They all are believers. They prayed for me and even cried. I also have a women group support, I called them eveyday. I even preserved my eggs just in case.\n\nOn september 4 I had my single mastectomy. And they also did another pathology on the breast tissue. I had my appoitment today, they found out that it was really an Atypical hyperplasia (not cancer condition) according to the last patology...... I was in shocked, my oncologyst was too happy for me because I was not sick. I really have mixed feelings. Feels like all of the things I did, I did it for nothing...... I lost my breast and nipple for nothing. Should I be grateful? Did I make the right decision? The only reason I was copping with the lost was because I was trying to save my life.......\n\n(Sorry for my english, my first language is spanish)",

That person ended the relationship. The relationship lasted five, almost six years, and she ended it because, unfortunately, we had to be apart for the last few years, and she couldn't handle the distance and said she couldn't love me the right way. She ended it in early July, and now it's October, and I'm depressed. I was also diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, so I feel so bad that I can't even explain how I feel because there are so many bad emotions. I've tried to end my life, but it didn't work. However, I increasingly have thoughts of ending it all. What doesn't help is that I'm a lesbian because what I've been feeling is that I wish I had been born a straight woman or a man because it would be everything would be easier and I would fit in better in society and be treated differently, because I also feel that straight men and women have it much easier in everything compared to people with other sexual orientations. I feel that it is very difficult to find someone to share your life with, and even if you do find that person, it is very difficult to find them, and it seems that our world for those who are not straight is very limited.

I dont understand what they get out of it - why they keep doing it. I'm 16 and I feel like im in some fucked up version of the truman show. How is this real? How is everyone not suicidal? I really dont understand. What gets people out of bed in the morning? What makes them fight so hard to survive in this fucked up world. I dont get it. This world is horrible. Like I genuinely believe Hell was inspired by it. Theres so much hated, death - Innocent good people die every single day, Horrible sick people get rewarded at the same time. Its pure fucking Chaos. There's no structure or rules to it either. Theres absolutely nothing you can do to prevent death. Not a single person is safe from it - safe from being randomly murdered in the streets, in the \"wrong place at the wrong time\". No one is safe from random terminal illnesses - we could all drop dead at any goddamn moment, and no one seems bothered by it. \"You cant think like that\" isnt an answer. How can we not??? I can't do it. I need there to be rules to the chaos. There has to be some sort of structure. I cant just accept that me, my family, my friends - anyone, could die in the next five minutes. \n\nIt all feels like something out of an episode of fucking Squid Games or some shit - billions of people racing to the 'finish line' (Aka. Dying of old age) as people around - friends, family, even themselves- are shot down at random. We're meant to just live hoping its not us??? I'm meant to fight so hard to live in a world that's soaked in pain and suffering?? And im the weird one for thinking this is fucked up? For thinking fuck no, sign me the fuck out? I don't get it. Ive felt like this for years btw - its not some depression induced mindset. I genuinely believe if my depression was magically cured tomorrow Id still be suicidal- because I dont want to live in this world. And I dont understand how anyone could. I watch my parents, family members, literally anyone over the age of 20 and just try understand what they get out of living. How the hell are people reaching the age of 80? Living for 80 years sounds horrible - I think my worst fear would be to live for anywhere near that long. \n\nI feel like something is missing in my head. Like was I born with zero survival instincts or some shit? Or maybe a pair of rose tinted glasses over my eyes? Can someone please answer what makes people want to live? I feel like I'm going insane",

The last couple of years have been especially hard for a number of reasons. A couple of months ago things were really bad. I was as close as I’ve ever been to giving up and unaliving myself. \n\nI’m now doing better than I have been for a long while, thanks to a good support system, finally getting on a different combo of meds that are working and giving me some more energy, and getting a new therapist who I think is going to be good to work with. \n\nI know I have a lot to be grateful for, and plenty of reasons why I should be happy. I have a family that loves me, a roof over my head and food on my table. So many people in the world have it so much worse than I do. I get that. But… the current state of the world and my country (I live in the U.S.) is terrifying and getting worse by the day.  I’m broke, deeply in debt, and living paycheck to paycheck. I have to find a new job by the end of the year (the nonprofit I work for cannot afford to keep me on staff full time), and I have no idea what I’m going to do for work and the job market is only getting worse in my area. And I live every day with extreme, crippling dysphoria about my body. All this fills me with so much fear and anxiety and dread. \n\nI still can’t seem to get through the day without having intrusive thoughts of self harm and even on a good day, I can’t shake the feeling that life is totally pointless and hopeless and not worth it. I just cannot envision a future where things are better and I’m happy. No matter what I do, all these thoughts are always right there under the surface, even when everyone around me thinks I’m happy or doing ok. \n\nHow do you keep those thoughts at bay?  \n\nHow do you overcome the fears and anxieties that want to paralyze you and keep you from moving forward? \n\nHow do you convince yourself that things will be ok, or get better, when there’s no evidence that they will? \n\nHow do you appreciate and find joy and comfort and hope in the good things, when the bad things seem so overwhelming?\n\nI realize I’m just screaming into the void and that no one will probably even read this, let alone respond, but I just needed to vent somewhere.

They are the main reason I feel I have no option but death, and why I've been suicidal for years. It's impossible for me to stop hating him or being upset, especially since I live with him and will have to until I die. Being with him every day, listening to his taunts and blames is exhausting, especially when I know he has completely ruined my life and still plays the victim, always blaming me.\n\nBut I am also making everything harder on myself. My hatred for the people around me and my jealousy of happy people is eating me alive. I don't want to die as such a terrible and bitter person. I want to be able to forgive and ignore my father (maybe some of the mistakes were mine, too, if only I'd had more courage as a child). I want to forget everything.\n\nI want to be happy for other people when I see them happy. At least they got what I never could in this life. I just want to die as a happy and peaceful person, but the way I am now, constantly frustrated, ungrateful and filled with hate, makes it incredibly difficult to even get through each day. It's even affecting my ability to work.\n\nMy final wish is to complete all my remaining projects, enjoy life a little bit, and then have a peaceful death. I don't want to die as someone who is always crying, unable to complete their work on time, and jealous of everyone. It's not like I express my hate or any emotions to anyone, but I don't want to feel these emotions also anymore. I just want to be peaceful internally.\n\nIdk how to achieve this, especially while living with my family 24/7. But still by any way possible ignoring them and peacefully living until my death.",

Things have been going so well for so long. But unfortunately, depression is my forever battle and it has recently gained some ground. \n\nWhile I move through this it’s important that I stay active for myself and my family. This morning I could not take my babies to pre-school (my husband picked up my slack) or go to the gym because of my eyes. If I had appointments with clients I would have had to cancel. \n\nIf I sleep within a few hours of crying I wake up looking like I’ve been stung in the eyes by bees. It’s a drastic contrast to how I usually present myself and I’m hyper aware of people’s double takes and all the walls are mirrors at the gym. So I would like to hide from even myself. That, and a teacher or client asking me if I’m okay would sink me. \n\nI just need to get through this and back to normal with big eye shields I can wear indoors (plus a hat) to work out and look my kids, clients, and their teachers in the eyes without fear or shame until I’m better.",

I’m in contact with an ex who reached out to me months later after break up (we broke up cos of his depression). We met up a few times and all was going great until this person was triggered and started to withdraw. This is making me so anxious I know they suffer with depression more so this time of year and I’ve noticed that they are in a depressive episode at the minute. All the signs are there. But the no contact is making my anxiety go through the roof. Just wondering is this normal and if anyone has went through a depressive episode can they explain to me how it feels from their side. I just want to understand is the withdrawal normal. Hope this all makes sense",

My doctor prescribed:\n\t•\t20 mg daily for the first 9 months\n\t•\tThen another 3 months on 20 mg\n\t•\tThen reduced to 10 mg for 3 months\n\nAt that point, I felt used to the medication and wasn’t ready to stop. But when I tried to quit on my own, I faced difficult symptoms:\n\t•\tShortness of breath returned\n\t•\tPanic attacks (crise de panique)\n\t•\tExtreme tension and overreaction to small things\n\t•\tIncreased irritability\n\t•\tSome skin sensitivity/pain in certain areas that made it hard to touch\n\nBecause of these issues, I went back to 20 mg again without the doctor’s advice.\n\nThis experience taught me that stopping any psychiatric or anti-anxiety medication should only be done under a doctor’s supervision. Doing it suddenly made my symptoms much worse.\n\n👉 Has anyone else had similar experiences with Isoprex or other medications? How did you manage to stop it safely?",

I am in a friend group who wouldn't miss me if I died, or if they did it'd be like for 3 days or maybe a week. I'm sure theyd get over it super fast. My parents might be sad for a month or two but I know they could move past it, and with college admissions I'm stressing them out when they're old and have heart issues and I don't want to contribute to that anymore. Anyways all of this made me realize that my life is a net negative to others around me combined with the fact that I haven't been happy in so long, I'm thinking of just committing. I did want to be a doctor to help people before because I thought that would be a worthwhile use of my life even if I wasn't happy doing it, I thought I might as well do something to help people if I wont be happy anyway. However, something happened in my life and I dont think itll be possible anymore. I want to do something useful before I die though so I can leave even a minutely positive effect on the world. Something to contribute to the betterment of someone or something. I wish I could have done more, but I just know I won't be able to knowing what kind of a failure I am in life. No matter how much I keep going I can't seem to change, which isn't anyones faults but me. I just want to know if you guys have any idea for what I can do to make a difference before I die, I'll take any ideas. And if there's one takeaway I can provide from my story, it'd be to spread kindness. I fed into the hate that so many around me spewed out because I thought it would help me fit in but I realize now all it did was alienate me from those who could've supported me and it didn't dp anything to lessen my role as a loser to to those around me. Anyways, plaesae give me suggestions, thank you.",

As long as I’ve remembered well into my young years I’ve literally hated every single aspect of life and no matter what I do there’s a small voice in the back of my mind telling me it’s the wrong thing.\n\nWell maybe I should’ve listened to it. No matter what decision I make, I always feel like I’m going the wrong way. Growing up I was partially alienated from my surroundings because I immigrated and was unable to secure any stable relationships friends or otherwise. Even when I did settle down in a suburb, the damage of being a shut in was already done and I never made any meaningful memories or close friends. Not a single person in my life, besides my girlfriend, would I confidently say will ever chose me first. I’ve never had a true best friend. I’ve never played a sport. And I’ve never done anything like hunting or camping or hiking or even fucking studying hard. I just lived to pass time and even now I only live because I feel like my parents wasted too much time and too many resources for me to just kill myself.\n\nThere’s been some highlights. I met my aforementioned girlfriend two years ago and I thought the feeling of euphoria would last forever and carry me to seniority but I’m right back to feeling so depressed all the time. And it got worse ever since my car accident. I severely damaged my left hand and now have an exponentially worse quality of life, even more so than back when I was genuinely suicidal. \n\nI have no productive hobbies, no discernible drive, I go through every day to pass the time, daydreaming about the past and wishing I could go back and not be a complete failure. Sometimes I wish terrible things would happen to me, like my girlfriend breaking up with me or my family disowning me. I wish these things would happen so that I can finally have a final justification for ending my own life. Because worst of all is that I know I have it good. \n\nI’m a moderately attractive Asian dude (meaning height isn’t as much of an issue) pursuing a lucrative degree in a median income household. Theoretically I should have no reason to kill myself. But regrets and self hatred have filled me my whole life and from what I’ve heard it never gets better. You just get older, sadder, and reminisce on things you wish you did. \n\nIf someone were to make a pill that made me 10 again, they’d be a goddamn trillionaire. ",

      "selftext": "I'm 49 now and only just realized that my bullies weren't being mean. They were trying to teach me! They somehow knew at an early age that I was a born outcast. I have always been someone who read never supposed to have any kind of relationship outside of the ones my family was obligated to. I wasn't supposed to have friends, girlfriends, no one. I don't know how those kids knew it but, they did. I just refused to listen. I kept trying to make friends, kept wanting to find love. Over the years, each person not obligated to be in my life has left it. Some quicker than others. I don't know why I was destined for solitude but, I need to just accept it and leave everything.

Hasta vi unos videos tristes para poder llorar pero fue imposible jajaja, me gustaría conocer  las experiencias de alguien más con el mismo medicamento. Creo que me van a aumentar la dosis, pero esto me tiene sentiéndome un poco desconcertada porque me gusta, pero a la vez no.

I just kinda went into automatic survival mode going in, setting my expectations real low and just trying my best to study each day. Took me quite a while to realize that I'm actually doing pretty well so far, more than what I expected at least. I even got a perfect score on a test recently which was a miracle. Everything was doing well.\n\nThen I had a brief opportunity to have a full night's rest when I woke up from a dream. I've forgotten most of the context of the dream already, all I know is that it was very sad. A very sad event that prompted me to run away from. Then I was a kid again, being embraced by my late mom and sang me a lullaby she used to sing to me. I woke up with tear marks on my face, feeling extremely sad.\n\nI don't know what happened really. Maybe it was the growing pressure of achievement? I was quite a high-achieving student all my school life (with a chronic case of low self-esteem and confidence). Or maybe it was the other emotions I've been bottling up ever since going survival mode in school. I've often struggled with sadness when I'm not locked into something, like studying. It could also be my unresolved grief over my late mom. I still miss her a lot and lost her too soon. Maybe a bit of all of them, I just don't know exactly.",

I got driven to the ER, social worker talked to me, I was on a 5150 hold for a little over a week, then got sent home with new medication and a therapist to meet up with every week. It was my first (and hopefully last) attempt at my life, so we called it a call for help and not a genuine attempt to end it all. I still don’t know how true that is, but I do know that depression was what led me there.\n\nI don’t know. I guess I just thought that after two years things would better, but it feels like they’ve gotten worse. I just feel like I should’ve died that first time, and that me being here just doesn’t make sense. It follows me in everything I do. \n\nBy all means I should be fine at this point. I turned 20 a couple months ago and celebrated it with my friends. I just accepted a job offer to work (nothing big, just a job at a grocery store, but it’s something.) I am doing better at managing chores. College is working out fine, even though I don’t know what I’m going to do with my degree. But every time I put effort into something, every time I achieve or celebrate something, I feel physically sick. I shouldn’t have had to put that effort in, or have achieved that, or have celebrated that. I shouldn’t even be here. I don’t know what I’m doing here, or what I’ll do in the future. It seeps into every single thing I do. \n\nPeople always try to reassure me, tell me that I’m just 20, I have my whole life ahead of me, to figure things out. I know I do. That’s what makes me depressed. \n\nI keep getting told that depression can’t hit a moving target. All I do is move, and the depression is still there. It’s innate. It’s who I am, at this point, and you can move as much as you want, exercise and dance and run, but you can’t run away from yourself. \n\nI don’t know what to do, or how to explain it, or if I’m alone in this. I only talk to my therapist about stuff like this, but I can’t ever explain it as much as I want to be able to. I just end up crying. ",

      "selftext": "Trigger: Addiction,self\n\n\n\nHey everyone who's reading this. Just a couple of things upfront:\n\n1. There's gonna be a lot of info here, and a lot of it might just sound like whining – even to me. So I don't expect this post to get much interest.\n2. I'd appreciate honest criticism, but not straight-up hate. Other than that, I'm just happy for any feedback. This is already so long, I had to cut out a bunch. Feel free to ask me anything, thoug.\n3. Sorry if some things aren't clear because of typos. For my own peace of mind, I'm not writing in my native language, and this is my first time posting anything like this.\n\nI don't know where to start... probably because I'm not even sure what the point of this is. But I'll try to give you the bullet points of my short life.\n\nI'm not even 18 for another couple of months, but I feel like I've already turned my life into a complete shitshow with no way out. It started off standard: bullying in elementary school, family problems. But by age 9, instead of just becoming a quiet kid, my path took a sharp turn into the wrong crowd. By 10, I was smoking, getting into fights, self-harming, and dreaming of being a \"rebel with a shaved head.\" My parents were too busy with their own \"self-improvement\" and fighting with each other to notice I was going downhill.\n\nBy 11, I was a full-blown alcoholic with a reputation as a nasty teen – and yeah, I got that short haircut too, even though my dad was dead against it. At 12, I discovered uppers and had my first overdose, which my parents finally couldn't ignore.\n\nAges 13 to 15 were... a lot. House arrests, beatings, running away from home? sexual assault, my first shitty relationship (with an older drug addict, of course). At 14, I was officially wanted by the police for at least two reasons. Let's just say I got incredibly lucky and managed to soften the consequences, probably because I was still a minor.\n\nAfter that, when I was brought back home, my parents finally admitted I needed help – unfortunately, not just therapy (the school psychologist had told them I was depressed when I was 10, but they thought a simple apology would fix everything).\n\nSo at 14, I started seeing a psychiatrist whose competence I seriously question. I complained about hallucinations, sleep paralysis, constant tremors, nightmares, panic attacks, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, you name it. For a year and a half, they tried to find the right meds for me (they never told me my diagnosis). It was always the same cycle: three weeks of the meds working, then the symptoms came back, they'd increase the dose or switch me to something stronger.\n\nI never achieved remission, and they really pushed for me to be hospitalized. So I made the brilliant decision to quit treatment and handle it myself. (Spoiler: it didn't go well).\n\nEarly in my \"recovery,\" I got into a relationship with another guy, older than the last and with even worse habits. Of course, he turned out to be a total asshole who messed up my head even more. Because of that relationship (which I smartly ended), I started using again at 16 and went on a six-month bender. On the plus side, I worked 4 jobs during that time and became a total workaholic.\n\nBy 17, I moved to a big city, managed to quit all my addictions, and found a healthy relationship... well, a good partner. I doubt you can call a relationship with me healthy. I truly believed things would be better in a new place, but I've been here a year now... and I have less than nothing. I lost my job due to unfair treatment, and I haven't made a single friend or even an acquaintance. My mental health has gotten worse, now with psychotic delusions, paranoia, and complete social isolation.\n\nMy current boyfriend and I were long-distance for the first six months because he couldn't move right away. I thought when he finally joined me, things would get better. Nope. Lately, he just feels like a reminder of my own failure. He found a good job where people respect him, made a solid friend effortlessly, all while complaining to me about how bad he had it.\n\nYeah, I'm jealous. On top of that, probably because of my mental state, I've stopped feeling or wanting anything, and unfortunately, that includes him.I know and remember that I love him, honestly I do, but I can't feel it. I can't bring myself to sleep with him because I've suddenly developed a panic towards any physical contact due to discomfort with my own body (I've struggled with anorexia and I guess I'm relapsing, since we got a scale at home). And honestly, I feel so guilty for everything that's happening to me, and how it affects my sweet boy. But fuck, he drives me crazy sometimes with his dumbness and self-pity.\n\nSo for the last month and a half, my life has been a complete shitshow with no exit in sight. And with each day, I feel less like even looking for one. I don't want to live like this. I guess I don't want to live at all, but I don't want to kill myself either. I just wish I could dissolve, to just not exist, but not die by my own hand...\n\nMy life has only just begun, but in my mind, I have already failed to live and finish it with dignity. I need a help",

Voy a entrar a carrera, seguir estudiando por 4 años, y luego tener un trabajo, donde todos los días seguiré pensando en que mañana va a ser exactamente lo mismo. Si tengo amigos, tengo muy buena familia, estoy bien respecto a nivel de vida, pero realmente de qué me sirve si voy a vivir una vida donde todo sea cansancio y estrés, realmente no lo entiendo.\n\nMe gustaría escuchar de alguien que haya pasado por lo mismo, si tiene algún tip para no sentirme tan desesperanzado.

One relies on me financially and I'm barely making ends meet.\n\nOne of them recently took a large envelope of cash I had made, that I needed to deposit to cover bills, and they lost it.  They say they planned to go out and pay my bills as a surprise.   They do things like this, to help me, and every time it's a disaster.  This is the first time they took my cash, and they feel so guilty they won't do it again, but it didn't seem to make them understand they need to be more careful and think things through.\n\nHe also came in my house while I was napping and \"took out the trash\"  It was my laundry, in bags, that I had sat in the bedroom to fold and put away.  I didn't realize they were gone until after the trash truck had been here.  I lost almost all my clothes and bedding.  He didn't understand that I would never have 4 bags of trash sitting in my bedroom.  That doesn't even make sense.  I never have trash sitting out in my home. And these were cheap canvas bags not trash bags.  He doesn't think rationally and the more I tell him to think things through, the more he wants to rebel against me.   Another occasion he rearranged my furniture in my house, putting things in the weirdest places. I took back the keys to my place.  After taking back the keys, I came home and he was picking up pieces of my outdoor pots outside, they were all moved, and some cracked. He had moved them \"for me\" and in the process broke three pots.  He said where I had them blocked my view of the road. It didn't.\n\nThey aren't responsible adults, I don't understand why they had me.  I was planned.  The third child, but once I was here, they didn't want me.  My father took off, and my mom was very angry about having me.  I wonder if it was an attempt to fix the marriage and she was furious with me that it didn't work.  That I didn't fix everything. He came back after I was born,  I can tell my dad never wanted to be a dad.  And my mom wishes she didn't have a daughter. I felt so alone growing up feeling like the third wheel watching them as a family.  But when we grew up, the other two children ended up being bums, and I'm responsible, so\n\nEverything falls on my shoulders.  I feel so run down",

He didn't attempt to hold my hand, and he barely said a handful of words to me the whole time. You know what that tells me? I'm an ugly piece of shit. I'm tired of doing things with people and I'm just there, it's like I don't exist. I'm just a body taking up space with another body, just taking up space. Now I sit writing on Reddit in my room alone because I am a loser and I don't know why I try. I guess I don't. That's why I'm here. I tell people my plans, and I can tell they're just thinking \"sure\" all sarcastic and mentally rolling their eyes. I truly hate people, and I think it shows. I just wish there was a way to blink, And everything is either over or okay. But I blink, and nothing ever happens.\n\nI think my problem was that I was born human when some of us, and by us, I mean me, would just be better off as a flea or a bee , but not something that's as conscious as a human. I'm tired of the rejection. And I'm tired of the knowledge that nobody cares. I think there comes a point when suicide is just a mercy killing.\n\nThe smallest inconvenience makes me want to jump off a bridge. I don't know how much longer I'm gonna last. Just waiting for the other shoe to drop because it always does.And I'm just waiting for the drop to finally be hard enoug, When the little bit of hope I must still have remaining can go away. \n\nI'm the reason people say nobody's perfect. I'm the reason people lock their doors, because there's bad, ugly people out there. I'm that kid from school who's name nobody remembers, but you see her and go \"oh yeah, that loser.\" I'm the epitome of pathetic and maybe, if I keep reminding myself of this, I'll finally wake up and know that this is the day I'm finally gonna do it and I'm finally gonna be successful.

      "selftext": "I’m 31 female, unmarried, living alone due to verbally abusive father whose mood is unpredictable. Due to other deeper rooted family issues, I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety and depression. I’m currently on antidepressants and go to therapy once a week.\n\nI’ve been struggling with this for the past five years and it seems like I can’t pick myself up. I used to have a bubbly and outgoing personality. I still do sometimes, but there’s a lot of “heaviness” around me. And my friends feel it too. I am often afraid that I’m too much to handle for my friends or family. I don’t even share everything only bits and pieces because I don’t want to overwhelm anyone. \n\nBut basically my situation is the following: \n1. due to depression I can’t finish my university degree.i try and try but one of the side effects of depression is cognitive decline.\n\n2. My last experiences with jobs were horrible, which made me lose hope in having a job that interests me.\n\n3. My finances are a mess. I don’t have dept, but I also don’t have Any savings. \n\n4. I’m single and loneliness eats me alive sometimes. On the one hand I feel like once a partner knows about my depression and how deeply flawed I am, they wouldn’t love me anymore. On the other hand I have expectations and I can’t settle. After suffering every kind of abuse you can imagine, I run at the first red flags.\n\nPeople always tell me I’m very beautiful and have a nice aura. I’m also intellectual, funny and strong minded, which seems to intimidate a lot of men. But my strength and my humor come from having to overcome extremely harsh situations in life. \n\nAt the end of the day I genuinely feel hopeless. Everyday is a battle. I pull myself up most of the times and force myself to be busy but I don’t see much change. Surely I have moments of joy and gratitude, but sometimes when I’m home alone the emptiness overcomes me again. No matter how much work I put in, I seem to land back to this dark place where I feel like a loser in life. Any advice? ",

I am barely functioning at all and theres nothing i can do about it. i dont want to scare my family or my boyfriend but i really feel like im going to have a mental break. im really trying not to be scary while writing this so to put it nicely: im having a very hard time with my thoughts.",

For several months, I laughed it off as him \"trying it on\", but in actuality, I said no, and he touched me anyway.\nI told my boss about what had happened when it really dawned on me. He told me it was a \"misunderstanding\" and that I shouldnt go to the police, so I didnt.\n\nJust some further background because it will be relevant. I was outed at school at 15. My uncle worked as a teacher at my school and when i got home, he was there, where he outed me, too. I was lucky - my family were great about it, but ive felt distant from them ever since. I wasnt ready to be out, and after the worst day of my life by then, i wanted to go home and forget it all, and then it continued. When i was 16, i was diagnosed with depression. This was likely the inciting incident for that chemical change.\n\n2 years post SA, my mental health had plummeted. I had worked for 7 years to build my precarious jenga tower of mental health to a point where i could feel happy and healthy, and it toppled because i kept it all in and tried to put that weight on top. My absence at work had skyrocketed and i was genuinely suicidal. I was called for an absence meeting, where i broke down and admitted that i had been working with my assaulter and the man who told me not to do anything about it for 2 years. I was told there was nothing they could do because it happened before i started working there. (In a later meeting, i was told by HR that if i feel the situation is untenable, i should consider finding employment elsewhere).\n\nThe treatment i received at the hands of my employer was vile. I was regularly pulled up on imagined offences, forced to work closely with my assaulter, and scrutinised down to signing off my emails with \"Thanks, [name]\" being questioned. I was told i wasnt resilient despite all that i had been through and actually improving my attendance despite the circumstances. I left that job suddenly and quickly and immediately moved on to another.\n\nThe problem, then, was that i hadnt processed any of the trauma i had been through. Another sidebar here: in order to cope with the crippling depression, in an attempt to feel something; some semblance of control, i developed a binge eating disorder. When you have no energy to even wash yourself, you arent making food or going shopping. I was ordering insane amounts of takeout. I would order enough food for a family and eat it all, and then i would starve myself for days, only to binge again. Where did i get the funds to do that? Good question. i was living with 2 friends who had trusted me with the finances of the house. They paid into my account, i paid out. We agreed to pay a little extra to have some left over for emergencies. I used that money. I stole, over the course of a couple of years, £2000. From my friends. This shattered my relationships. My 2 best friends hated me, and they were right to. I hated myself. I hated the friend who SAd me. I hated my old employer. I hated my new employer for being kind to me. I hated myself the most, though. I hated myself so much. When my friend suggested i returned home and stayed with my parents, i spent my savings on a hotel room. I couldnt face my family. I just wanted to die, but the hotel had safety windows, spotlights, an embedded shower head etc., so i couldnt. I couldnt even die.\n\nBack to work - my trauma, both from the events inflicted on me and the harm i had caused were still unresolved, unmanaged, and underpinning every decision i made. I went off sick at my new place, unable to even look my colleagues in the eyes. They didnt know i was a theif. They didnt know i was disgusting and poisonous. They didnt know that the people telling me i was wrong about my SA had convinced me id made it up to harm someone. They were good people. They didnt deserve to have to put up with me, but mostly, i was a shell. I didnt feel anything but self loathing. I have never hated myself so much. I screwed up everything i touched. \n\nI left that place. It had been tainted by my inability to do anything right. I felt so much shame for what they knew of me - that i was flaky and unreliable, and what they didnt - i was a disgusting piece of shit who stole from his friends and tried to ruin someone elses life. \n\nI started a new job in the prison service. Who knows, maybe i would be killed and i wouldnt have to even do it myself. As you can imagine, that didnt go well, either. I was outed to the gang members on my wing and they tried to break down the office i was in to attack me. This happened after i voiced concerns about my safety. The governers didnt care. I left there, and started another new job, this time a similar role to the one i loved at the first place before my SA blew my life apart.\n\nHe had worked there previously, though, and every time i walked into that room, i saw him. I saw his time working there, his impact, his ideas all over the space. I couldnt escape him. The job was very negative, too. The bits i had loved at my first place  werent there - i had brought those in. I had worked hard to make those happen, and i would have to do all that work again. I would have to start from scratch, and i was so exhausted. My depression reared its head, months of intensive therapy only able to hold it back for so long, and i spiralled. I couldnt rebuild again. I didnt deserve to. I didnt WANT to. I was signed off by a doctor again. \nMy absence became an issue again. The support offered was unhelpful. Lots of platitudes and signposting and offers of a listening ear that never materialised. They tried. I could see that, but they didnt know what to do any more than i did. I quit.\n\nI found a new job. Different field, exciting, enticing, and makes use of my skills perfectly. I applied, i got it. I handed in my notice, signed my new contract, received my welcome pack. I was excited to start on monday. I got a call on friday.\nThey withdrew my offer. My references werent satisfactory. A clause in my contract i was told not to worry about made it all legal. It was november last year. Right before christmas. I had plans to save on my new salary, to move out of my parents home at 27. I was excited about my future, and it all disappeared just like that. \n\nI kept positive. I applied for more jobs, i heard back from another i had applied for. I found temporary employment to pay my rent, but it wasnt enough. My debts went unpaid in order to pay my rent. I fought the drive to fall back into disordered eating. I did so successfully. The temporary work was poorly planned and disorganised. I suffered financially for the mistakes of others. My credit file imploded. There goes any goals of moving out.\nEventually, when the constant self reassurance failed, the spiral i was resting above was steep and sharp and i fell fast. Rock bottom doesnt exist. Its just an endless pit. A void within which you fall. You pray to land, you hope to hit the floor hard and fast enough for it all to just stop, but you never do. You just get lost in it. Youd think youd stop feeling the fall, but you dont. The deafening wind on the way down doesnt drown out your crying. It doesnt steal away the judgement others give you. It just hurts. You dont feel weightless either. I suppose it feels more like sinking really fast, because you know the further you fall, the less light youll see, and the more crushing the pressure becomes. \n\nI got an interview. I thought i failed. They shut down over the chistmas period, so when they offered me the job in january, i felt, once again, like the new year would be different. Then, 4 months in, i saw him again. He was laughing with someone. So casual, so calm, so content. His clothes were expensive, i could just tell. I knew hed been promoted but i let that wash off me. It was hard to ignore now. We locked eyes, and i ran. I dropped my basket in the supermarket and acted like i was being chased by lions. Thats how it felt, like i was going to die if i stayed there. My whole body reacted. Fight or flight sounds simple, but when youre in it, and your body reacts before you get a vote, its a whole different experience. \nI didnt slept that night. My bed felt wrong. I felt unsafe. I kept expecting him to burst through the door and do it again. When i crashed from the exhaustion the next day, i woke up screaming. It happend again, only this time in my mind. I wasnt even safe from him there. I was never diagnosed with PTSD, but i know a flashback when i have them. 30 minutes of sleep i got. Thats all i could get at a time, followed by 3 hours of silently staring into the space around me, trying to shrink myself out of existence, numb but feeling so much, scared, but without the energy to do anything about it. \n\nI got signed  off. I got given a therapist by my new workplace. Theyve been incredible. They are trying so hard, but its been 5, nearly 6 months. I havent finished my probation. My role is at risk of redundancy in the new restructure anyway. Im back there. November is approaching and im facing unemployment again. How do i do this again? How do i deal with this again?! Im 28 and i still live with my parents, my debt managament plan has fallen through, my credit rating is in hell, along with my dreams, and frankly, me. I dont want to live, but i dont want to hurt anyone. I dont want to leave when theres so much to do. I still, despite it all, have and hope, but it just feels like the indomitable human spirit pushing me to persist despite my utter exhaustion and shame. I just cant keep doing this, and no matter what anyone says, i do, truly, feel like a burden.",

So what's the point of suicidality? It would probably be an upgrade cause then I'd at least feel something different. Yet despite this, I am in a nice small town community college, can't stop smoking pot, can't do my homework worth a shit, and I can't find anyone to hang out with except this one girl who won't stfu about her bf, and a guy named tadley who knows everybody and their mother and is too popular to really spend time with. I lost my job cause I'm too apathetic, lazy, ADHD, young, gay, and mad at the world. I know this is all temporary, yet  the silence of life in its dichotomy with death still feels deafening. I want a girlfriend, or a boyfriend, idrc at this point, but I can't even find a real friend friend. I'm scared of people, but I'm sick being alone all the fucking time. Life is just depresso, I need help figuring out how to study, how to make friends, basically everything except wipe my own ass. All I do is drink coffee and smoke first thing in the morning, days I go to school don't even feel real cause I'm withdrawing. Where do I even start with untangling this mess?",

I just feel completely bad, everyday is a bad day and I am completely unhappy all the time. I never find joy in anything I do anymore and I feel like I'm just passing the time trying to do anything. I feel so apathetic and unhappy. Every social interaction I have is terrible and I always make it terrible and I don't know why. I used to be normal and happy and completely at ease with life and my self. I used to be completely fine but now I'm just doing terrible. I don't know how to get better or how to feel better, I've been on antidepressants, antipsychotics, I've done vaping and alcohol, ive tried so many things. I feel like I overthink. I'm always having a bad day. I'm never feeling like myself, I don't feel like I'm in the moment, I feel like I'm constantly in my head, I feel like my mind is constantly against my best interest and making my life a living hell, I feel like I ruin everything, I feel like I ruin every good thing, I feel like I'm going crazy. I feel like nothing can help me because I am always getting worse everyday. I feel like I can't trust my thoughts and emotions anymore. I just feel so terrible. I don't feel like myself anymore. I just feel so dissatisfied and disappointed with myself. I have no friends, no relationships, my family and I think I'm weird and my family thinks something is wrong with me and I do too but I dont know what it is. I've been to psych Wards in the past. I just feel so weird and strange like I feel lost but I know exactly where I am. I feel like I'm high but I havent taken any drugs. People think I'm high all the time. I feel so weird and just not like myself anymore and I hate it. When I think of death I feel relieved because I feel like I can be free of everything that bothers me such as being the person and being the way I am now. I wish I felt normal and alive again. I just feel so weird and strange. I feel like I don't know what's happening anymore. My mind isn't as sharp such as I can't read anymore because I read something and it feels like I read nothing at the same time. Nothing registers in my brain normal and properly anymore probably due to depression. I am 22 and still living with my parents because I cannot get my shit together and I feel like shit. I feel like I ruin everything which makes me want to seclude myself. I feel like and I know I can't do anything right anymore. I feel like a failure and I feel like I deserve to die.

I was set up to fail my entire life and all I continue to do is fail. Everyone tells me I need to help myself before they will help me but how does one do that without any experience or prior knowledge and having 0 real support structure and a family that is so disconnected from reality with multiple disabilities or disorders. I definitely have some underlying conditions that were never treated because my family just had way to many issues going on for be to even matter. Or the mass use of drugs around the family.I’m pretty sure I have ADHD and some strange god complex/narcissism because I view the vast majority of people i see as npc’s. Which only have 2 options of diagalog. \n\nI’ve wasted more than half my life playing video games at a really high level but have nothing to show for it except self bragging rights and a plethora of gaming knowledge that seems useless or wasted right now.\nI hate people in general because it feels like nobody understands me or even wants to try to understand why I say act or feel the way I do.\n\nThe nights are continuing to get harder and harder and I feel more alone than ever. I have a very lovely and innocent girlfriend who I’ve been with for 13 years and I’m sick of holding her back and not being able to fully help or provide for here disability needs and or wants. I haven’t had a job in years due to prior bad work history and a sense of dread and fear about getting a job that will only make me worse or I am scared of the huge change that will happen.\n\nI grew up incredibly poor and have never bought my self anything as I’m always robbing Peter to pay Paul or paying my girlfriend back for holidays or trips I don’t even wanna go on. I have 0 savings and live benefit check to benefit check.\nI’m a stain on this world and I only wish I had the balls to off myself but I’m too cowardess to do even do that. \n\nI’m sick of crying myself to sleep or being so unable to sleep that I have to push my body to the point of exhaustion with a 30 hour+ awake session. Every time I try to reach out I feel like nobody is taking me seriously. That it’s all just a joke to them or that I’m playing it off for attention. My cries for go unheard. Or when they do get heard people always talk down to me or are really condescending. \n\nThank you if you managed to get this far down or for even checking out my post and having the patience to read these ramblings.\nI apologise for any incorrect language, punctuation or grammar I’m basically self taught everything. \n\nIf you’re out there and you’re suffering too, just know you’re not alone. I’m right there with ya.\n\nI hope yall have a wonderful day/night or morning and I’ll try my best to do the same.",

      "selftext": "I suffer from recurrent depressive disorder with a severe episode for a while now (code F33.2). I live with it for over 20 years but it was never a big problem and did not really affect me in everyday life until around april this year i started feeling that something is going really wrong, i couldn't tell what it was and what triggered it and still i am not sure about it.  I just started to feel really really bad. First it was just a mood i thought. It became worse with every day, then with every second. After around one month in i was restless all day all night. I couldn't relax i couldn't even just sit down for a minute to stay calm, couldn't sleep for 4 full days and nights at the worst. I started crying out of nothing because harmless every day stuff triggered me. 2 months in i went to the doctor and asked for help. I got some medicine and i am in therapy since then. I got an inpatient treatment recommended but i didn't wanted it. I had my little family and my job. 3 months in my family and my job was gone. Everything has slipped away from me and i couldn't do anything against it. I literally lost my whole life starting with zero. 4 months in and after getting a sick note and a new apartment, things seemed to get better as changing my residence got all of my attention and finally i could focus on something again. 5 months in that was completed and i started to suffer from loneliness above all. Suicidal thoughts i had from the beginning but for most of the time i never planned to actually end things because i still have goals in my life and ambitions. At first i wanted to keep my family together but i failed. I had a job with much responsibility and even got promoted shortly before everything went down the hill. After all that was gone i did set new goals. Finally losing weight because i have to deal with my fat body for all my life now, trying to date again to find someone who ends that loneliness. And above all trying to fix the relationship with my child, that got damaged during the breakup. I failed with all of that too even though i still want to fight i slowly have the feeling that i gave up. I lost hope and faith, and i don't have the feeling that i can do the turnaround anymore. I am a complete wreck. I can't concentrate on nothing, i can't think clearly, millions of thoughts in my head all the time, i fear the future as i don't see anything good crossing my way, it's not that i want to die but the burden of life getting harder with every day and the point where i can't take it anymore was reached a long time ago. I tried so hard for all my life to be a good boy and to get along well, i worked my ass off, no matter what i did, things never went the way i wanted them. It got too much. I tried getting help. I visit therapy, group therapy, i take pills, i went to 2 different psychiatrists, i answered around thousands of questions to get diagnosed, i share every private detail of my life with people, i try to socialise again but i don't have many friends and the few i have also have to deal with their own problems. Also there is no contact with my parents or so, i have literally no one, except my depression and i don't know that i could do to cure it or at least live with it without being affected too much. I fear i have to live like that for the rest of my life, and i don't want that. It's really not like I'm not trying, i give my best like i did for all my life even though i made many mistakes. Please just tell me what can i do, how can i leave this hell behind me to have something like a normal life again with moments i can enjoy.  I can't take this anymore, it's too painful.\n\nI am thankful for every advise you can give me. Sorry for my bad English btw it's not my main language  ",

I could talk about how I self harmed again, how my dad's basically a predator, how my mom's crazy and how many guys my sisters been with and that she told me the sexual history of all of them but I don't want to anymore. Everyone always lets me down. Wether it's my \"friends\", school or church, I genuinely don't deserve to be alive. I'm getting things I don't even want, being someone people vent to and I'm tired of hearing adults complain. It's probably selfish, but I don't care as much. Stop telling kids your problem and get your own help. Don't have kids if you can't support yourself and them. Stop bringing people in this world, it's horrible. I thought I could be \"useful\" or make some people happy by giving things away and I'm glad they used me, but I still don't feel happy. Hanging out outside, in church, in my bed, it's useless. It's never \"enough\". I just want somebody to rely on for once. I don't wanna be relied on, I want to be tolerated for all I am, not just for crying.\n\n\nWhat's so complicated about not understanding \nGod?? All I said was \"I'm not Christian but I have faith in God, I'm not scared of being kidnapped\" and I was told \"Your braincell is so small.\" Aren't we supposed to have faith?? This isn't a sarcastic answer it's what I'm trying to explain, and then you say I \"do too much\" for backing my answer with evidence. Isn't the whole point of being \"Christian\" is having faith in God? Why are you so scared of something that probably won't happen, if you had faith wouldn't you actually agree? I want to practice some ideas of God/the Bible and other religions but my family is always hating me because I question and explore religions. People are so dumb, people are so guiliable and annoying. I hate people around me, I hate how nice they can be and then annoy me. What am I supposed to do? Pray to God? Pray and pray to someone who I can't even hug? Someone I can't even hold. I just want to leave. I don't want to live.",

I wish I could go back in time to comfort and advise my childhood self to get some help before my mental health got worse.\n\nWhen I was around 10-11, I had a teacher called Miss P. She worked with me for two years, back to back grades. At the time, I was experiencing a difficult home life. The only real friend I had at school transferred. Over the course of my time with her, school became very difficult for me. I had a hard time keeping up with homework, couldn’t understand new material, and I was overall very standoff. One day, she asked me to stay late a minute to talk. The first thing she asked me was if I was okay. I remember sobbing instantly, starting to shake, and trying to mutter the words that I’m fine.\n\nI’ve thought about that a lot recently. Miss P was the only one I can remember to take the time to reach out to me. She saw the signs, and she knew that something was wrong. I wish I would have said something to her then - maybe I would have received help to prevent where I am now. I wish I could tell the younger version of myself that those big feelings were not normal, that I could tell someone, and that it was okay to just need a hug. I wish I told Miss P what was going on in my undeveloped, confused little mind.",

I'm bisexual, addicted to meth, I have 7 diagnosed mental illnesses including depression which I have had since the age of 11. I've essentially been depressed my entire life, or near as makes no difference. It's never gotten better, not even a little bit.. my life has just been a steady decline into misery, hate, sadness and pain. I'm used to it, I know how to live with it, I lie... I lied to my friends (which all went away, because of my choices, I don't have friends anymore) I lie constantly to my family (who try to help but they really dont know how.. I don't think they can actually), and most of all I lie to myself... it's an agreement I have between.. um myself? (That sounded weird..) I lie that I am ok, that this is temporary and it will eventually get better, that I can fix this, that there is hope for my future... I know I'm lying, I know deep down.. but I pretend not to because if I didn't I wouldn't be able to function. I'm at a point in my life where I can't pretend anymore.. which I think is actually good, living like that isn't healthy.. living like this is not healthy... but I've been living a lie for sooo long.. I don't know if a real me exists anymore... I've searched myself and looked and thought and.. there's nothing there. Just an unlife built upon lies and an emptyness beyond it that scares me so much all I want to do is deny it's existence and flee from it... but I think that's all I have.. all I have left of my true self, and I don't know which is worse, to exist as a fiction or to not exist at all. I'm terrified... and alone.. and I dont know what to do. I don't know how to live, and I really don't to die.. and I'm afraid I'm going to.. I'm afraid I've never been alive in the first place... I really don't know what I should do and I need help but I can't ask for it because I don't know the right words to convey how I feel, I don't know if they exist either. And most of all I hope that I actually am broken.. because that means there is a chance I might be able to fix me.. but I'm afraid.. that this is just who I am, that I'm not broken at all and I'm just.. like this. \n\nTldr: I'm terrified, and alone, and I don't know what I should do, and I need help... \n\nI don't even really know why I'm posting this, I think I just needed to tell someone, anyone what's going on. \n\nThanks for listening.

I'd doze off during classes, cheat on exams and assignments, ditch homework to hang out with my friends, and pull all nighters to play video games. It was easy and a lot of fun. I went through school with minimal effort because, let's face it, the system allowed it. Teachers passed you if you just showed up.\n\nFast forward to adulthood and now I have a job where employers expect me to be fully present for every single minute of my shift. No sleeping, no shortcuts, no “just getting by”. I work my ass off just to cover rent, groceries, and the basics, with nothing left over for the simple joys that used to define my days.\n\nThis brutal shift has put me into extreme depression. School was supposed to teach me how to function, but instead, it enabled a version of me that's unprepared for the world. I feel like a fraud every day, faking competence. \n\nHas anyone else gone through this? How do you bridge that gap between the kid who could wing it and the adult who's barely holding it together?",

I’ve applied to dozens of positions that align with my skills and values, made it through interviews, and then been ghosted or rejected.

Now I’m not so sure. What happens when the ideals that once gave you strength become the very things that make you feel alienated and broken?

      "title": "I'm at a breaking point and don't really know what to do",
      "selftext": "So this is a hard one for me, as I've never admitted to something like this online.\n\nSince it may be relevant later, I have to mention that I live in Germany and am around 28-32 years old.\n\nI studied law here. Here, law is a bit different to other countries. You don't have a Bachelor-Master system. You have state examina and you need to complete 2 to become a judge, a prosecutor or an attorney for example (it's valuable). The first examina takes about 5 years and is completed in an university setting, but is mostly worthless commercially (it's just a diploma basically).\n\nThe second one takes about 3 years to finish and includes multiple practical stations that take a few months each (helping a lawyer, judge etc.). The finishing exams for both are hard, but the one for the second one are horror. They last 2 weeks and have 8 exams with totally different and random contents that take 5 hours each.\n\nWhen I started the education for the 2nd exam, a lot of bad things happened. Someone close to me died and so on. So I started to hate what I did and entered the worst spiral of depression for about 4 or 5 years. This has rendered me mostly unable to learn what I need to learn as each time I try to learn anything law related, I feel incredibly unhappy. I have tried to fix this with psychotherapy, but it doesn't really seems to work. And I tried to to do something else for about a year, but I had to get back, because there is a maximum limit for how long you can take a break from the prep time for the 2nd exam. If there wouldn't be, I would have done something else for 10 years or so and everything probably would've been fine. But my hand was forced, because of the maximum time limit - after which the exams are evaluated as \"failed forever\" - even if you have never attempted to even write it.\n\nNow I'm writing them, but of course I'm less than suboptimally prepared. Of course, the exams go badly. And each day, I'm more devastated, broken and suicidal. I'm trying to convince myself, that I will get 7 months to prepare for the retrial, but I don't think I will do much better because of my depression. I'm crying each time I come home and before every exam. It hurts having to hide my feelings in front of others who do so fine.\n\nAnd I've done nothing else the past years. I've sacrificed everything. I don't have any close friends. Before I reentered the 2nd exam prep, I partially lived by social security payments (while trying to work/learn from 7 to 23) so I'm pretty poor. I don't have a relationship. I wasn't on holiday at all for the past... I don't even remember. I only leave my home to buy groceries or go to different doctors now, because I was scared of being judged for living off social security - although I probably tried to work more hours per day than I would on normal job - even on the weekends. I don't have a pet. I feel incredibly alone. The only people who I have left to stabilize me each day are my parents who have to visit me daily now. And I see all the people around me being happy. Seemingly having easy relationships, pets, money, jobs, marrying, having kids... And even when they have the same problems as me, they seem to be able to at least find relationships with supporting partners so easily. I don't. Dating apps suck. But even when I just try to start a normal chat with a girl my age, the face expression just says pity and/or disinterest so I've given up on that, but still converse kindly and courteously of course. After all, they're human and I understand that nobody has interest in a broken guy (so I'm not angry, but sad). I just wish I at least had a relationship with someone who understands depression where you can support each other. I tried to find self-help groups for depression in my city, but couldn't find any.\n\nWith this happening each day and my condition seemingly worsening each day, I have come to the conclusion that I probably will have to give up my dream of ever becoming a lawyer, stop torturing myself (at least after finishing these exams) and look for something else if I don't want to up in a psychiatric hospital forever, have a heart attack or kill myself.\n\nHas anyone done something like that? Just switched careers and looked for something else? What was your experience? How did you do it? Did it help or did letting go of your dream make your life make a turn for the worse? Is there a place where you can be given good advice on how to find a different, fitting job for you in Germany?\n\nI hope I find the will to survive this week and the next to read your answers. But I doubt anyone even bothers to read this pathetic wall of text that probably doesn't make any sense anyway. If anyone finds the energy and kindness to answer, please have a big piece of my heart and a heartfelt thank you!",

We both turned 30 this year and have both struggled with depression and anxiety for the majority of our lives. He (I'll call him T) was in an emotionally abusive relationship for close to 10yrs when I met him. Before me all of his relationships were him taking care of others and no one ever taking care of him or showing him unconditional love (including his parents).\n\nI have my own issues and traumas that have caused me to internalize everything that happens and blame myself, I also have abandonment issues stemming from childhood.\n\nAfter our baby was born (literally the week of) T started to experience a depressive episode. I know that it's common for fathers to also experience post partum depression, however that wasn't the problem. T got to spend 2 weeks home with us and during that time he became more and more withdrawn, until eventually he wasn't touching me or kissing me goodbye. When I brought this up because I was starting to feel alone, T told me that he felt like he cannot be a good partner right now and then he said he was not able to feel feelings of affection or love for me. He does not want me to hug or touch him, he says he is uncomfortable with being comforted and doesn't think he deserves it. At this point he has said we are not together but we are a team for our child no matter what happens.\n\nBecause of my past and my own traumas (I am going back to therapy for support) I feel as if I am being abandoned again and that he doesn't love me at all anymore. Now I would like to say that we were intending to get married within the next year or so, this man is still my best friend and if it's not him, I am not interested in another romantic relationship. But how do I not take this personally and how do I move forward with everything he has said to me?",

I think I would be just the same miserable. The thing I am most afraid is that all of this is just me, that I have been born with this problem and never will change, I continue my life without any thought just always going with the flow, I feel very dissociated of everything friend, family all.\nI wish there was a magic pill to be normal but thats impossible.",

I was in my garden screaming and crying, kicking, ripping my hair, slamming shit. I am so angry, but the thing isn’t it doesn’t just feel like angry. It’s all consuming, it’s this burning rage in my chest that doesn’t settle. I start to hysterically cry, scream and laugh, slamming things around and then just left my house. I cried and lightly cut up my arm. I needed to feel something stronger than the rage in my chest. No matter how hard I pressed my keys against my skin, how hard I tried dipping my hair, nothing compared to the feeling of rage. I wanted someone to hit me, hard so hard I forget the rage and just feel pain. I wanted to kill myself. This is never going to get better. I feel insane. I can’t control and cope with how strong these emotions feel. I want to hang myself. I tried overdosing a few times and never worked. I’m sick of it and I need something that will work. I want this pain to go away, I want the emotions to go away, they are too intense and I can’t keep up. No one understands, everyone just keeps telling me to go to therapy and take my meds but they aren’t working. It’s been 6/7 years of struggling and it’s only getting worse. I am getting worse and I don’t think I’ll make it to 25.",

No thoughts, no opinions, no interest, no engagement. Just emptiness. I can’t think fast or say anything meaningful. When I do talk, it comes out awkward, incoherent, irrelevant.

It’s just silence inside.\n\nI’ve been in therapy for two sessions, but I still feel like I’m suffocating every day. I can’t quit because I need the job to survive, but staying feels like I’m losing myself more and more.\n\nHas anyone felt this kind of total shutdown and managed to come out of it?

I constantly blame myself for everything and end up cutting myself. I’ve tired to stop but my mind keeps telling me to do it again.I’ve have thoughts of ending this all but I chose not to just because I could not let go of something I care for.

      "selftext": "I think that death is definitely the answer. I genuinely cannot think of something else that is freeing. I can't believe that I hit such a deep point just bc of my grades. I'm in a new school, it's known to be difficult. I just got my report card. And I just started school. I'm already failing in 2 classes, physics and biology ; 13% and 20%. I'm genuinely SO ashamed. How can a human be so fucking retarded? Genuinely how can I be so stupid. And tbh, my physics teacher can't fucking explain. My death letters WILL contain his name a minimum of 18 times. I hate him so bad. And today I told my titular that he can't explain bc he usually teaches in grades above. She told me that I'm making excuses. Her name WILL be written at least 58 times. I'm genuinely not laughing. Biology is definitely just my fault, but I genuinely don't understand bc I have 3.5/26. I looked at the evaluation and I don't necessarily see anything wrong. I gave an answer to every question. And I studied AND THAT'S THE FUCKING PROBLEM IS THAT I STUDIED, I ACTUALLY PUT IN THE EFFORT JUST TO GET 13%?????? And there's another girl who has very good grades, and guess what I heard her say? \"I don't even study\" SHUT THE ACTUAL FUCK. YOU NEED TO DIE. I think it's NECESSARY for me to die at this point. Usually, I just need to look at things that make me happy to get immediately better but now I genuinely can't get up from this low point. I feel so retarded. And the fact is, I don't get the motivation to study, I never have, I don't get school stress. I don't feel the need to study, I don't want to. You could paper cut me every five seconds that I don't study. I would have still never gotten up and studied. I could have 1000 paper cuts and STILL NOT CARE. I hate myself so fucking bad how can you be so stupid. I'm so retarded PLEASE KILL ME. You can't convince me that there's another way to live my life, \"grades aren't everything\" right.. like the idea that money isn't everything? Anyone who says bullshit like that is either smart or has enough money to buy 5 island, give them to people and still not lose 1% of their net worth. Grades are infact everything. And I hate it cuz retarded people like me will not survive.  I can already imagine my mom screaming at me bc of my grades, and also because I redid the grade (I didn't redo a grade YET). I genuinely want to try to study, and RN I'm going to try and study, give it all ONE LAST CHANCE. Cuz other wise their will be no other way but death. I never understood people who said that, now that I'm one them, I've never felt so understood. I also will hire a tutor but genuinely, I've never felt so low and I just can't help but cry. How pathetic is that? Who cries bc of their grades. Btw, I got a 0.5/12 in physics. I also filled ALL the questions. I finished like 20 minutes before anyone, (I arrived late, and the worst is that we had 40 minutes. I was 10 minutes late. I spent 10 minutes on it. TEN FUCKING MINUTES.) everytime I finish before anyone does and I always have THE lowest grade. I already imagine myself hanging off the ceiling. Guess what the teacher told me ? \"Put in a little effort\" Are you fucking kidding me? Are you actually joking? I was gonna stab him, me and the rest of my classmates because I genuinely was about to go berserk. I cannot stand his face. Math, same exact thing. I finish a minimum of 10 minutes before anyone else does. The only grades I'm not failing, are linguistics. I'm not even that good in languages 💔 I'm also going to fail sport lol. I need to get a fucking grip but I can't help but lose concentration. I can't even get diagnosed with anything. Thanks 💓. ",

I feel like nothing makes sense anymore and that there’s no point for me to live, I probably haven’t gone out of my house for around 3 months now\n\n\nthis mainly started because I have hyperhidrosis (REALLY bad hyperhidrosis) and that made me literally not go out all summer because of how bad it was and how much it depressed me (yes I know it’s a stupid reason but when you don’t live with it you can’t really know how horrible it is) \n\n\nand it’s still affecting me a lot, but before I always was like “I wanna go out” and “maybe when I get some medication for this I’ll even go outside everyday”\n\n\nNow I just don’t want to do anything anymore? It’s like it sucked the life out of me, I don’t go out, I don’t want to go out, I don’t dress up, I don’t speak with anyone besides my mother..\n\nEverytime I get up, it feels like my body weights so much that it exhausts me a lot to even stand up, I can’t even get myself to do my hair bro it’s exhausting everything makes me tired\n\nI go to sleep exhausted, I wake up tired, I eat, go to the bathroom and sleep again, I don’t do more in my day. \n\nI have no idea what’s going on with me? I don’t want to keep living and that’s all I can think about, but I know I won’t do anything about it \n\nI’ve had arguments with my mom about this before, (I’m 15) and she just begs me to go out at this point, but I really fucking can’t lol I don’t know what is going on with me I wish I would want to live again and I wish I wouldn’t be stressed all the time and I just wish I could be a normal teenager and I wish I could go outside and see my friends but everything just annoys me and exhausts me so much ",

I only have 3 family members left and they are all heavy smokers and getting old. I know when they are gone I’ll have nobody my myself and my thoughts. My dad died last year and his whole side of the family doesn’t care about me and live out of state. \n\nI’ve almost lost everything. Why keep living when I know things will get worse? Why keep living when I know my misery is only going to increase as time goes on? I’m about to graduate with tons of debt with no job prospects, I also am about to lose my health insurance with no job. It was a mistake to go to RIT for IT work because nobody wants to hire me and now I’m broke. There is literally 0 reason for me to keep living other than to prevent my mom from having to deal with my debts. \n\nThe only thing that gives me even modicum of joy is video games and those now have lost most of their fun because I have no friends anymore. When I was in high school, I was happy and had a nice friend group. Now 6 years later I’m miserable and about to commit suicide, funny how things change like that. ",

      "selftext": "My husband and I had to put our cat down about a month and a half ago. It was extremely hard. He had gotten sick a few months before, and I was giving him IV’s and medicine and taking him to the vet every month. He just progressively got worse until we had to make the hardest decision, knowing he was in pain.\n\nMy husband and his family got this cat when my husband was in high school and then we ended up adopting him about 7 years ago. He was our child; our everything. His death was devastating for us.\n\nMy husband had made the comment a few weeks ago that he wanted to adopt a new cat or two soon because it felt so lonely at our house. Which it has. The cat was my companion. He was always laying with me, following me around the house, just a constant presence. I’m a homebody so I never cared if I was home alone because I always had our cat. Now that he’s gone, the loneliness is unbearable.\n\nI’ve slowly been going through the process of grieving, but I learned recently that my husband is still struggling. My husband suffers from depression, and it can be really debilitating. He recently started suffering again and he made the comment that any time he’s alone at work, he just thinks of our cat sick and remembers how he looked on the day we had to put him down which has caused him to miss a lot of work. In his mind, he thinks of our cat as healthy and that our cat deserved to live longer which of course he did. In a perfect world, pets would outlive us. But I know just how in pain and miserable he was. I was in the room when we put our cat down and those images will forever be with me, so I understand where he comes from. It’s so hard to forget those negative memories. And seeing his cat tree, and different beds around the house was just a constant reminder that he’s gone. We moved the cat tree and beds, which I’m hoping helps.\n\nMy husband has suffered from depression since he was a teenager, it’s something that’s come and gone for our entire relationship but recently it’s been way more often. He just recently agreed to start taking medication, he just hasn’t started taking it yet. So, I’m hoping that’s a good step in the right direction.\n\nBut I just don’t know what to do. Part of me wonders if we should look at adopting a new cat. It could give my husband something to focus on and love and fill the emptiness in our house. But I also worry that it’s too soon and could bring up negative feelings, like we're trying to replace. I am very aware of his depression and have done a lot of research which means I know his brain can interpret things different than mine, so I don't want to do something to upset him.\n\nWould suggesting adopting a cat help? Or should I just wait for him to bring it up?\n\nAny advice from someone who has or hasn't adopted while depressed is greatly appreciated 😊",

I wish my parents could understand that I am struggling so freaking much and I don’t need to be “severely traumatized” by a physical situation in order for my struggle to be valid.
