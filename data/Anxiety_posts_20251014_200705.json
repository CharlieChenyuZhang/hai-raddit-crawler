      "selftext": "So tomorrow night I‚Äôm taking my first ever international flight to Italy. I am sooo nervous because the longest flight I‚Äôve ever been on was 3 hours and 40 minutes, and this flight will be 8 hours and 40 minutes. It‚Äôs been my dream since I was a kid to visit Italy, because it‚Äôs where my grandmother was born. I hate how my anxiety is distorting my thoughts into thinking this is something dangerous and not amazing. I have a bag packed of a bunch of things to ensure I‚Äôm comfortable, and I did get anxiety meds from my doctor. I still don‚Äôt feel prepared, and I was wondering if anybody on this subreddit had any helpful advice? It would definitely help to hear other people‚Äôs stories about how they pushed through it. I‚Äôm ruminating on all of the worst case scenarios and getting stuck in them. I am sooo nervous that I‚Äôll be in the sky and start to panic, and I usually go outside for fresh air to ground myself and that‚Äôs obviously not possible during the flight. I am trying so hard not to freak out because in the past, I have backed out of trips and cancelled my flight due to this feeling. I was supposed to fly out to Kentucky a few months ago to visit family and decided last minute I felt safer at home. I know that I really need to push myself and do this, but the anxiety is still there. üò©",

      "selftext": "hiii. so i know im spiraling, but i just want to vent. so pls be aware this is going to be lonnnggg. \nso, im 28f and currently unemployed. last year i quit my job of four years to pursue my dream of living abroad for a year. i got back to the US in June and since then i‚Äôve been applying to jobs ‚Äî with no luck. at first, I was applying to full-time jobs that catered more towards my career, so anything social services related. however, after a few months of not hearing back from anyone, I ended up applying to any part-time jobs.  still no luck. I think after a while I started to go down the rabbit hole of justifying getting a masters in psychology. i was like ‚Äúhmm maybe i‚Äôm not getting these jobs bc im not qualified‚Äù or ‚Äúill prob have more chances landing a career with my masters‚Äù.\nanyways, jump forward to this month I decided to apply to two masters program in psychology. I finished my personal statement and reached out to professors to see if they can write me a letter of rec. \nso, last week i FINALLY received an email from a part-time retail store asking for a zoom interview. i was super excited because finally someone got back to me and the store I love! i just finished my interview and I don‚Äôt think it went the best. I automatically felt my voice shaky, i felt like my answers could‚Äôve been better, and i can sense that they can sense i was nervous! i absolutely had this feeling :( but overall, I made it known that i can see the store emphasize having a welcoming and warm community for their employees and their customer & that I just wanted to be part of a community that works that way. I also mentioned that I was a team player. \none question did cut me off guard, the store does have a membership card and they asked me how would I go about selling these memberships? I was honest and I said that sometimes when I go to the store, I can see that some of the employees repeatedly asked the customers after they say no, making it feel force. I said that if I worked there, I would probably just ask the customer once or twice and if they say no, I wouldn‚Äôt push it. I hope they don‚Äôt jot down a point for that.\n\nso, now I‚Äôm post-interview and I know I‚Äôm overthinking this but i just feels so shitty because I hate it how unease i felt through the interview. i didn‚Äôt like how my voice was shaky, i sounded like I was out of breath and just nervous. I know this is a normal human response and I know I might be too hard on myself, but I can‚Äôt help these thoughts just coming to my mind. And now I‚Äôm thinking about grad school, some programs require you to do interviews with the faculty and now I‚Äôm dreading that. I just feel like an imposter and like I don‚Äôt belong in these spaces (both university & a retail store)!! ugghhh. \n\nI just needed to let this out & would really appreciate any words of encouragement from the ppl of the internet.

My boyfriend struggles with really severe anxiety, and I care about him deeply. He‚Äôs been through a lot, and I always try to be patient and supportive. His parents often tell me they think I‚Äôm very wise and empathetic for my age, and that they appreciate how much I help him stay grounded. But lately, that‚Äôs started to feel like a double-edged sword.\n\nWhenever he goes through a bad anxiety episode or has to adjust his medication, he sometimes falls behind in school. When that happens, his parents tend to use me as a sort of motivation or even a punishment. They‚Äôll make him cancel our plans last minute or say he can‚Äôt see me until he‚Äôs ‚Äúdoing better‚Äù again. I know they mean well, and I understand they‚Äôre trying to encourage him, but it‚Äôs starting to make me feel more like a reward or kind of a resource or a tool more than his actual girlfriend.\n\nIt‚Äôs complicated because I really love him, and I don‚Äôt want to make things harder. I can see how much pressure he‚Äôs under, and I know his parents are just trying to help. But it‚Äôs also hard not to feel hurt or a little objectified by the way I‚Äôm being used in all of this. They see me as mature and empathetic, but I‚Äôm still figuring out how to handle situations like this.\n\nHas anyone else been in a situation like this where you‚Äôre trying to support someone with severe anxiety, but their family ends up involving you in ways that make you uncomfortable? Should I talk to him about how I feel, or would it be better to just stay quiet if it seems to help him stay motivated",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone.\nI‚Äôve been dealing with chronic tension and pain in my upper back for about six months now. It all started after a stretching exercise, but my doctor said that‚Äôs not the only reason.\n\nI used to have a very active, physical job, and then suddenly switched to a sitting one. I wasn‚Äôt working out, carried heavy bags, and on top of that - had a lot of stress, anxiety, fear, overthinking, and crying. My doctor believes all of this together led to a constant muscle spasm.\n\nThey told me I need to very slowly start strengthening my body - really slowly - but life happens, and sometimes stressful situations come up that I can‚Äôt avoid. Then the pain flares up again. It‚Äôs been this cycle for months: a bit of progress, then stress, then my back tightens up again.\n\nI‚Äôve realized my anxiety and constant feeling of danger might be what‚Äôs keeping my body stuck like this. My muscles never really relax - it feels like my back is always ‚Äúon guard.‚Äù\n\nRecently I started reading The Anxiety Therapy book, but most of the examples there are about specific fears, like fear of blood or public speaking. My anxiety is different - I can barely fall asleep because I keep imagining someone breaking into my door, or that a war will start and I won‚Äôt be able to handle it with my back pain.\n\nHas anyone experienced this kind of mind-body connection?\nHow do you calm your nervous system and teach your body that it‚Äôs safe again?\n\nAny books, techniques, or personal experiences would really help. \n",

The reason im making this post is because i need advice on how to become a more open person regarding social interactions as im very bad at speaking to people. This is sorta ruining my life at the moment as sometimes i dont attend soccer practise or my education as im worried about (i dont even know actually im just worried for what feels like no reason) i feel this has become serious enough as im having panic attacks through the night which is really fucking up my sleep pattern and making me tired throughout the day also ever since i started this course i havent been eating really at all (which my mom keeps telling me its really bad especially how i play soccer every day) and to add to that about my mom i dont feel like i can talk to anyone in my family about this and i cant talk to any friends about this as i dont have any. \n\nSometimes i feel its because I haven't cried in a while and ill think to myself i need to just cry and let it all out but i just cant, i try to, but its like there are no tears left. \n\nIm feeling really bad about this whole situation and didnt know what to do about it so here i am \n\nIve just started a new course where i play soccer and study for a diploma. The education side of the program is fine and i think its started pretty well however the social side of things has completely diminished any happiness i get from the education. Its not because anyone has done anything mean or anything like that everyone has been pretty chill. Its just i feel i overthink things but i dont know lile theres some situations where i feel confident and happy and then some situations where i feel like people try to avoid me because they dont wanna talk to me but i haven't done anything to anyone. This is really affecting me is soccer practice aswell because im cant focus and make dumb mistakes i cant pass the ball well wuth this hanging over my head i cant shoot i cant do any of the things i could normally. There are so many things i wanna say but i dont know how to say them so im gonna leave it there for now any help woyld be dearly appreciated as im sorta losing my will to live here.\n\nPs sorry about the awful grammar its 10 oclock and i cba to smarten  it up cause maybe no one will ever see this ",

This initially only happened a few times a month but over the last few years can happen as many as several times a day, depending on the day. Not really sure what triggers them but since this past week, I‚Äôve been getting them during exercise and they‚Äôve caused some amount of physical pain, which is very new on both counts. \n\nNow whether it‚Äôs due to the exercise itself or anxiety I‚Äôm not sure, since I‚Äôve mostly gotten the painful ones when I‚Äôve unexpectedly come across another person while I‚Äôm out walking my dog for example. I do have bad social anxiety but it hasn‚Äôt caused my heart to painfully skip beats in the past. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôll get this sudden stoppage of my heart that sends a squeezing pain that I‚Äôll feel shoot all the way into my back. I‚Äôve been to doctors for about my heart palpitations and even the emergency once within the past year and was given a clean bill of health after an EKG, bloodwork, etc. My PCP has suggested I may be experiencing PVCs. The fact that they‚Äôre getting so intense as to cause these little painful pulses is odd. Has anyone else had pain accompany otherwise harmless PVCs or other palpitations? ",

Whenever I make a mistake I get a thigh feeling in my chest and it feels harder to breath. I cry easily and I am scared. So scared that I can‚Äôt always sleep. Thankfully my brother was there to calm me down. I always need someone to tell me it‚Äôs okay, else I will get crazy and in the worst case not sleep till the mistake is fixed which is mostly impossible because it‚Äôs already in the past. Whenever I tell myself it‚Äôs okay it‚Äôs never working I seem to feel more anxious. Dies anyone have any Tipps on how to change that. I doesn‚Äôt even matter if it‚Äôs a small or big mistake I always react the same. I just can‚Äôt seem to calm down when I make a mistake. I hate it. I feel like a failure and I think like I made everything worse again. I‚Äôd like some Tipps on how to deal with it on short notice, if anyone has any suggestions. Thankss",

I feel like my health is worsening and I can‚Äôt enjoy my life or life in the moment because I‚Äôm always reminiscing about the past when I was 13/14. \nI know I‚Äôm still young and 16 is not old at all but it seems like every birthday I get more and more stressed out. I just wanna be a kid again where I barely had to worry about anything and play with my toys or whatever. \n\nI also freak out because I feel like when I talk to kids younger than me I feel too old and that I can‚Äôt relate to them and Its weird to me tht how when you were looking at kids that are your age currently when you were younger, they seemed so grown up but now actually getting to that age u realise the were not grown at all. \n\nIdk if 16 is supposed to be an adult or still a child like idk. I miss being a kid where there was more opportunities and the world seemed more open and I could be an astronaut or famous singer or whatever but now I‚Äôm actually getting to the age where I‚Äôm realising I have to be more realistic about life and it‚Äôs not exciting anymore. \n\nNothing excites me like it did as a kid and the world just seems so boring and depressing now. I cant enjoy things like a used to and idk what to do, is this what being an adult is like? Is this what my adult like will feel like? I have also been experiencing extremely dark thoughts recently of doing something to myself or doing things to myself but thankfully it‚Äôs just thoughts and not me actually carrying those thoughts out, but at this rate I think I might soon. \n",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone, I wanted to tell my story. \nI am a 20 year old boy who attend economics university in Italy.\n\nI had my first panic attack in March, during uni class. I was truly afraid of dying, and I truly believed it, for the first time in my life. \nFrom that moment on, without realizing it, I started attending less often that class at that precise time, but I didn't know that the worst was yet to come. \n\nAt the end of May/beginning of June, the beginning of the exam period, I started to have daily fears for my health: I must have had a heart attack or stroke at least 5/6 times a day.\nAll this was also fueled by the period in which my brother was really ill and his wife didn't understand anything and believed he was creating the disease. A bad time for him. \n\nFrom this moment on, I had a period of strong anxiety and hyper-control of the symptoms which led me to a constant tension and stress which lasts until today, and which does not seem to want to go away even with the best will in the world. I have had panic attacks, which have however gradually reduced, I have been afraid of staying alone at home (even if some days it comes back to me), of taking a simple walk or even of climbing the stairs.\n\nThis, led me to only take 2 out of 3 exams in the summer session.\n\nIn short, without repeating, I had a very bad summer. \n\nNow that university classes have started again, I thought that, by starting over and having a very specific routine again, I would think about all this less. Half wrong: yes, I'm not in the same situation as at the beginning of the summer psychologically, but all the classes I attended were hell. \nAside from the fact that the hours of classes are scandalous, because they force me to stay away from home for up to 13 hours (I don't want to move to the city because it's too close to move but too far to commute and therefore I don't want to spend a lot of money), I was so hot in every class, the classrooms were full of people, I couldn't breathe and my heart was racing. Well, I didn't have a panic attack but I'm worried. And, I realized that I'm avoiding going and preferring to study (but procrastinate, like all summer with the last exam that in the end I didn't do it) at home. \n\nIn the last few days I've been really down, I even thought that the faculty I chose last year wasn't for me, I told myself that all the new exams would suck and that they would be very difficult (even if it's an objective for everyone that they are difficult).\n\nI've tried two psychologists in the past few months, but they weren't for me. I might try a third, one offered by the university. \n\nIf you'd like and can, please say something. I'd love to hear your thoughts. Sorry for the language; I tried to write as correctly as possible in English without a translator.",

My doctor first started me on 10mg, but after 3 weeks it felt like too much ‚Äî I was restless, emotionally flat, and while my anxiety had slightly improved, my arms and legs still felt heavy and jelly-like. I also never got that ‚Äútherapeutic lift‚Äù or sense of calm people talk about, so I decided to drop down to 5mg.\n\nI stayed at 5mg for about 2.5 weeks, but the anxiety was still there, just a little less intense. About a week and a half ago, I decided to go back up to 10mg hoping things would level out ‚Äî but instead, I‚Äôve noticed I actually feel more depressed now. My mood has dipped, I feel emotionally numb, and the jelly-like weakness in my arms and legs hasn‚Äôt gone away. If anything, it sometimes feels worse.\n\nNow I‚Äôm just trying to figure out ‚Äî should I keep pushing through at 10mg and give it more time to really work, or could this be a sign that Lexapro just isn‚Äôt the right med for me?\n\nFor those who‚Äôve found the right medication, did it help with physical anxiety symptoms too ‚Äî like that constant weak or heavy feeling in your arms and legs?\n\nAs I‚Äôm writing this, my neurologist is running more tests ‚Äî they‚Äôre even doing a muscle biopsy to rule things out. Every other test I‚Äôve done so far has come back normal, so I‚Äôm at a loss with these weird muscle sensations.\n\nI was also prescribed propranolol 10mg to help with the physical symptoms, but I‚Äôm not sure if that dose is even enough to make a difference.

However, I have yet to receive a formal response regarding my specific request submitted on October 8th for an additional 30 minutes of administrative time per day.\n\nAdditionally, this ongoing situation‚Äîwith unclear expectations, lack of support, and repeated overdue demands‚Äîhas caused me significant anxiety and stress. This is impacting my ability to focus and perform my duties effectively.\n\nRegarding the Tutor Visitor Sign-In/Out log ‚Äî I was told by you to turn in the sheet when it gets full. I was fully prepared to submit it on time, but I followed that instruction. The expectations have been unclear and inconsistent.\n\nTo be absolutely clear:\n\n* I have done my best to complete the required work under challenging and unclear circumstances.\n* I will not work outside of my scheduled time without compensation.\n* I will not continue repeating the same concerns that have already been documented and ignored.\n* I cannot be held responsible for compliance issues when I have not been provided the resources, time, or clarity needed to fulfill expectations ‚Äî especially when I have already submitted a professional letter requesting accommodations.\n\nPlease let me know:\n\n1.

I'm so used to gossip by now that I don't even realize half the time. I used to gossip and then realized what I was doing and have been trying to stop for the past couple years and have definitely succeeded for the most part.

I asked how long they had been married and he said X amount of time. He started talking about how she told him her partner is lazy and wants kids, but she doesn't. \n\nI said \"sounds like a compatibility issue\" and that was the end of the conversation. My coworker wanted to keep talking about it but the coworker he was talking about walked back in the room. \n\nI obviously should not have indulged this and will try my best not to in the future. I guess my question is, do I need to be as anxious about this as I am? I'm irrationally worried he will tattle even though that doesn't make sense because he brought it up. It's got me stressing and I'm not sure what to do.\n\nWhat should I have done differently to avoid gossiping?

      "selftext": "Ever since about two years ago nothing has felt right. Around that time I developed some stomach issues where eating was difficult due to a constant lump in my throat, and any stressors would trigger me to vomit. This developed over the months, I began eating properly again a few months later, however the issue was now that I was constantly having health anxiety and panic attacks. This is when the brain fog or depersonalization or whatever it is truly struck. It would be so bad during a panic attack, I'd be in a complete daze. This hellishness peaked within the first year when for a full week I was incredibly fatigued, upset stomach and foggy to the point I was unable to do anything productive and incredibly depressed about the point of anything. From there it was a somewhat linear growth towards being less miserable, still getting stressed out over little things, trying counseling, attempting birth control to ease emotions etc. Ever since this became more impactful its been a constant fog, it feels like my peripheral is gone (it isn't), nothing feels as crisp and sharp as it should be. I look in the sky and constantly can see floaters and spots, its like I hyper focus. High stress meant increased foggy fatigued feeling. Tried Escitalopram during the summer, around a year and a half in. Was a relief, had much more energy, the fog didnt fully leave but definantly cleared up quite a bit. Began eating well again. While Escitalopram helped so much I feared becoming dependent off of it and eased off before I began another school year (was on it about a 2 1/2 months). Of course, the school year began stressing me out so I began Escitalopram again after two weeks, this time there has only been relief in toning down the anxiety, the fatigue and brain fog have been nearly debilitating. The most debilitating has occurred recently, a week after a vacation which I was stressed about but honestly, was happy to find that I was able to enjoy more easily than usual. Started my period and suddenly felt like I had all the energy sucked from me, felt anemic almost becuase I was so cold and my heart rate became so low. And the foggy head is crazy, maybe this has been a very heavy period triggered by stress but this brain fog and fatigue has been a breaking point. So incredibly sick of never feeling all right. I've seen the doctor a few times for multiple different ailments, extreme fatigue was ruled out as nothing, stomach issued ruled out as nothing, blood work is clear and physically I am in great shape and work out often. Just trying to push through the last bit of school, would like it better if I could truly enjoy it though!",

My mind is constantly racing, I overthink everything, and I often feel tense or shaky during meetings or calls.\n\nBut when I have a glass of wine in the evening, it‚Äôs like I turn into a completely different person. calm, confident, social, even funny. It‚Äôs honestly amazing how different I feel. Obviously I can‚Äôt drink at work, but I just wish I could feel even 20% like that during the day.\n\nIs there anything (supplement, habit, medication, whatever) that could safely give me that calm, grounded feeling without being harmful or addictive?\n\nNot trying to self-medicate, just wondering if anyone‚Äôs found something that actually helps.",

I already struggle with suicidal thoughts and I do my best to block out as much news as I can. I don‚Äôt want to die but hearing about this gives me less reasons to live. \n\nI‚Äôve tried to communicate my preference to not discuss politics with my friends, but they always tell me it‚Äôs good to stay informed, yet that has never benefited me. Every time I hang out in a group, it always gets brought up and dominates the conversation for the rest of the time while I‚Äôm just awkwardly quiet contemplating why I‚Äôm even there. My main issue is the way it‚Äôs talked about it is overly negative and anxiety provoking often going beyond facts and talking about stuff that hasn‚Äôt even happened. I try to think of the current situation as temporary yet people are making it sound permanent and the end of the world. \n\nI don‚Äôt want to come off as insensitive or ignorant, and I do try to hear people‚Äôs perspectives but I feel like no one is respectful of how it makes me feel. I don‚Äôt tell people it makes me feel suicidal because I don‚Äôt want to guilt-trip, but I really don‚Äôt know what to do other than just avoid my friends which also wouldn‚Äôt help my mental health. \n\nI prefer un-biased political conversations for greater optimism no matter election outcomes, but that is just impossible with my friend group.\n\nAnd no, I don‚Äôt have a therapist because I can‚Äôt afford one, my insurance doesn‚Äôt cover it, and my dad doesn‚Äôt believe in it.

For some kids, it‚Äôs necessary to ‚Äúlevel the playing field‚Äù with medicine in order for your kiddo to truly get some relief.

A bit sore but drugged out of my mind on painkillers. Then I got an infection. I spent one sleepless night from the pain, completely exhausted. Started to feel panicky with a weird feeling in my chest, but went to the dentist to get checked and get antibiotics. That night all hell broke loose. I spent that entire night awake too with my heart beating out of my chest and a feeling of pressure in my chest. Things didn't get better and around noon I snapped and panicked fully, convinced I was having a heart attack. I couldn't calm down my heart no matter what I did, felt like I couldn't breathe, etc. I called an ambulance and they took me to the emergency room around 2 in the afternoon. I spent 6 hours sitting there, waiting while 100% convinced my heart muscle was dying with every second that passed. Finally around 8 or 9 I was seen by a doctor who did an ECG and listened to my heart. He said nothing seemed out of the ordinary but they'd do a blood test to completely reassure me. Of course everything came back normal. Ever since, I've been a wreck. I'm not sleeping well, I'm trying as best as I can to let the waves of panic wash over me. To let my heart beat fast if it has to. Things seem to have very very slightly improved since last week, but MAN THIS IS ROUGH LMAO. I saw my psychologist today and I realised how much trauma I have surrounding death in the family from a very young age. We think this is where a large part of my hypochondria and fear of dying young comes from. I'm on my way to the psychiatrist right now and I temporarily have Xanax to take the edge off for when I feel like I need it. It's absolute hell. I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy.\n\nThe only way out is through <3",

I used an ssri for 2 years to cope with my issues but gradually it stopped working (because I didn't tackle the root cause). Now 12 months ssri free and not planning to return.

It started last friday and I thought I had a reaction to metronidazole because I had soo many symptoms so I stopped mid course on saturday (two doctors told me to). Other side effects disappeared while the air hunger stayed. Its like I need to take a deep breath all the time but I cant get the satisfactory breath like the air hitting bottom of my lungs most of the time, some of you might know what I mean? Also yawning A LOT, but I dont show any other anxiety symptoms to be convinced its anxiety. \n\nBut today I started having sharp pain in my rib while walking, which is most probably muscle issue because it feels superficial yet my health anxiety took it as a sign to drag my butt to urgent care. They werent too concerned until ecg showed something abnormal so they suspected a lung bloodclot!! Waited bloodwork results for 2 hours. No bloodclot and other results normal. Took X-ray. Nothing abnormal! I was sent home with ibuprofen and got told I prolly have asthma? Anyway Shouldnt this be enough of exams to reassure me my symptoms are just anxiety? The breath issue goes away for a while if I focus on something else isnt this a clear sign its just anxiety? WHY do I still feel like there is something wrong why cant I just calm down üòû this is sooo exhausting",

It felt like a perfect match for my interests, and it‚Äôs helped more than I expected. That little moment of excitement when the box arrives each month gives me something to look forward to.\n\nStill, the once-a-month interval leaves a bit of a gap, so I started browsing other online vendors and slowly building out a larger collection. The process of setting up displays, organizing the figures, cleaning them, or just sitting back to appreciate them has become a kind of therapy on its own.\n\nIt helps calm my thoughts and gives me a sense of structure when the anxiety starts creeping in.\n\nHas anyone else here found collecting, whether anime figures or something else, to be helpful for managing anxiety or mental health in general?",

      "selftext": "I recently started to doomscroll on reddit and thought I might post this to see if anyone resonates with me. So I am in my mid-late 30s, don't look like and don't feel like for this age. I have switched jobs and in my mid-late 30s, and finally found a career I absolutely love through a lot of hard works. I stayed with my ex for over 7 years, and he broke up because all the problems we had built up over the years. In addition to that, his family involved way too much in our relationship in a negative way (such as his Mom stood by her son's side as well as his sister. I always felt unwelcome in the family). We are from different ethnical backgrounds, but I never thought this was an issue because I see tons of people being together happily from different cultures and backgrounds. I was devastated when he did that. I went through hell. Never thought this day would come especially when I gave him significant financial help, and the fact we had been together like 4ever. Then fast forward I dated a few men, found a new job, moved to a new place. At first everything is still a novelty, so I was motivated and excited. I dated a few men again. I was absolutely in love with the last one I dated, but he broke off abruptly. I have a problem that I must like the man when I first see him, I can't do \"try a few times and might fall in love\" scheme. This made me fall back into this dark place again. Tons of self-doubt. I am relatively good looking, fit and financially independent. But I just found so hard to find someone whom I love and loves me back and is willing to build a future together.  Apart from all that, I have a bunch of other issues, such as being an only child, so my parents depends on me (mentally and physically once that day comes); lack of other family members' support; always want to start a side hustle but always scared to lose or unable to handle; unable to focus, waste so much time ruminating over the past events, unable to enjoy any sort of events; unable to sleep consistently. All these thoughts are killing me. I just want to stop thinking all these bs and focus on making improvement and eventually achieve financial freedom, which might alleviate my anxiety somewhat. Anyone had similar situations or experience can share some tips, and how to handle day to day life? Much appreciated. ",

      "selftext": "Hello everyone, I'm 21 and I've been in a constant anxious state and panic for years now. I've been to therapy for a few months last year because my anxiety was so bad that I stopped going out and going to my university classes. \n\nSome symptoms I've had and still have: (must mention I did brain scans, blood tests,  other tests along my life and recently and all came back normal so nothing is wrong with me health wise and I dont have any brain tumors or anything)\n\n - Very proeminent now , i have a constant shakyness in my whole body , mostly hands and legs. I feel like I'm always shaking and scared because of it. \n- I also have depersonalization and derealization I often feel like I'm not real when i go out, i feel like someone else is doing my things (walking/moving / going to school) I feel like I'm not in a real enviroment or I'm just not real.\n- Recently my anxiety spiked up because i started feeling dizzy suddenly for no reason (did tests , ear tests , ct scans and nothing came wrong) and i felt like my head will fall(?) Not sure how to name it, feels like ill fall and die, feels like i can't keep my head up,  i feel my pulse in my head and it feels like my head is moving. Also because i often feel my pulse it feels alarming. \n\n(Another must mention, i study psychology , i also studied it my whole life and went to therapy and understand perfectly that it's just symtoms and i won't actually die and so on, but it doesnt seem to help even if i can say im already experienced by now , it still feels hellish, when i went to my psychologist i already knew what i had and what to do and she suggested pills and going to a psychiatrist which i don't know if i should take or not) \n\nOther symtoms are the usual i feel super scared , heart beating super fast, palpitations always,  not being able to sleep, i always have nightmares (demons chasing me most of the time or other stuff) i always feel scared in my dreams, i cant stay asleep i always wake up straight at 7 AM without my alarm , i never needed an alarm to begin with because im always awake at 7 no matter what, i hate the night because i know i wont be able to sleep , i have insomnia often , i feel tired but still a lot of energy , i feel like i have no joy in life anymore . I feel like my head is stuffed or full or pressured many times , my body aches a lot (must also be because i dont move as much now). I used to love going out and exploring , i had many hobbies and i really miss the old me. (Also must mention my mom is very strict , she wasnt very happy with me going to therapy to begin with and always complained , she also makes me very anxious because she was pretty abusive in the past but after i got a boyfriend she calmed down a bit). I also have many other symtoms that i can't recall now but I used to have panic attacks at night a lot in the past too. \n\nNow my question is , should i go and try therapy again or should I go straight to a psychiatrist and get pills? I tried therapy and it helped a bit but it backfired and its way worse now. I feel like I can't live my life anymore without stress and worry. I'm asking because I dont have the financial power to go to so much therapy again and pills sound perfect now to help me calm down.",

      "selftext": "As titled says. I don't remember how it started, but now every time I'm anxious I either get a stomach ache or some sort of feeling unwell, nausea etc. Most of the times it happens when I'm travelling somewhere, going to the restaurant or stuffy places where I can't just leave if I want to (my triggers ig lol).  I start to feel nauseous, start to worry that I will feel unwell, become anxious, start to feel unwell, I curl my toes for some reason and just hope for me to feel better soon. Deep breathing doesn't help since I start to focus on my symptoms even more and feel more nauseous, same with naming things I see etc.\n\nIt affects my life and makes me feel so sad. Currently I am in my bf's city and I really want to explore but I feel this annoying stomach ache and am scared to leave his place. Left yesterday and came back cus I got anxious and had stomach ache lol, as soon as he came back from work and things got spice all the anxiety and stomachache gone. Most of the times I'm scared to feel unwell (throw up, diarrhea, pass out etc) and thoughts of these symptoms happening make me even more anxious, however all of these maximum happened 5 times out of all other times that I went out and felt totally fine. But these 5 or so experiences altered my brain and cause my anxiousness of feeling unwell to be like 'that happened before, why wouldn't It happen now?'\n\n  \nOne of the stories, me and my bf (idk why but majority of these stories happened with him lol) went to a Georgian restaurant, had a nice khachapuri, although it was really stuffy and crowded which already made me alerted, after a while I started to feel unwell, used bathroom and then started to feel even worse. My anxiety worsened, symptoms went much much worse that I couldn't hold it in, we sat down on a bench for a bit till I feel better. When I did, we went to take subway to go back to hotel, 3 stations in and I feel a new wave of diarrhea. We had to get out and run find me a bathroom, the feeling , the anxiousness, the situation were horrific and left a big impact on my brain tbh. Humiliation, inability to do smth, not feeling safe all that together resulted in one of the worst days in my life. After that mentally I am scared to go to restaurants especially with my bf, although he is super understanding, caring etc. But just triggers me ig, another situation was we went to the restaurant, had a nice meal, I was anxious throughout whole visit, again had to use the bathroom and then when we finished our dining while walking I had throw up reflexes out of nowhere that also triggers me now. My brain works like: everything was okay, I felt like throwing up, why?, so it can happen again out of nowhere too? \n\n  \nI must say it doesn't happen every single time I go out, but it's definitely worse in my bf's town and unfortunately it happened to be one of the most touristy cities lol. I don't want to be this way and I don't want to miss out on memories with my boyfriend simply because I'm scared. I went to the doctor back home, nothing really wrong with my stomach but it's sensitive and I recently found out that I'm lactose intolerant (milk and cream for now). I haven't been to therapy or anything mental health related. \n\nI would love to hear from the people who had similar experiences, what has helped you? how are you doing now? Thank you.",

I‚Äôm starting to believe it‚Äôs just how my brain is wired, I‚Äôve tried talking to random strangers I almost always come off as awkward, I‚Äôm awkward with my own family. The only real but temporary solution in dealing with my anxiety has been weed and alcohol. Weed somehow makes me more extroverted although I‚Äôve heard that in majority of cases it has the opposite effect on people. When I am under the influence I am very social and feel confident enough got talk to pretty much anyone, it shows myself how hard I try and want to be social when I‚Äôm sober but ultimately can‚Äôt express myself because I constantly overthink what if this happens. Another solution for me has been supplements, I‚Äôve been using ashwagandha, nac, l-theanine and rhodiola daily to numb the feelings of anxiety at the cost of making life extremely more dull. I don‚Äôt enjoy doing certain activities as much and just feel empty, in fact the only thing I enjoy doing while on supplements is socialising because it‚Äôs satisfying to be able to socialise without racing negative thoughts and doing things I wouldn‚Äôt be able to do if I was otherwise off supplements. Only problem is when I stop taking the supplements my fear and anxiety goes back to normal. I‚Äôve been using supplements for maybe 2 years now and I finally feel like I found the perfect stack for me. I was under the impression that maybe just maybe I had lessened my level of fear and anxiety even when I am completely sober and not on supplements but recently realised that it‚Äôs not the case. My anxiety is just as bad as it‚Äôs always been, this was a completely shocking revelation for me as I‚Äôve tried so hard to overcome it putting myself in situations where I‚Äôm uncomfortable, speaking my mind and being more transparent with people but overtime it has literally made no difference. I‚Äôm at the point where I am genuinely starting to hate myself, it‚Äôs really hard to accept that I‚Äôm like this, not being able to live up to my own standards. I‚Äôm considering doing psychedelics now to completely rewire my brain and conquer my anxiety because I don‚Äôt want to live like this any longer. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever be able to make genuine friends or even get a girlfriend due to lack of confidence, this seems like it might be the only solution.",

      "selftext": "I am 28 years old and graduated with a degree in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE). A few months after my father's death, I started experiencing depression and anxiety, which gradually escalated into a severe anxiety disorder. The fear of death began to consume me. Apart from my father's passing, the negative behavior of some people also contributed to my condition. About seven months later, I got a job as a software engineer, but within a few days, my condition worsened again. I started having frequent panic attacks. I then worked at two other companies as a software engineer, but I realized that sitting in front of a computer from 9 to 6 made my condition even worse, so I couldn‚Äôt continue those jobs. I have only one friend, and he is always busy.\n\nFor my condition, I sought treatment at LifeSpring, but it didn‚Äôt help much. I also underwent psychotherapy at Dhaka University‚Äôs Nasirullah Institute alongside LifeSpring, but it didn‚Äôt provide long-term relief. Lately, I‚Äôve been having breathing issues, and sudden intense fears of death. During my university days, I was passionate about research in geometric deep learning and even published a few research papers. However, my plans to go abroad have been delayed.\n\nWhen I think about applying abroad, several concerns overwhelm me:\n\n1. Life is short. What‚Äôs the point if I end up dying alone there? There‚Äôs a lot of struggle abroad too.\n2. Who will take care of my mother? My brother is studying outside the city and is inattentive to such matters.\n\nI visit the lab once a week. When I work or take on stress, my blood pressure spikes. I don‚Äôt feel like doing anything. As the eldest son in the family, I feel the weight of responsibility. I think depression is also at play. I constantly feel like I could die at any moment. My physical and mental health isn‚Äôt improving. I have an interview coming up in a week, but preparing for it makes my health worse. I saw on Glassdoor that the job involves overtime work. I don‚Äôt know what to do. It feels like my life is falling apart. I am taking diazepam, risperidone, and sertraline, but sometimes I skip them because I‚Äôm trying to reduce my dependency. Is there a way out?",

I always needed some fresh air even though I knew it wouldn't have helped. I was disconnected from my own body and it wouldn't go away. I thought I was going crazy and it was the end of my life. I was trying to do anything to keep myself busy - watching funny videos, talking to my friends, walking. Even small distractions could make my day somewhat better.\n\nNow I'm wondering about prisoners - especially those who had mental health struggles even before being imprisoned. Imagine wanting to run, wanting comfort, but having nowhere to go, almost no privacy, and limited access to anything that might help.\n\nI've read some research talks about mental health in prison, but I couldn't find any personal stories. I want to know:\n\nDid these struggles get worse once you were inside?\n\nWhat small things helped you survive to get through the day?\n\nSince I've experienced similar feelings outside, now I cannot thinking about those who are literally trapped while feeling this way. I want to hear every story I can get. Thanks in advance.",

I'm starting to feel a bit more normal.\nWithout these tablets...I can't pee and it's very painful.\n\nThey also make my skin itch and painful pin pricks all over my body. ... Which doesn't help my anxiety either. \n\nI'm currently unable to work. I'm wondering about trying pregabalin again. But I did have mental health issues with this year's ago. \nI've noticed CBD oil has really helped me feel calmer in the morning. It's not perfect... But does seem to help. \nI'm also approaching a medical cannabis clinic to see if high strains of CBD might help me. \nI'm terrified of THC as I know that can affect my mental health and cause me to be lazy and eat far too much. \n\nI'm trying meditation.\nI'm exercising where I can. \nTrying breathing exercises. \nAnd when things are really, really bad (like I can't cope or feel suicidal) I just lie down or sleep. That's the last resort for me. \n\nIt's fair to say I have lots of stress, health issues and responsibilities in my life. \n\nI just wish I could deal with the sudden rush of crazy anxiety in the morning.

Prior to my anxiety disorder, I was a degenerate and smoked weed every day. I really miss it constantly and I have wanderlust thoughts that it would help. \n\nTo explain my sensitivity, I cannot drink, I cannot smoke weed, I have some instances with caffeine that I can tolerate it but its a day by day basis. When I hear people who say they have anxiety and talk about methods they use for calming down im always skeptical because I perceive myself more sensitive. \n\nMy question is for those who are in similar situations, have you successfully used high cbd/thc products with success. I understand the concept of it requires the right mental space to use it for fun but I am really hoping to use it as a tool for calming my physical symptoms. \n\n",

I‚Äôve done weed a lot before and it used be my happy place. I craved to be high. But what happened last night, scared me to my core. It felt like I was stuck in a thought loop, unable to come back to the reality in front of me. I was watching a standup on YouTube and I couldn‚Äôt even understand the jokes. \n\nThankfully, I was alone for most of the time but a friend came to talk at some point and I couldn‚Äôt even form more than basic sentences. I was completely in my head.\n\nI think all weed does is amplify your state of mind deep down and really brings it face to face with you. I‚Äôm a 25 year old guy working a well paying job. I have some close friends but I don‚Äôt ever talk about really deep stuff with them. I used to be satisfied in life before but now I just feel stuck. My romantic life, my professional life, my social life everything feels stuck and I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm doing enough about it. Due to this I think I feel myself less worthy and have a low self image.\n\nMy mind is in my control when I‚Äôm sober but it does drift sometimes. I guess what I‚Äôm looking for here is people who‚Äôve had similar experiences where they knew deep down something was wrong and they did something which helped them out get out of that state mind. I‚Äôm scared to do cannabis again because I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll be in my control.\n\nRight now, I‚Äôve promised myself to meditate, journal daily, be intentional and see a professional therapist in the near future. I really don‚Äôt want to get this at a point where this problem becomes a lost cause and I‚Äôll never be the old me again. So any advice is helpful. Thanks!\n",

Tomorrow, I am going on a 2 day mini vacation with just my mom to the beach! It's a 4 hour drive and I feel excited but, I also feel extremely anxious and I'm lying in bed right now thinking about getting a vertigo episode in public or at the beach (I know it can trigger it for some) and it's really stressing me out. I could just use some support or s pep talk to help me feel more excited and less anxious. Thank you guys! ",

It feels different from anxiety, because anxiety includes the restlessness, increase in heartrate, stomach cramps, spiraling, etc. So \"anxiety feeling\" isn't specific enough, as it could easily mean the panicked restlessness feeling.\n\nBut I don't know if there's a term for the specific horrible feeling that comes with the anxiety; the one feeling that I can feel isolated when I calm myself down completely yet still have the task open in front of me. I think it can most closely be compared to the \"flight\" part of \"fight or flight\".\n\nI might as well include the question I wanted to know about this feeling. Are there ways to deal with it?

No heart related issues in family.\n\nAbout a year ago, I had gotten into a difficult school. Work piled up, and I got stressed. So as a result of this, I had stayed up late doing homework and studying, and during the day I would have an energy drink(around 160mg). \n\nThis started out harmless, and I had one every week or so. It then eventually became more and more common, having one almost daily. \nSchool continued and I became very stressed all the time. \n\nI continued until about 5 months ago when I had experienced chest pain. I reduced my intake heavily, and played it safe for maybe a month until it started again. \n\nI had stopped energy drink consumption completely. Fast forward to now, my sleep is better and I manage my stress better, but my chest still aches. \n\nIt seems to get a bit better if I cut my caffeine completely, but if I stress too much or ingest in caffeine, it gets much worse for that day. \n\nA doctors appointment has been set, but I just want to know if anyone knows what might be wrong or what I could do in the meantime.\n\n",

      "selftext": "Yeah that's right. The people who are supposed to take care of you. Make you feel safe, loved. Sometimes parents can't even do the fucking bare minimum. Why get kids then???!!\n\nTW: Medical Terms(?), >!Vomiting, Loss of Appetite, Nausea, Fatigue!<\n\nAs I kid I never told them if I ever got sick. I never tell them how I feel. If I tell my dad about having a headache, vomiting, or having a stuffy nose, he would yell at me and call me an idiot and that I should've \"covered my nose before I went out in the snow because the cold makes you sick\" or some fucking bullshit.\n\nMy health anxiety rooted a while ago. There was a virus outbreak in my elementary school. It was one of the worst viruses I got. Literal loss of appetite, vomiting, nausea, and fatigue 24/7. Wouldn't my parents notice by now?\n\nThe first thing I thought of when I got this virus was HOW IN THE HELL WAS I SUPPOSED TO TELL MY PARENTS???? I said nothing until one morning at 7am I was lying on the couch feeling so goddamn dead both physically and mentally from this virus. My dad woke up and he saw me and didn't bother saying anything. After 2 hours of watching shows on the TV, he got pissed and yelled at me to leave, that there was nothing wrong with me and he does not want to take me to a doctor. My mom was also mad. She wanted me to eat something and forced me to eat some boiled eggs. I mustered up the courage to eat a few. I wasn't vomiting!! I kept eating more and more until I gagged. SPRINTED TO THE BATHROOM to throw up (and somehow I managed to throw up a boiled egg with nothing on it. Impressive I guess(?)) I heard my mom shittalking with my dad, how she's calling me a scaredy cat and a fucking pussy, not \"being strong\" and handling this sickness myself. I cried silently in the bathroom and then just proceeded to sit on the floor until I felt confident enough to come out of the bathroom (because my parents would give that disgusted stare if something stupidly dramatic happens).\n\nNow, it's been 10 years since that incident. Doctor google is my fucking go to and I convince myself 24/7 that I was, without a doubt, going to die from something horrible at a young age and no one will care. My mom always questions why I don't bring up any health issues (like how I found a lump and she immediately booked an appointment). \\*\\*\\*MAN I WONDER WHY.\\*\\*\\*\n\nMy mom is a lot better now, but I still keep a distance from her because of certain aspects (including health anxiety). My dad passed 9 years ago and I barely acknowledge the guy. It's crazy how the ones who are supposed to protect you actually create all of your anxiety and panic attacks. If I had normal fucking parents, this stupid health anxiety would not exist.\n\nI hope this post doesn't sound too selfish because I'm so tired from constantly searching up symptoms for a month and a half, and I need a place to vent üôÅ",

Over the past five years I have tried literally everything, been to multiple counselors, tried different medications (currently on antidepressants and a mood stabilizer) and I have been to a psych ward 3 times, one of those being for a suicide attempt. Also instead of going to a normal highschool I go to a program for neurodivergent and mentally ill teens, but it's not helping. I haven't done a full week of school since seventh grade and I often have panic attacks when I arrive at school, then I have to go home and even then they can continue for hours. When I do full days at school I end up exhausted afterwards and have no energy to do any of my hobbies. I know this is a lot. People keep saying that I just need to keep trying but as I already said I've been dealing with this for years whilst also dealing with my mom's divorce from my abusive dad and the trauma he gave me, being transgender, and the loss of my grandma due to terminal cancer.

Usually, I can just push through it and I'll start to feel better once the feelings go away (after some time). However, I was experiencing some anxiety (for about 2 days) and randomly woke up with intense chest pain. It felt like my chest would tighten and then release, and then it kept repeating. It scared me so bad that now I have even more anxiety from it, and my chest has felt tight all day with sporadic \"intense\" tightening moments. Should I go to the doctor or is this just part of anxiety? I talked to my parents and they said it was a common stress or anxiety symptom- but it feels so real, like maybe I need to go to the doctor? But at the same time, when my mind is distracted I feel it way less. Does anyone get this feeling or have any advice?",

      "title": "Stressed for work",
      "selftext": "This is a long one but if you like medical dramas you‚Äôll like this one. \n\nI am a neurosurgery RN with an extensive social anxiety and eating disorder Hx for the past >15 years since middle school in 2012 (and before). Now I work in neurosurgery as an RN. At first I was not anxious at all and feeling confident as an RN. Now after being on the unit for 10 months, each day I work it‚Äôs a gamble if I‚Äôm going to be sweared at, kicked, spit at, bit, hit, slapped, sexually abused, physically abused, or mentally manipulated, choked, yelled at, cursed at, cornered, questioned repeatedly, or even forced to eat stuff I don‚Äôt want on the unit either from staff or patients. \n\nIt‚Äôs taking a toll on me because I finally found a med regimen that worked for me but now, when I get report at the beginning of the shift (both night and day shift, doesn‚Äôt matter) 75% of the time I become violently nauseous, lose my hearing and eyesight, start sweating profusely, turn white as a ghost, and hear loud ringing in my ears, and need to excuse myself to throw up several times in the bathroom at every shift start. After I throw up 3-4 times I‚Äôm able to come back and resume my shift. \n\n\nIt is hospital policy that only 2 visitors at a time are allowed on the unit, but our charge nurses are always too busy to handle family conflict so allow 6-8 visitors per room when I already have severe social anxiety. And when family is in there I am constantly being bombarded with questioning, being told I‚Äôm the worse rn (because my patient may be restless and kicked off their shee recently), told im a sorry excuse for a nurse, and neglectful about the patients care when I am trying to do critical things like administer neurologically active medications when family is concerned about the patient having enough blankets. It‚Äôs so bad that my appt with my psychiatrist, he wants me to premeditate each RN shift with Xanax because my unit is so bad that I am throwing up every shift from anxiety. \n\nWe constantly have patients choking out nurses, spitting in their eyes, drawing blood from nurses. One patient recently required 18 staff and 6 police officers to restrain. Another patient chocked out a nurse last week and alsp attempted to lunge at the neighboring pt. He was mad that neighbor pt was able to sleep at 3am he wasn‚Äôt. \n\nI get the police called on me 2-3 times once  shift because (1) the other pt in the room is trachd on O2 and the oxygen is too loud, (2) they think they deserve a private room (we only have 2 private rooms that are reserved for severe infections), (3) pt thought I was withholding his meds when he was 3 hrs EARLY for Tylenol so I could not possibly administer it yet. So the police were called on me again that shift. \n\nI understand the patients acting out considering all of my patients have severe head trauma and/or hemi/total craniotomies with brain mass removal. But there is no excuse for the family members to show up and curse at me, throw things at me at 8:35AM.  \n\nAt every shift beginning I am used to passing out, shaking, throwing up 3 times, and having extensive diarrhea. After I regain my hearing and vision I am ok to continue my shift but it is really wearing me down. Keep in mind I have at the minimum 2 years and 2 months left on this unit because I had to joint a high-need unit after RN graduation in order for the school to cover 100% of my tuition. I LOVE neurosurgery and the intensity of monitoring. I LOVE learning about the brain and their conditions, effects, possible treatments, common meds and their mechanism of action/ side effects/ VS/labs to monitor. I love cardiac and neurological monitoring, always having to do those. I love being the one to notice a change in status, being able to report it immediately, being the first line for this patient on getting all assessments, scans, and labs done when something goes wrong. I love updating families on what we are doing and our plans for the day. I love being able to understand the exact mechanisms that are making my patients sick and the appropriate treatments that I need to expect. Q1HR assessments and being so proud when I notice the first stages of a stroke or ICH. I‚Äôm learning so much and have a great team in management. I‚Äôm so proud to be the first one to notice that neuro or cardiac change in my patients and to get them those STAT scans and labs, but family is never satisfied, they don‚Äôt know/care what I do for their family members when they are gone. I have never once missed a Q2 turn/reposition, never missed a cleanup even doing BM/urine cleanups Q1HR, give my patients full baths daily, all to just be yelled at that I‚Äôm not doing enough. I‚Äôm stressed. \n\nI am also working myself up each shift because in the past 2 months I‚Äôve passed out 3-4 times on the unit, so every time I show up for a shift I am now anxious about passing out which makes me feel faint. It‚Äôs so bad that when I throw up repeatedly during a shift, my coworkers all know it‚Äôs just the way I am and not an actual communicable illness like stomach flu. \n\nI have to be here for over 2 years at a minimum, besides pre medicating with Xanax, what the heck else can I do to prepare me for these shifts? I‚Äôm very stressed. I don‚Äôt go out because I don‚Äôt want to drink alcohol. I‚Äôm just lost and hurting the way these patients and family treat me/the entire unit staffing. Also I am only 25 and look much younger so I am always being yelled at for being inexperienced, when I actually have been rated the highest in my unit by my nursing manager for the amount of research I do, which no one else seems to care about. \n\nIn addition, I frequently have 3-5 HEAVY TOTAL patients and have frequently broken down in tears because when I need a 3-second boost or reposition, every other coworker seems to suddenly have something else then need to do so they dissipate to every other room. This only happens with a certain set of coworkers. And there I one coworker where the only 2 times I‚Äôve cried on shift, she has been ‚Äúassistive.‚Äù When I asked for help those days she told me, our nursing educator, ANM, and NM that she was not going to help me at all during that shift, she said it‚Äôs not her job as assistive to help me more than once a shift.\n\n\nI‚Äôm just having a hard time loving my job but also hating being physically/mentally abused every shift.  I really love the medical aspects of this unit but am not loving the abuse and it‚Äôs breaking me down. Besides premedicating shifts with Xanax I‚Äôm not sure how to deal with these negatives. I really do love the neurological and surgical part but not the family abuse. And like I said, I understand the pt possible abuse, but not from family/visitors.\n\nSorry if I misspelled/mispoke. I‚Äôm about to go to sleep before my shift tomorrow and I‚Äôm going to be up all night worrying about which type(s) of abuse I‚Äôm going to undergo tomorrow at work ",

      "selftext": "Hello. I think I'm actually going crazy every day that passes by so before actually worrying everyone in my house, I wanted to ask someone in here that knows about this or has experienced this, and then know if it's anxiety related or a real warning sign.\n\nLast tuesday I had an anxiety attack due to caffeine overconsumption. I've got a history of this (I somehow get really carried away when I drink caffeine) and they've always ended up in vasovagal syncope-like things. So naturally, I cut caffeine and decided to prepare some tea because it helps me calm down. While the water was boiling I decided to ease my mind off of what was happening and started braiding my hair to calm me down a little bit. Halfway through the first braid my entire left arm went numb (not the first time it has happened) and then my left leg, which made me worry and I don¬°t even know how, but somehow I figured out it was a heart attack (which doesn't make any sense, and I'm aware of that). That night, the symptoms ceased, my leg went back to normal but not my arm, and that's what I've been dealing with for now.\n\nI'm terrified of it being a heart attack, like really scared. I'm 17 though, young, and have no heart diseases. I actually almost fainted two years ago and they decided to do an echocardiogram, which showed no signs of anything otherwise being perfectly healthy. I'm \"fit\" (not overweight but not lean) I eat clean almost half of the time and I make sure to exercise every other day. I do have some family history of high cholesterol but last results came back almost incredibly good.\n\nThese are the \"symptoms\" I feel:\n\n- Left arm pressure, as if someone was taking my blood pressure, and sometimes numbness at the top of my hand.\n\n- Air hunger, like I can breathe but it feels like the air isn't enough.\n\n- Get fatigued if I walk fast or go up/down a flight of stairs (usual, but I don't know, I'm hyperfixated on this).\n\n- Really soft chest pains, like sudden stabs that don't really hurt but makes me notice them so obviously I get scared.\n\nAlso, where I live it's really cold and while I do sometimes get my fingers pale from it, today my left hand was more pale than my right one. I don't know if it was the lightning but that really freaked me off.\n\nI know the heart attack symtoms for women are different. I also came up to the conclusion it could also be a pinched nerve in the neck, since I tried to do some stretching exercises to adress it and my affected arm went numb, tingly, and then perfectly fine. I'm actually writing this down on here because I decided to do some pilates exercise to ease my mind off of this issue and now I feel pressure in my left arm, even though it probably is because I had to do some plank exercises.\n\nPlease let me know what it is. It's been a week now. Idk if I should tell my parents or just wait for it to go.",

      "title": "How can I get rid of fear of a rare disease?",
      "selftext": "about 4 months ago I went on a driving trip to California with a friend where we each spent about maybe 4-5 sometimes 6 hours driving constantly to get to our destination over a span of almost 2 weeks. \n\nBy the end of the trip I started experiencing nerve pain in both the bend of my elbows after having constantly driving with poor driving posture and keeping my arms bent towards me for hours even when I wasn‚Äôt the one driving and instead spending hours on my phone reading in the same position. that quickly went away within a few hours fast forward a couple weeks later and it comes back much more intensely to where I am on constant almost debilitating pain for the next few months(excluding the time where it once again went away for a whole week) \n\nI am doing a lot better now physically and am no longer in pain. I‚Äôve started my journey of seeing a neurologist to figure out where the problem came from as I‚Äôve pinched a nerve in my right arm before same place and everything but it went away within just two weeks. \n\nI‚Äôve done blood work, two MRIs, X-rays and now I am waiting for my final exam which will be an EMG to finally determine what‚Äôs going\n on  definitively as I am probable to have Carpal Tunnel and Ulnar nerve entrapment.\n\nSo why am I afraid of a very rare neurological disease? Good question. About two months in I saw a video of a certain Greys Anatomy actor talking about having developed a**. And for some reason my brain made me look it up and I wish I never had because some of my symptoms were lining up with this disease . \n\nAbsolutely terrifying to someone with health anxiety. I then proceeded to spend days reading reading and reading stories, medical journals, subreddits all dedicated to this disease to try and convince myself I didn‚Äôt have it. Which logically I understand I do not. \n\nBut the brain is very powerful and it just won‚Äôt let it go. \n\nMy current situation lines up perfectly with cervicogenic and nerve issues due to possibly my poor posture and some other things. \n\nAnd sure I may have very little commonality with this disease but everything else just doesn‚Äôt line up. I‚Äôve been in constant pain for months now having developed Occipital neuralgia along with the nerve pain. \n\nAnd because I am already a chronic anxiety stressor I‚Äôve developed symptoms like muscle twitches all over my body and face, bilateral arm weakness on and off , and some other very strange and difficult to describe symptoms. But mostly I‚Äôve just been in so much pain. But I am slowly getting better. \n\nBut I fear I may have traumatized myself by worrying about something I could not possibly have. \n\nI mentioned I do suffer from health anxiety but never ever like this before. Mostly it‚Äôs been small things that I wait out for a couple of weeks to see if they go away on their own which they have every time. And I‚Äôm not running to see a doctor over every little feeling as usually I put myself in the headspace of it is what it is. But this being the first ever multiple months long situation has made my mental health spiral into a dark place. \n\nI have never in my life been so scared of something. Not even scared of my heart condition I was born with which will always have risks of becoming serious again at any point in my life. So why am I so scared of this? Is it cause theirs no cure? Definitely. But logically it‚Äôs impossible for me to have it.\n\nLooking at the facts here:\n\nI am 20\n\nI am a female\n\nNo family history(although I know This  does not always matter as their are cases of sporadic a** in people with no previous familial history)\n\nIf I remember race plays another role in this as well and I am mixed but not white.\n\n\nAnd the disease is rare. Rarer in women and rarer especially in anyone below what 60-70?(sorry if that is wrong I am just trying to remember what I can off the top of my head)\n\nSo why am I so scared I just don‚Äôt understand. I do already see a psychiatrist and she knows I have health anxiety but we never really talk on it cause it‚Äôs never affected me like this before. And now I‚Äôm scared to mention it cause I don‚Äôt want her to think I‚Äôm crazy for thinking I have something that‚Äôs almost impossible for me to have. \n\nI feel really alone right now. I wish I had never heard of this. But luckily I am starting to have more good than bad days it‚Äôs just difficult to enjoy  them when you‚Äôre constantly experiencing new or returning symptoms everyday with pain on top of that.",

I've never been the most active, and I've been pretty heavyset most of my life‚Äî but between 2019 to 2024 I can say for certain it's probably when it was at its worst. Now I'm scared if it's too late for me to improve, or what I've been feeling is a symptom of improving.\n\nI started work around late August this year, and it's a mix of sitting and physical work caring 20-40 pund boxes. First month, the expected. Sore legs and feet when I got home. Nothing wrong there. Early September it subsided, but halfway through the month until I want to say around halfway through the 2nd to last week I had a weird period where for some reason my left foot most of the time felt tingly? Sore? And on some days would have pain go up to my knee through the front of my leg (think the shins) before dispersing completely or just staying a little bit longer in my left foot. That went away and now I have another worry that I'm not sure is from me recovering from one really bad day or what.\n\nSaturday Evening/Sunday Morning we had some really heavy rainfall that persisted all day. I was just dead tired. Like wouldn't wake up unless it was a bathroom break tired. I just slept in all day and didn't truly wake up until 9 PM. Now this morning I get a weird soreness in my legs that goes away thankfully, and for whatever reason both of my middle toes at different times have a slight tingling feeling that both last roughly 5 minutes? Also my right middle toe has a small brown sliver/dot riding the cuticle (not in the actual nail itself like with melanoma, but it looks like a small faded scab even though I don't think it is) Now I'm home, and my left leg is sore from where I sat on outside while waiting for my ride for work (which I'll admit is probably just on me for being stubborn for not going back inside).\n\n\nJust all of this has been freaking me out?? I'm so fucking afraid and all of this started over a warning about blood clots that showed up on my social media timeline and when to recognize them and despite me actively staying away from that shit knowing it would make me spiral‚Äî life is cruel and decides to show me posts everyone online related to blood clots on other places both serious and jokingly.\n\nI feel like I'm going crazy and I want to cry. I don't want to die. I don't want to ignore something that for once could be something serious. I'm scared. What do I do? I'm still able to move just fine and most days recently at worst I'm just a bit tired coming home. Weather here is still.shit so maybe that has a part in it?",

I am not sure if it's a good way or not, as I know the reason why social media brings me anxiety is not due to the platform itself, but rather the people that I have a relationship with. I've had problems (including my own problems) with my social circle, and now I get severely anxious and overwhelmed when I see any content related to them online. I've tried unfollowing, but since they are all related, I can still see people I've unfollowed. The problem is whether this is a good way to keep myself from feeling so anxious, or if I am just escaping instead of conquering or managing my own triggers. Furthermore, in the long term, I am worried that I will become more detached from the people around me.",

During this period I was getting medically discharged from the military because of this.\n\nA year later, the medicine actually almost killed me by lowering my blood pressure so low that I had a seizure AND Im pretty sure I went into cardiac arrest in front of my girl friend and her parents. It last about 30 minutes and I wasnt able to be verbally responsive to them until 45 minutes afterward.\n\nI immediately stopped taking the medication. I immediately stopped going to the doctor. \n\nA large portion of my income (what keeps me afloat) is my VA medical disability. I have a VA appointment coming up to get bloodwork and ask for a CPAP. Im terrified that Im going to go into the VA and they will lower my disability because I havent been going to the doctor, or taking medications. (Not sure if they can do that, but its something that keeps me anxious). Like that WOULD be my luck that I go in to get seen and they say ‚Äúoh well you seem fine now because you dont come to the doctor. Guess we‚Äôll take away your disability‚Äù and then I‚Äôll be fucking homeless.\n\nIt took me 2 years after I got out of the military to leave my house and be around people again. I cant work a normal job at the moment, but Ive been going to school (its only a few minutes away driving). \n\nGenerally when I look around myself, my life is okay. I have a nice house, my girlfriend and are deeply in love and get along pretty well, but I feel like such a fucking loser. I feel a shell of the man I used to be 3 years ago.\n\nI also starve myself because my anxiety is so bad, that I can only muster up enough appetite to eat once a day. At this point, I dont know what will kill me.\n\nWill my heart stop?\nWill my seizures?\nWill my anxiety?\nOr will I starve myself to malnutrition?\n\n\n\n",

Even though I knew my fear was getting in the way, because I truly am with an amazing guy, in my gut I didn‚Äôt want to do it at the moment and therefore knowing that I wouldn‚Äôt have any support from my parents if I didn‚Äôt go though with it in the end, and after three months of going meds, developing p√°nico attacks and losing a scary amount of weight I got married.\n\nHere is the thing. My anxiety surges from not wanting to be anyplace other than my home, safety place. I have worked really hard all my life to get out and have fun and experience life. My problem is that when you get married you don‚Äôt really have a choice when it comes to leaving your safety place. \n\nI HAVE TO MOVE OUT.\nI can‚Äôt keep living with my parents.\nBut I just wasn‚Äôt ready to be making those sacrifices, hence why I didn‚Äôt want to get married.\n\nI didn‚Äôt want to split holidays. Weekends. Trips between my in laws and parents. And I know that‚Äôs normal for married couples I just didn‚Äôt want to do it now.\n\nSo every time an even have to go eat lunch at my in laws I get crazy, crazy debilitating bawling my eyes out anxiety.\n\nAside from the fact that it has taken a huge toll on my marriage, my parents won‚Äôt recognize it a real problem. So there way of ‚Äúhelping‚Äù is by forcing my to be with my in laws and not invite me with them on trips or even to stay with them anymore.\n\nIt‚Äôs depressing to say the least and I am desperate.\n\nAdvice?? \n\n",

The problem is, their service number is so congested recently that I need to be very lucky to even get into the virtual waiting line. If I can talk to somebody, I think the chance of success is relatively high. The congestion could be a temporary thing, but I cannot be certain.\n\nI've had bad experience with this authority before, when they mishandled my case and were even rude to me, so somehow even calling them has become very stressful to me. Every press of the call button takes some courage in me, and usually it's met with a busy signal. Even the waiting music makes me cringe. Some people have been successful by calling over and over again until they got lucky, but even the thoughts of having to make the attempt keeps me awake at night. It's been only three weeks, but it's been detrimental to my well-being and ability to work. \n\nI don't even know why it's so stressful to me. It is really just pressing the call button. I've considered the worst-case scenario and it can still be dealt with. I need to find a balance between the attempts and my regular life. This battle could last for a while and I have to protect my well-being in the meantime.\n\nCurrently I allocate two 20-min time slots to call, in the hope that I can stop thinking about it after the attempts, but I still wake up multiple times at night, stressing over the next day. Any advice would be very much appreciated.",

When we hear loud traffic or someone shouting, it‚Äôs almost instant  our head starts to hurt, our body tenses up, and we just want silence. But when we listen to calm music, ocean waves, or even our favorite song, suddenly everything feels lighter. It‚Äôs strange how the same sense   hearing   can bring pain and peace depending on what we feed it.\n\nThat‚Äôs why I keep wondering about these ‚Äúsound frequency‚Äù apps that claim to reduce anxiety and help with depression. They say certain vibrations  432Hz, 528Hz, and others  can align your energy or calm your mind. I‚Äôve tried a few, and sometimes it does feel like something shifts inside, like my thoughts slow down or my breath gets softer. But I still don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs science or just belief.\n\nMaybe sound really is more powerful than we think. After all, everything around us vibrates   even our own heartbeat has a rhythm. Maybe healing starts when we learn to tune into it instead of fighting against it.\n\nWhat do you think   are these sound frequencies actually helping, or are they just a modern version of placebo with prettier packaging? Has anyone here tried them long-term and noticed real change?",

I really hope so, because it feels like what I‚Äôm experiencing is so specific that I‚Äôm the only person in the world living it.\n\nFor several weeks now, I‚Äôve been living through a mental and physical hell. It feels like I‚Äôm stuck in a constant ‚Äúsurvival mode‚Äù, as if my body has forgotten how to relax.\n\nI have strange sensations in my body, and I overthink everything: ‚Äúwhy am I me?‚Äù, ‚Äúwhy is my family my family?‚Äù, ‚Äúwhy am I the way I am?‚Äù.\n\nSometimes it feels like there‚Äôs a camera outside of me and I can see myself through it. I get dizzy, tense, my stomach is tight. I feel like no matter where I go, I can‚Äôt feel okay ‚Äî like nothing and no one can help me ‚Äî and that feeling stays all day, NON-STOP.\n\nAnd especially this horrible feeling of **derealization / depersonalization** ‚Äî those moments when I look at myself in the mirror or at my hands and my brain asks, ‚Äúis this really me?‚Äù.\n\nIt‚Äôs terrifying. I start doubting everything: ‚Äúwhat if I go crazy?‚Äù, ‚Äúwhat if this never goes away?‚Äù, ‚Äúwhat if this is the beginning of something serious?‚Äù.\n\nSometimes I even get scared that I might lose my mind completely, even though I know rationally that it‚Äôs just anxiety. But when you‚Äôre in the middle of it, logic doesn‚Äôt help. Everything feels too real.\n\nI have so many intrusive thoughts ‚Äî like I‚Äôll never get better, or I‚Äôll never feel like myself again.\n\nI used to think anxiety just meant ‚Äúbeing stressed‚Äù. But no. This is different. It‚Äôs like my brain and body are locked in a permanent state of fear for no concrete reason.\n\nI‚Äôm exhausted. I cry a lot, I‚Äôve lost my appetite, I can‚Äôt focus, and I spend all my time ‚Äúchecking‚Äù how I feel. It‚Äôs exhausting.\n\nI‚Äôve already gone through periods like this, but before, when I was in class or with friends, it would fade away. Now it follows me everywhere (and it‚Äôs even worse at school or on public transport). I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I‚Äôm tired, and the only thing that matters to me (it‚Äôs literally obsessive) is to get better. Because no matter what I do ‚Äî even when I‚Äôm having fun ‚Äî 60% of me is fighting anxiety and 40% is actually living the moment.\n\nAnd sometimes I have really dark thoughts ‚Äî I‚Äôm afraid of completely losing control, or of never escaping this state, or just ‚Äúsnapping‚Äù one day... even though I have absolutely no desire to hurt myself or anyone else. It‚Äôs just fear, fear of losing control.\n\nI just want to feel normal again, to have a normal life, with normal worries...\n\nIf anyone has experienced something similar or managed to overcome it, I‚Äôd be really grateful if you could share your story or some advice.\n\nThank you to anyone who took the time to read this üíõ",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone, I don‚Äôt really know where else to put this. Everything in my life feels like it‚Äôs falling apart right now.\n\nI‚Äôm 25, originally from Turkey but living in the UK. I‚Äôve been struggling with a very specific health anxiety for years: the fear of appendicitis. Between 21‚Äì24, it would flare up for a couple of weeks, ruin me, then disappear again. For the last two years I‚Äôd stabilised with ACT Therapy. Somehow finished a master‚Äôs degree, got a good job, moved from Sheffield to Manchester, started renting my own flat. But about a month ago it came back full force, and this time it hasn‚Äôt left.\n\nThree weeks ago I got a stomach flu. Since then I‚Äôve been in a¬†constant¬†state of anxiety, convinced I‚Äôm about to be hospitalised for appendicitis at ANY SECOND. No symptoms needed. It‚Äôs not like I worry about everything health-related; it‚Äôs just this one thing.\n\nWhen I was 14, a girl at school described her appendicitis in graphic detail during a time when I was being bullied really badly. I think that planted something in my brain.\n\nAnd when I was 10, I had a circumcision surgery that was genuinely traumatic. I was terrified of needles at the time. So they had to¬†force the IV on me¬†while I screamed and cried. I remember feeling trapped and completely helpless. I remember talking to my mom crying while they were giving me the anaesthesia etc. That‚Äôs the only surgery I‚Äôve ever had, and it left a huge mark.\n\nMy psychologist (who specialises in health anxiety and OCD) thinks this is all trauma-related and wants to start EMDR. When I talked about that surgery in detail for the first time as no other therapist thought to ask me about it, it was like the floodgates opened. Flashbacks, panic, intrusive memories. My anxiety skyrocketed.\n\nBut I don‚Äôt feel safe enough here in the UK to start EMDR. I live alone, and lately I‚Äôve been sleeping at other people‚Äôs houses because I just can‚Äôt handle being by myself. My body feels like it‚Äôs permanently in danger mode.\n\nTo make things worse, I had to give my cat to a foster home today because I can‚Äôt take care of her right now, and I might have to quit my job because I‚Äôve only been there 5 months and they can‚Äôt give me 6‚Äì8 weeks off for mental health reasons. I feel like I‚Äôm losing everything. My cat, my job, my sense of stability.\n\nThe only thing that makes me feel safe is the idea of going back home to Turkey for a couple of months. I really REALLY want to get better. My parents are both doctors, and when I‚Äôm with them, I finally feel calm. But that‚Äôs also part of the problem: it‚Äôs a¬†safety behaviour. Every time I used to go home when it was bad, I stabilise for a bit, but then I would have to come back here and face it all over again.\n\nI don‚Äôt know what to do. Should I go home to stabilise and do EMDR there? Or will that just make it harder to come back to the UK later? My psychiatrist suggested starting Effexor to help with baseline anxiety, but even the idea of starting new meds feels overwhelming right now when I feel unsafe anyway.\n\nTyping all this out makes me anxious. Plus, I have such a warped image of appendicitis in my head, like I‚Äôd be in excruciating pain for hours, waiting endlessly in A&E before surgery. I don‚Äôt even know what‚Äôs real anymore.\n\nIf anyone‚Äôs gone through something similar (trauma connected to medical experiences, health anxiety that feels out of control, or doing EMDR when you don‚Äôt feel safe) I‚Äôd love to hear how you managed it.\n\nI feel like flying back home, stabilising and doing EMDR work feels like the right thing to do, but I really don't know. I've never wanted to get better this badly. I loved my life here until a month ago.",

I have some days where its manageable but most of the time I just feel so out of it, as if I'm watching myself go about my day, even when I'm with family or my gf but I try to act normal for them. I've been trying to cope by keeping busy but its so crippling sometimes that I find myself going on drives at 2-3am cuz i feel like im mentally suffocating and losing my mind. I know im stressed out from a variety of reasons work/school/career path and quitting nicotine 7 months ago but I've never experienced anything like this for such an extended period of time and I thought it would go away sooner than later but it really hasnt. I turned 26 today and realized this has been the hardest year of my life so far mentally, my only fear is that nothing gets better and I have to learn to live everyday like this until I cant. I finally worked up the courage to share this here after waking up today at 5am with deep anxiety and feeling like I wasn't real. This is my first time ever posting on here as I just needed anyone to share this with after keeping it bottled up for so long, so I'm grateful for whoever replies back. I hope we can start a thread where everyone feels like they can share their current or past experiences. Thank you all, I hope you guys are doing okay.",

      "title": "How can i get over my car anxiety after my accidents? TW: Accident description, minorish injuries, anxiety/trauma afterwards",
      "selftext": "Hello everyone.  I‚Äôll first explain the accidents and what came afterwards.\n\nTowards the end of October last year, someone did an illegal u-turn right in-front of me and I couldn‚Äôt avoid it. I pushed on the break as hard as I could, but there was no saving it. I hit his passenger side door, so all the impact was on me directly. It was a ‚Äúminor‚Äù accident, but left me with long lasting effects.\n\nHe admitted to speeding and being in a rush, yet he wasn‚Äôt penalized not one bit. He was an elder man, and appeared intoxicated. This was my first car accident where I was the driver. He started saying, oh the damage isn‚Äôt bad let‚Äôs just go home. Thankfully, a cop pulled up right away. I hate this cop. He saw that I was going through an anxiety attack and just kept asking over and over ‚Äúinsurance‚Äù or ‚Äúpolice report.‚Äù In my deluded anxiety state, I‚Äôm thinking oh if I do the police report i can‚Äôt do the insurance. I even asked him that. He just kept asking me over and over, and out of fear not being able to get help from my insurance, i told him insurance. Well that screwed me later. The case took until JUNE to close.\n\nI had an anxiety attack right afterwards, and didn‚Äôt feel pain yet. After 30 minutes, when I started driving home, the pain set in. My lower back was burning and hurt so bad. I got home and tried to sleep it off, but to no avail. That night I believe I couldn‚Äôt sleep until 4 am from the pain. When I woke up, both of my legs hurt extremely bad. It wasn‚Äôt like bone pain, it was more nerve and muscle pain. I could barely walk. That night I went to the ER, and I kept telling them it‚Äôs not bone pain it‚Äôs nerve pain, yet they would only examine me by X-ray and nothing more. They sent me home afterwards because obviously nothing showed on the x-ray. I had this leg pain for an entire month afterwards. Anytime I slept on my back it felt broken.\n\nI couldn‚Äôt get into psychical therapy until january, but even then it only helped while I was actively there. Whenever I‚Äôd leave, the pain would just come right back. My neuro diagnosed me with Lumbosacral radiculopathy, due to the pain radiating from my sciatic nerve. The leg pain eventually left in my left leg, but never my right. Because‚Ä¶.. Dun dun dahhh I got in another car accident in February right when I finished the required psychical therapy ‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®\n\nThis one is what really messed me up. I always had car anxiety regardless. The first car accident had me anxious as hell driving past u-turns or any turns period. The second one scared me off the road.\n\nI was slowing down for the draw bridge, and the woman behind me didn‚Äôt notice. So, she flew into me at about 50-60 mph‚ú®. My trunk got crushed, not all the way, and the side of the car started hanging down.\n\nOnce again, had an anxiety attack right afterwards. This one was even worse than the other one. I couldn‚Äôt breathe at all. The lady was pretty nice and helped me through my anxiety attack. Once again, no pain afterwards. This accident totaled my car, so they automatically wrote up the police report.\n\nWe were there for about an hour, and then we split ways. This time, I didn‚Äôt feel anything until the next day‚ú®. The next day, my upper back, my neck, and shoulders HURT. The leg issue got worse after this one. I can barely walk now without my upper back and my right leg hurting. Also anytime I get stressed or tense up, my entire upper back locks up.\n\nSo now I have , upper and lower back pain alongside leg pain‚ú®. This time I went into psychical therapy about a week after. Same thing, only helped at the current time, and pain came back right after.\n\nThis accident truly screwed with me. The first accident is way more avoidable than the second one. So now, I was scared of being on the road period. Someone can hit me from anywhere. The anxiety was so bad, I became the bad driver. Any little instance, I‚Äôd think that someone was about to hit me. Every red light, I looked at the back with fear. Every turn. Even driving. I was terrified whenever someone would drive behind me.\n\nI turned in my car to the insurance around the end of May, and haven‚Äôt driven since. I did drive once but it was because I went with my cousin to a place over the highway. She drives like a total psychopath. Once we got on the highway, she told me that she doesn‚Äôt have her license and doesn‚Äôt know how to drive on the highway. I was scared shitless. I literally guided her the whole way. SHE WAS ON HER PHONE THE ENTIRE TIME ON AND OFF THE HIGHWAY BY THE WAY. When it was time to leave, I told her hell no I‚Äôll drive home. The drive back involves a longggggg and sharp circle thing on the highway. I was like yeah buddy we won‚Äôt make it if you drive. So here I am, car anxiety and all driving a car I never drove before. I had the worst anxiety ever. My leg was shaking so bad but I kept it steady on the pedals. Her baby sister. was nagging me the whole time and made everything 10x worse. Now that was my last time driving.\n\nEver since, when I want to test drive a car, I‚Äôve been scared to. I am terrified of driving still even though it‚Äôs been months. Hell it‚Äôs even been a year almost. Every time I get in the car with someone, I‚Äôm scared. They always drive reckless, and I‚Äôm just there tensing up and gripping on the car for my life.\n\nI‚Äôm checking a car out today, and it‚Äôs looking really good so far. But i‚Äôm scared. How do I get over this car anxiety. My PCP said I should go into therapy, but how would therapy help with car anxiety? I was thinking maybe driving school would be better? I don‚Äôt know. I have no idea what to do.\n\nPlease let me know how I can get over this. What should i do???\n\nP.s. I fell on my lower back on the stairs when I was 18 (I‚Äôm now almost 23), and have had lower back pain since then. The accident just worsened the pain tenfolds.",

      "selftext": "Three years ago, during an exam at university, I felt as if my arm and leg were tightening, like someone was pressing on them. I don‚Äôt know if it was just my feeling or reality, but it lasted for a while. When I mentioned it to the doctor, he said it was probably nothing. My right arm continued to feel tight for some time and had strange tingling sensations that I kept noticing. After a while, it calmed down a bit, but after a stressful family event in the winter, my muscles started twitching all over my body, and that lasted for about 2‚Äì3 months. As soon as winter passed, my body went back to normal and stayed that way for about seven months. Now again, after having a cold and fever for a few days, I‚Äôve started feeling strange sensations on my right side and slight muscle twitching. I‚Äôm wondering why this is happening, if anyone has experienced the same thing, and if it‚Äôs possible that all of this is triggered by my excessive worry about my health and my fears.",

Now, the new neighbors I have constantly bang, make loud noises anytime I am in the kitchen, living room or simply just talking on the phone. I am not loud, I try to be respectful to my neighbors by not making noises past 10 at night and I am not even that loud of a talker. Their constant banging every time that I do something is really getting to me and it‚Äôs making my anxiety worse that what it is. Any advice on how I should move forward?",

Had another one last night and every single time I get rushed to the Hospital due to my history of heart problems. I hyperventilate too much to the point where my phosphate levels drop severely and then I have to receive phosphate intravenously. I get very confused, dizzy, short of breath, dry mouth, uncontrollable shaking, weakness in legs and arms, numbness, burning and heart palpitations. \n\nI have contacted my doctor to discuss some options as I honestly do not want to continue living like this. I am in constant fear everyday and can not carry out/do normal day to day activities in fear that the attacks will start again. So I guess my question is what are somethings you guys do to help with a panic attack instantly? I would also love to hear your symptoms so I know I am not the only one. Thanks in advance! ",

Take each day as it comes. Try to eat well etc. I have began to meditate, exercise and also see a psychiatrist and psychologist once every two weeks. \n\nMy medication includes Oxazepam and sertraline. I have recently switched to sertraline as the previous antidepressant had no affect. \n\nThe only things that are helping are the exercise, walking, oxazepam, cooking and talking. I‚Äôve also stopped drinking coffee. \n\nStill after around 3/4 weeks I am still waking up with this absurd chest tightness to the extent I am taking deep breaths to try and relieve it. \n\nI wanted to hear from the community if some of you have had a similar experience and if you‚Äôve found other ways to try and overcome this. As my mood improves and I am more and more energized, more like myself, this chest stuff continues. \n\nI‚Äôve also had all the medical tests to rule out anything physical which came back clean. \n\nGrateful for your responses, stories and words of support!

Glass/stainless food containers, stainless steel pots, basically everything that comes into contact with food is either glass or stainless steel.\n\nAnd generally, I'm really into organizing my home: plastic containers to store different things, plastic dividers in my drawers, plastic boxes for tissues & cleaning solutions, rotating trays for all my jars etc.\n\nSuddenly a fear came on to me, what if plastic doesn't really need to come in contact with food to become toxic? And I look it up, and sure enough plastics continuously release hormone disrupting chemicals, VOCs, and microplastics into air and dust. Heat accentuates it, but they can release harmful substances over time even without heat.\n\nIt took me a \\*really\\* long time to stop feeling anxious over home organization. I finally got the hang of it and everything is now stored away neatly. Now I'm panicking, did I create a harmful environment? Do I have to throw everything away and restart? I'm so sad, please tell me it isn't that serious",

This also can be expensive if you're in the USA.\n\nI had to go to the ER tonight due to an absolutly horrid panic attack. My panic attacks often lead to me being scared I'm dying, that there's something wrong with my heart, or I'll stop breathing. This time was no different. Fortunately my panic attack got resolved.\n\nAnd they did tests just to make sure there was nothing wrong with my heart and lungs. \n\nAnd they came back all good! And they even wrote down how good the tests went so I can look at it when I'm panicking to remind myself I'll be okay. It's a lot easier to tell my brain \"you aren't dying, these are just sensations\" when you have proof. Not a fix-all or anything to panic attacks, but definitely helpful.\n\nThis is soley my experience, definitely not for everybody, but I wanted to share in case it could help someone.",

      "selftext": "\n\nI'm lost as a person, I don't know who I even really am.\n\nI'm 29 year old guy. I'm diagnosed with severe depression, anxiety, and bipolar. It's something I struggle with every day. I've tried to take my own life previously, suffered from self harm. I can sit here and list every negative trait I can see like I'm looking into a mirror.\n\nI don't know what I'm doing with my life. I just got my license for the first time in my life in July. It was freeing to finally have mobility. I've been going out to card shops and playing magic with people and being social, and it's helped me feel alive socially. It's the one good thing I feel like I have going for me.\n\nI still struggle socially. I haven't had a girlfriend since 2018. I've only dated twice, both lasting about 6 months. My first girlfriend cheated on me and left me for someone who dumped her within a month. My second girlfriend dumped me, and then started false accusations against me. Saying I assaulted her, and stalked her. She got engaged and married 5 months after dumping me, she and her husband followed me and tried to get me fired from my job or get me banned from various places she knew I frequented. I haven't dated since, and any attempt I have made has ended poorly. I took about 4-5 years to figure myself out socially and try to better myself so I could be a better partner than I was, because honestly I wasn't the best but I didn't deserve what had happened. Now it's a mix of being told how my attempt to ask someone out for coffee or just to get to know them was cute or endearing or just being ghosted once they feel my awkwardness. I'm not everyone's cup of tea, but it feels like slamming my head into a wall trying to not imagine myself dying alone. I struggle with incel thoughts, I refuse to stoop that low. It's frustrating knowing people who literally don't bathe and somehow having a partner constantly.\n\nCareer wise? I have no clue. Growing up I wanted to get into game development, then it transformed into voice acting. College was a fluke and I dropped out my junior year due to FASFA fucking me over. I worked food service for 4 years, I got a job doing cold call sales and made it 9 months before they were going to fire me. I tend to lose myself in work and just abuse myself by working long hours to forget it all. My most recent job was 2 1/2 years working as a business development rep for a shitty company who paid me $17. The best thing I did at that job was get the company in legal trouble as I caught them committing wage theft.\n\nI quit that job in July, I moved at the end of August to my Dad's house about an hour away. I'm broke and feel like an absolute burden on my father who wants to retire. I just got accepted into a local community college for electrical engineering. I don't have any passion for it, I just want a job to work and stop being dead broke.\n\nI'm lost for what to do with any of it. I was once told by someone that I was put on this planet to create something, and I know that's true. I feel like I have things that I want to open up to the world and say for others to see and relate to. I adore the band NIN and see how it's writing from a fragile, intimate place and I feel like it's a calling of mine to do the same, not necessarily with music but something. But I have no outlet, I have no drive to do any of it. I have so many thoughts trapped in here with myself and it's eating away at me.\n\nThere's only been one thing in my life I woke up with a smile doing, and it feels pathetic. It was competitive magic the gathering. I traveled 2 times within the state for large multi-thousand people tournaments. My very first one I went 6-4 on day one, a single win away from making day 2 and winning money. I've won small events at local shops and it's such a rush understanding how deep and complex this nerdy game is. That was in 2018, I stopped playing shortly after that but only recently picked the game back up and my god do I want to do it again. I want to get into Legacy and Vintage, but I have no money for it. It's sad to say, but it's what is making me want to get a career, I want to buy hundreds of dollars of cardboard, fly out to a different state and sit down and play competitively. It's such a rush and a positive feeling for me. Shout out to Brian Coval, I've lived vicariously through his videos of watching high level play with sheer awe.\n\nI've sat here writing this during a 3am manic episode, I'm safe and have no thoughts of doing anything stupid. I just don't know what I want to do anymore. Thank you for listening to my scream into the void.",

      "selftext": "So, I was traveling on a train today, and I swear I almost caused a minor disaster, and I'm still not sure if I‚Äôm the jerk here or not.\n\nI was on my way to a destination, and I had one of those window seats that face towards the aisle. I had been fiddling with the chair trying to adjust it and found a little lever on the side of the chair. Naturally, I thought it was the lever to tilt the chair back more, so I pulled it. But nothing happened. I pulled it again, harder, still nothing.\n\nThen, out of nowhere, I hear the unmistakable sound of the train‚Äôs brakes - that screeching, metal-on-metal sound - and the train starts slowing down. Naturally, everyone on the train is looking out the windows, trying to figure out what‚Äôs going on. A few people are even starting to murmur. At this point, my brain does what it always does: I jump to conclusions and start panicking.\n\nI instantly thought, \"Oh no, did I pull the emergency brake chain?\" I start sweating. The train is slowing, people are looking at each other, and I‚Äôm internally freaking out, thinking I‚Äôve done something to halt the entire train. I‚Äôm convinced I just caused a major disruption and potentially even an emergency stop. Everyone's looking around, and I‚Äôm trying to keep a straight face, but my mind is spiraling.\n\nBut then, the train picks up speed again, and everything seems to return to normal. My heart is still racing, and I‚Äôm trying to figure out what just happened. That‚Äôs when I finally realize - I was pulling the wrong lever.\n\nThe lever I had been pulling wasn‚Äôt for my seat at all. It was for the chair next to me! The actual lever to tilt my chair was on the left side of my seat, not the right. The one I was pulling on the right was just for the person sitting next to me. I felt like an absolute idiot.\n\nSo yeah, I spent the rest of the journey feeling like I had almost caused a train delay, all because I got confused by a chair lever. I didn‚Äôt tell anyone, but I couldn‚Äôt stop replaying the moment in my head, wondering if anyone suspected me of pulling the emergency chain.\n\nAITA for panicking and thinking I caused a train emergency when it was really just a simple lever mix-up?",

His seizures have been 3 months apart, but he just had one tonight (one month after his most recent one). I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve been ‚Äúcoping‚Äù with this (I still worry and fixate on his every movement daily), but the routine of one seizure every 3 months has helped me with my anxiety. Now that a random one was just thrown in, I‚Äôm at a complete loss.\n\nI can‚Äôt live like this for the foreseeable future! My thoughts are racing, I feel like throwing up, I have a pit in my stomach‚Ä¶ I cannot feel this way every day or it will cause permanent damage to me. I know this is an extremely niche situation, but if you have anxiety/OCD and you also have a pet with similar health issues, how are you surviving?!\n\nThis journey with my dog is just beginning so I am new to navigating this anxiety.\n\nThank you for any and all support.

I had agoraphobia and had to be homeschooled at one point because my panic attacks were so bad everyday. I got into CBT therapy and was on Celexa for about a year or two. I was able to get better and went off to college. I didn't have anxiety for a long time.\n\nFast forward to 31. I had my first full blown panic attack a couple months ago due to some depersonalization I was experiencing late at night. From there, anxiety trickled back into my life. I finally got the courage to get back on Celexa and get therapy, but the medicine has had a lot more side effects. I've had loss of appetite and more generalized anxiety. This has snow balled into so much more health anxiety.\n\nLast night, I was trying to sleep and felt my chest tighten, my heart race, and my body get extremely warm. From there my palms and feet got a cold sweat and I began shaking. I had a full blown panic attack again. I was able to calm down and try to sleep, but this began a cycle. I spent the whole night getting anxious as I began to drift into sleep, get anxious, calm down, and get anxious again. I am so sleepy and the drowsiness is triggering me. I've tried to nap and the same cycle keeps happening. I'm scared I will lose my mind and faint or something like this.\n\nHas anyone ever felt this way and did anyone figure out how to get better?\nThank you for reading this all...l am desperate for answers and relief.",

In that year, I‚Äôve trialed numerous antidepressants and augmentations with only partial success. I am considering ketamine treatment as my last hope, but if that doesn‚Äôt work, then I‚Äôm seriously considering going on benzodiazepines long term. Weighing the risks of cognitive decline in later years vs my quality of life now, I‚Äôd rather take that risk. Because honestly, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll make it to the age where cognitive decline would be an issue if I can‚Äôt have my anxiety under control.\n\nI am currently prescribed Ativan as needed, 0.5mg, which is the only thing that even remotely alleviates my panic. I‚Äôve had two prescriptions of 30 pills, which have lasted me from January until now. So i know I‚Äôm not abusing it. \n\nMy questions for this group are\n\n1. If you‚Äôve had to resort to long term benzo use, at what point did you decide that? When did you know?\n\n2. Will my tolerance build up so much that even the max dose won‚Äôt be effective anymore? My goal is to get stable on the lowest possible dose.\n\n3. Have you had trouble getting your psychiatrist to prescribe these long term? I‚Äôve been working with my psych this entire time and he knows I‚Äôve tried everything under the sun. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôd be totally against the idea. Especially when knowing my quality of life now.\n\n4. Am I being totally stupid considering this option? Are the negative consequences of going on long term benzo use so bad that I‚Äôm going to regret this later down the line?\n\nThanks for advice\n\n\n",

      "title": "I don't know how to prioritize myself",
      "selftext": "I've realized in the past few months that I really struggle prioritizing myself when it comes to people I care about. When I was younger I was very independent and vocal about things I wanted. I wouldn't disregard or ignore what other people wanted, if they wanted something different I respected it and was okay with them doing whatever with the \"to each their own\" mindset, however the reactions I received were extremely negative. I was told every time that I was being selfish. I'm the youngest of three sisters, I am an identical twin, and I grew up as the \"odd one out\" frequently. I was always happy and content doing my own thing but my sisters always told me that I didn't want to hang out with them, that I didn't care about them, etc. when that was never the case, I just had my own interests and wanted independence.\n\nFor example, if my family and I went to go out and eat I would say what I wanted which was typically different than my sisters and my dad, but the same as my mom. She would suggest that we both go eat that and my sisters and my dad could eat what they wanted which I never saw as a problem, as we all got what we wanted. My sisters on the other hand saw it in a different light and said I only cared about myself, didn't want to spend time with them/our family, etc. when, at least the way I viewed it, I was being clear about my wants and preferences. This happened every time I ever wanted to do something that didn't align with their preferences. This then grew to be a problem with confrontations or issues where anytime we had an argument I was constantly made to believe it was my fault, even when I genuinely felt my feelings were valid, they were hardly, if at all, acknowledged.\n\nI didn't realize until my boyfriend brought it to my attention that I just go along with whatever everyone else wants and never vocalize my thoughts or preferences. Since I had been doing this for years, it became my normal that I forgot how I've always wanted to be independent and used to be assertive. And I've come to realize that I have never had healthy conflict resolutions as I was always the one to apologize and state I was in the wrong. I know how to see someone else's point of view and acknowledge how my actions affected them, but I haven't ever had the same understanding in return. Due to this, any issue I have with someone I don't know how to approach it and whether I'm processing it correctly. When any sort of conflict occurs I panic and don't know how to approach it since I am already anticipating a negative reaction because that's pretty much all I know. I constantly apologize for anything that I think can cause an issue to try and prevent the conflict. Or if I think I have upset someone I feel that I'm at fault and apologize. \n\nNow that I'm older I've come to realize just how frequently I dismiss my feelings as irrational and ignore them in the process. I focus everything on putting myself in the other person's shoes and while doing that completely negate my own feelings by dismissing them as an overreaction. I know that this isn't healthy and my feelings are valid, I just never know when to distinguish when/if they are since I've never had them acknowledged. I don't want to keep doing this, but at the same time I don't know how to change it since I've been doing it for so long. Not only this, but I don't know how to bring up any issue or negative feelings (when I'm disappointed, sad, upset with someone, etc.). And when I do want to discuss them, I can't without having an internal panic that whoever I have an issue with is going to get upset with me for having a problem in the first place. \n\nI don't want to keep telling people that everything's fine when it's not since I know that ignoring problems will only lead them to build up if they go unresolved. But I'm genuinely terrified of bringing them up in the first place. I also would like to find a good balance of acknowledging someone else's feelings without ignoring my own. I really just don't know how to recognize when my feelings are ever justified given the situation. And when they are I have no clue how to go about resolving them. So any tips on how to distinguish between an overreaction vs rational, how approach conflict effectively, etc. would be extremely helpful! I'm so sorry for the long post, but if anyone has any advice on what I can do I would really appreciate it! Thank you in advance!",

It was sparked with me initially having anxiety that everyone else was going to die and fears of suffering as I get older. However, through therapy I have been doing well with curbing those thoughts. Yet, I now have anxiety over noting.

      "selftext": "Almost 5 weeks\n\n37F - 3 kids (13, 5 & 1)\nOver the last few months I‚Äôve developed quite bad health anxiety to the point where I‚Äôve been experiencing panic attacks. In the beginning I thought I was having heart attacks but my numbers would always come back normal after I‚Äôd been to the ED and my GP. I also had the extra testing done on my heart and all was fine! \n\nI believe my trigger was my 1yo daughter (at 6 months old) had a bad allergic reaction to peanuts that we had to get paramedics to attend and we ended up staying in the hospital the night for monitoring. \nSince that incident I‚Äôve had multiple bouts of gastrointestinal issues, back pain, arm pain, chest pain, heart palpitations as well as a parasite. \n\nAfter about my 7th or 8th visit to the GP and crying my eyes out he asked if maybe I have some anxiety or stress. I said I thought it was just life but i just can‚Äôt seem to get on top of it. He said anxiety can present itself in physical symptoms so he wasn‚Äôt discounting the fact I‚Äôve been experiencing these real symptoms. He suggested to try Fluoxetine 20mg for 3 months to see how that helps. And to check in with him regularly. he also prescribed me propranolol to take as required if my heart starts going too fast for comfort. \n\nI started the medication on the 10th Sept. The first 2 weeks I could barely go to work as I was experiencing so many side effects, nausea, tired, no appetite, body aches and pains and then towards the end of my first week I had the worst panic attack I‚Äôve ever experienced. I was feeding my daughter her nightly bottle and I had the hot flash of pain run up the back of my neck and I was hot all over and I started shaking uncontrollably. My husband called paramedics and they came to check me and again my numbers were all ok. \nAfter the 2nd week on medication I started to feel better, the side effects were nowhere near as bad as they had been and I felt like I could function. \nI had found the most delicious hot chocolate drink I was having in the evenings that contained magnesium glycinate and collegan. I drank that for 4 nights in a row and the next morning while driving to work I had another really intense panic attack, I was hot all over I had pains in my arms and chest and I felt like I was going to pass out. I rang my husband who talked to me and calmed me down. I went to work and worked the whole day like nothing had happened. \n\nToday is 4w5days and I woke up this morning with sweaty hands and feet (which has been a constant side effect since the start of the med) but then I found I had so much energy I made a big to do list of everything I wanted to get done today and then I had pains in my arms and chest tightness and my energy disappeared. \n\nI‚Äôm starting to feel like that magic switch is trying to click over but then I have moments that pull me back down to sitting on the couch being very unproductive. \nI‚Äôve read so many success stories on here and that has kept me going through this onboarding process. I hope to be one of those success stories soon enough. ",

The thought of not being able to exist forever. Because when I die, I‚Äôm gone. Forever. For Ever. I‚Äôll not even come back in a billion years. I‚Äôm really just gone. \n\nI‚Äôm 17 and I lived my whole life with my grandparents, and lately, I‚Äôve been realising that they‚Äôre getting pretty old‚Ä¶ Sometimes at night I imagine myself being them, and I would get an even worse panic attack, because tbh if I was them, I‚Äôd be scared shitless.  \n\nNormally, I would have panic attacks at night and sometimes I even puke or get these gag reflexes because I‚Äôm just so scared of the fact that I won‚Äôt exist anymore on this earth forever. But lately, I even get these horrible thoughts outside during the day. My legs would shiver and I have a hard time breathing because my mind just gets infected with the anxiety of death. \nI feel like life flies by so fast. It just goes one day after another and every time when I‚Äôm in bed, I just think: My god‚Ä¶ another day has passed so quickly. \n(Btw, I‚Äôm not religious and I don‚Äôt really believe in a religion‚Ä¶)\n\nI don‚Äôt want to die‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm so scared of that and I‚Äôm also scared for my relatives and my grandparents. \nI think some people just don‚Äôt realise what it means to be gone forever. You‚Äôre gone FOREVER‚Ä¶ If I could, I‚Äôd be emphasising this sentence forever, because the idea of death is just so damn scary.\n\nI‚Äôm sorry if my English was bad, it‚Äôs not my first language.\nAlso if you read this until here, I‚Äôm very grateful that you read it. And if you‚Äôre also scared of death too, just remember that there‚Äôs another guy who‚Äôs also laying in bed at night being scared with you. ",

      "selftext": "So Ive had anxiety for several years now, ever since I was in 5th grade (male btw). But back then it was just lingering thoughts of assignments at school and minor chest aches. Now it has gotten quite annoying and sometimes gets in the way of me doing normal things. For context I just started college via the Early College program, so im a little younger than a lot of others. But that doesn't bother me since most students are much more mature and lowkey nicer than in high school. Speaking of, in high school (sophomore year) I had minor nervous stomachs and only in a couple classes where I felt uncomfortable. Even when I lived in Germany (moved from usa, came back) for 8th and 9th grades I didn't feel as much anxiety as now. Anyways, my symptoms include extreme nervous stomach, diarrhea, non-stop gurgling sounds in stomach (very loud, makes me embarrassed during class and in turn makes my anxiety worse. I know its stupid). Now, at first I thought I had contracted a stomach virus because when the symptoms started I was already on my third week of college doing fine. But it has been over a month now and the symptoms are not going away. I have heard of a thing called the gut-brain axis some people experience where if you feel anxious your stomach will act up and vice versa. So Idk if its my stomach having issues or me being anxious all the time. Even if I think about going to the select few classes in college I dont like, my stomach starts acting up. I really have no clue if I should go to the doctor or if its all in my head and i can help myself. Need some advice tho, thanks.",

I've been perscribed 30 2mg Valium pills a month for the past year. I can't say I have a consistent use schedule. I've mainly used them sporadically (sometimes a few times a week, other days very large dose in one day, or using up my perscription in two weeks) up until few weeks ago (I use 1mg a day ever since I tore my acl and meniscus and was told I need surgery on the 23rd). \n\nI have been extremely anxious because I just tore my acl for the third time and will need surgery again. And I have to trim more of meniscus out (Only have 50% as it is). And I'm more anxious because I no longer csn workout to help my stress and anxiety. I was lifting and doing brazillian jiu jitzu and these hobbies helped me be fit, meet new people, and have thrill of improving at something.  \n\nAnd Idk how ill take care of myself after surgery bc I cant walk for 6 weeks. I'm more anxious now than I ever have been bc of that, and the uncertainty of the future, while being a full time college student. Basically saying because of that injury, I've been extremely depressed and anxious, and my benzo use has gone up, and I want to get off before my addiction is too deep. \n\nI understand how the benzo taper method works but I am perscribed 20mg Vyvanse and two 10mg  adderall boosters. If I taper off the benzos, wouldnt the anxiety from withdrawl be made way worse by the stimulants? Or the reverse, if I just temporarily stopped the stimulants, wouldnt thst cause bad anxiety as well, especially during a benzo taper?\n",

It is a very understimated disease.  \nAs others, I dont know how to dissociate it from my own personality and especially, my flaws.  \nI dont know how to get better, no \"solution\" never lasts. I¬¥m medicated, I do therapy, I have an incredible boyfriend. I have artistic talents and spiritual beliefs. Nothing get me out of a blurred area, where I get a little bit better and them drop to the abyss again.  \nOne of the biggest issues, is my preocupation about money. I¬¥m poor, I got a degree in law at the best university of latin america and yet, made no money out of it. I couldn¬¥t succeed in that area, in any way.  \nNow I¬¥m unemployed, lost my two jobs. My grandma, who is pretty much my mother, is signing dementia and was diagnose with lung cancer last week.\n\nIt¬¥s not just anxiety, its depression and poverty.

      "selftext": "Hey everyone, it‚Äôs been about a month since my last post and I wanted to give an update because things finally make sense now.\n\nWhen I first posted, I was convinced my blood sugar was dropping too low. I kept feeling awful, shaky, sweaty, lightheaded, weak, hot, head pressure, and that starving feeling. But every time I checked, my numbers were fine, usually in the 70s or 80s. Every once in a while I‚Äôd see a reading in the 60s, but my doctor thinks that‚Äôs just normal variation or testing error. It didn‚Äôt make sense and honestly made me scared of my own body.\n\nAfter following up with my doctor and keeping track for a few weeks, we figured out what‚Äôs actually going on. My body does the normal thing where blood sugar dips a little and releases adrenaline to keep it stable, but my nervous system is way too sensitive to that adrenaline. My brain picks up on those sensations and panics, which causes even more adrenaline, and that‚Äôs what makes me feel like I‚Äôm crashing even when I‚Äôm not.\n\nIt explains everything. Why I can feel horrible for an hour but still function, why my numbers never go below 70, and why the symptoms ease so fast once I calm down or see a normal reading. If it was true hypoglycemia, I wouldn‚Äôt be walking around fine or driving home through it.\n\nLooking back I think the CGM errors really messed with my head. Seeing those numbers jump all over the place made me lose trust in my own body, and that fear stuck with me for weeks. The 50s I saw after climbing stairs with cold hands didn‚Äôt help either. I think those readings were false, but they planted a lot of doubt that I‚Äôm still working through.\n\nSo yeah, it turns out it wasn‚Äôt reactive hypoglycemia or anything metabolic. It‚Äôs health anxiety mixed with adrenaline sensitivity. My body has been fine all along, it‚Äôs just my brain‚Äôs alarm system that‚Äôs been too loud. The difference now is I understand it, and it actually feels manageable for the first time.\n\nIf anyone else is stuck in that same ‚Äúlow feeling but normal numbers‚Äù loop, it might be worth looking into how anxiety and adrenaline can mimic it. I wish I had known this sooner.",

      "selftext": "I‚Äôve struggled with anxiety on and off since I was little. This past Monday, I began having anxiety. It didn‚Äôt go away, and it has come back every day since. It comes and goes in waves throughout the day, but even when I feel ‚Äúok‚Äù there is that lingering feeling of ‚Äúwhen is it going to come back?‚Äù \nThis has happened to me one other time, a few years ago. My doctor prescribed Lexapro and Hydroxyzine 25mg. I still take 10mg Lexapro daily, but I want to ask about tapering off. The hydroxyzine was a life saver and after taking it regularly (i don‚Äôt remember how long, maybe a week or two?) i was able to get back to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. The hydroxyzine has worked for me up until this ‚Äúepisode‚Äù of anxiety. \nI have a doctor appt tomorrow, it is with a doctor that is not my primary because i wanted to get seen ASAP. I have a note in my phone of what I want to discuss. I mostly want a med that will actually calm me down and let my nervous system ‚Äúreset‚Äù. I don‚Äôt want to be dependent on meds, but I have barely been eating and having trouble sleeping due to this. I know it will get better and everyone is telling me that, but it‚Äôs so hard to see a way out or to imagine being ‚Äúnormal‚Äù again when it‚Äôs gripping me this hard. \nNormally I am able to handle my anxiety, and it doesn‚Äôt last for days and days. \nI‚Äôve also started seeing a counselor, went to the gym, done yoga, journaled, tried L-Theanine, tried to stay busy with chores. It‚Äôs like there‚Äôs something going haywire that won‚Äôt let me relax and go back to baseline. If the doctor doesn‚Äôt bring it up, I am going to ask about Xanax or Ativan. My aunt takes Xanax and she says it‚Äôs been a lifesaver. I‚Äôm sure it would work for me but of course the anxiety is telling me that it won‚Äôt.\nI guess I want to know:\n1) if you‚Äôve taken xanax and how it worked,\nand 2) if you‚Äôve ever been in this constant state of anxiety that seems like it won‚Äôt go away but then it did, how did you get out of it?\nThank you in advance, i‚Äôm willing to do anything to get back to just being me again. <3",

      "title": "How do I become the man my family needs me to be?",
      "selftext": "Hi everyone,\nI‚Äôm 25, and lately I‚Äôve been struggling with something that I think a lot of men feel but rarely talk about. I don‚Äôt really feel like a ‚Äúman.‚Äù Not in the sense of age or biology ‚Äî but emotionally, mentally, and even physically.\n\nFinancially, I‚Äôm doing okay. I have a job, and I support my family. But when I look deeper, I feel like I‚Äôm not the kind of man I want to be ‚Äî the kind my family can depend on when things get hard.\n\nTo give some background ‚Äî I was the most pampered kid in my family. I was born after a lot of difficulties, so my mother and sisters always treated me like the most precious one. I was constantly protected and taken care of. I don‚Äôt blame them for it ‚Äî they did it out of love ‚Äî but because of that, I never learned to handle life independently. I didn‚Äôt get many chances to make mistakes, face things alone, or grow tough.\n\nNow, that‚Äôs showing up in my adult life.\nEmotionally, I‚Äôm very sensitive. I don‚Äôt cry loudly, but tears come to my eyes very easily. Even when something emotional happens in a movie, or to someone I barely know, I feel it deeply ‚Äî too deeply. If something painful happens to someone close to me, I literally carry that pain as if it‚Äôs my own.\n\nI know empathy is a good thing, but in my case, I think I have too much of it. It‚Äôs exhausting.\n\nWhen my mother had a major surgery recently, I wanted to be strong for her ‚Äî the ‚Äúman of the family‚Äù ‚Äî but I couldn‚Äôt. I broke down several times. I tried to hide it, but my emotions always found their way out. I wanted to give her strength and positivity, but instead I was the one crying silently in the corner.\n\nEven in my last relationship, my emotions and overthinking ruined things. I overthink literally everything ‚Äî every word, every text, every situation. My mind always goes straight to the worst-case scenario. I‚Äôm a very negative thinker. I don‚Äôt see positives easily; I imagine everything that could go wrong instead. And honestly, that mindset has messed me up mentally.\n\nIf I‚Äôm being real ‚Äî I think the only thing currently going right in my life is my job. Everything else feels like chaos in my head.\n\nI also struggle a lot with indecision. I can‚Äôt make decisions confidently ‚Äî not even small ones. I still ask my family before buying something simple. I depend too much on their approval. It makes me feel like I‚Äôm still a kid trapped in an adult‚Äôs body.\n\nPhysically, I‚Äôm also weak. I have a very lean body and haven‚Äôt yet joined the gym, though I‚Äôve been thinking about it. I want to be stronger ‚Äî not just emotionally, but physically too. I want to build that kind of confidence that comes from knowing you can handle yourself and protect others if needed.\n\nAnother thing that really bothers me is fear. If I ever get into an argument or confrontation ‚Äî even with a stranger who‚Äôs clearly wrong ‚Äî my heart starts racing. I instantly get scared, thinking, What if this person hits me? or What if something bad happens? I hate that feeling. I don‚Äôt want to live in fear.\n\nIt‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm weak inside ‚Äî it‚Äôs that I‚Äôve never trained myself to be strong. I want to change that.\n\nI want to be calm, confident, and emotionally grounded.\nI want to be the kind of man who can stand strong when his family is falling apart.\nThe kind who brings peace instead of panic.\n\nSo I just want to ask honestly ‚Äî how do I become that man?\nHow do I build emotional and mental strength? How do I stop overthinking and fearing everything?\nHow do I start taking charge of my own life, make my own decisions, and become someone reliable?\n\nIf anyone has been in a similar place and managed to change ‚Äî please tell me what helped.\nWas it therapy? Gym? Discipline? Meditation?\nAnything real and practical that made a difference ‚Äî I‚Äôm ready to try it.\n\nI‚Äôm not asking for sympathy. I just want to grow up ‚Äî not in age, but in strength.\nI want to finally become the man my family needs me to be.\n\nThank you for reading this far. It really means a lot.",

The honking from others behind me literally kills me. Am I not allowed to think about my own safety? All of this makes me panic, and every time I think about driving, this comes to my mind and I just drop my plans. ",

We both felt weird about it but we just ignored it and played it off as a joke, but a couple of days ago my friend told him to stop and that the joke is over and he seemed fine with it until I asked him to play yesterday to which he said \"why are you stalking a minor\" and I was really shocked bc it made me think if he ever treated the whole wife thing as a joke? I feel so disgusted w myself now for entertaining the joke bc I'd say stuff like \"she was my wife first\" (referring to my friend). Also the first time he said marry me to her I said something like \"whens the wedding\"...\n\nEver since yesterday I've been so anxious to the point where I wanted to throw up bc I'm scared that this was grooming?

I let it all out and spoke about it, and a minute later the panic hit me. I didn‚Äôt understand what was happening‚Äîmy heart was pounding, my hands were numb, and fear took over.\nSince then, nothing has felt the same. I‚Äôm on edge all the time, worrying that it will happen again. It drives me crazy, but I‚Äôve avoided medication because I fear the long-term effects. I just want to feel normal again.\nI have a great job and I graduated college, yet I suffer in silence most days. Only a few people know, and my therapist knows everything. I‚Äôve cut nicotine, caffeine, and anything that speeds my heart, which has crushed my morale, though the anxiety has reduced somewhat.\n\nToday at work, there were paramedics and ambulances for another employee, and that moment triggered my anxiety‚Äîsuddenly, out of nowhere. It‚Äôs manageable, but it‚Äôs incredibly hard. I used to think people with anxiety just needed to ‚Äúlock in,‚Äù but my body doesn‚Äôt listen to me sometimes, and that‚Äôs painful.\n\nI‚Äôm an officer in the military and a supervisor at my job, and I want to get better. I‚Äôm exhausted and my morale is at an all-time low, but I‚Äôm making progress. I don‚Äôt see an end, though. A mentor told me that leadership isn‚Äôt about the challenges you face, but about how you fight through them and still lead‚Äîand I‚Äôve clung to those words.\n\nI want to enjoy coffee again, and I want to have a drink with my friends, but I feel chained by this. I can drive now without severe anxiety and I can work, but it still appears in waves and triggers. My morale is at its lowest it‚Äôs ever been. Please tell me if all my efforts will be in vain and if I‚Äôll deal with this forever.",

Shaking, dizziness, heart pounding, sweating, feeling faint, etc. Since then, my anxiety has slowly gotten better but generally increased. So it‚Äôs been 6 months. \n\nAnyway, I was starting to feel off about 2 weeks ago. More anxious than usual. Got blood drawn and had high lymphocytes which mean white blood cells fighting something. Saturday night (3 days after blood test), I get slammed with insane derealization/ depersonalization, shaking for 2+ hours, lots of diarrhea. Felt ok Sunday. Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday INSANE anxiety. Took myself to ER Wednesday. Shook again like crazy for hours that night. Cried because I felt I was going insane. Several days of derealisation. Didn‚Äôt feel like myself at all. Extreme terror honestly. Diarrhea never stopped. So I had it from Saturday-Saturday. On Thursday I started chugging electrolytes and forcing myself to eat a bit, and taking this medicine called Nifuroxazide and a probiotic. I think it slowly helped. Today, 1 week since the initial symptoms were exacerbated and 3-4 days of actively treating, I feel better. Wtf is this?!?!",

      "selftext": "We were supposed to move to Canada (has been planning for the past 7 years) but didn't due to my husband developing anxiety disorder and barely sleeping. For the past few months he has been going back and forth about moving. He is worried about the kids only having American passports, but also worried about how to make a living in Canada. I think we will do alright either way since I can work my job anywhere, which would at least tie us over until he finds another source of income. Canada and the US each has its own pros and cons for us, and it's not a life or death decision.\n\nI tried let him choose and he would just be like \"I want to move, but...\". When I said ok let's stay he would sulk and look depressed and be like \"I think the kids  will be better off in the long term in Canada\". And he has been going circles for the past four months.\n\nA month ago he sold our car in anticipation for the move, only to buy another car two weeks later because he wants focus on staying and going back to his old job. I suggested getting a rental for a bit but he would not listen We lost a few thousand due to this. The same night he bought the new car he already regretted. He has been on leave for two months and the organization he worked for allowed him back, and he is worry about not meeting expectations and getting fired due to his expectations.\n\nHe is interviewing for a company in Canada which he feels good about. Now he is saying that maybe his anxiety will lessen after he moves. WTF??? I m losing it. Essentially now we only have three weeks left to move so we can meet residence requirement after which we will be at the mercy of the Canadian government to revoked our resident status. And of course he doesn't want to give up and wants to hire lawyers to look for ways to extend it. I m so exhausted. I think we are wasting money. He is seeing psychology and psychiatrist and been on medication but they don't help much. \n\nI want to be supportive but it's very maddening. I told him since he has bought the car back (which I begged him to not) he needs to stay here and work to at least pay it down a bit. He would sulk and he said he is not sure he can work. (Ok, but why buy the car back?) I told him if he can get an actual job offer in canada we could move, otherwise that's it. He would be trembling when I say this. I don't know what to do. If he gets worse, he may need to go to the hospital. I heard there is a long line for mental illness treatment in Canada. I don't know if I m doing the right thing putting my foot down. Nothing I do seem to help. \n\nIf you have anxiety about making decisions, what has helped you?",

He's incredibly excited about it, but I find myself spiraling almost every day now for the past week or two. For a while, I was excited about the move because I have more job opportunities, better community, and more things to do. All of that excitement seems to have gone out the window when we started putting things into boxes.\n\nI can't seem to go through a small handful of  things without anxiety taking over. I start shaking, my stomach is in knots, and I just want to cry. These things aren't even objects that are coming with us; they're things that we've been needing to get rid of for years. If I can't even deal with that, how am I going to feel when we are packing away the things that are actually coming with us? The items we use daily? We're still figuring out the logistics of the move (getting movers, determining when our official move in day is, etc) and when he presents these conversations to me, I just freeze up.\n\nMy partner is incredibly supportive and understanding of my reactions to this and I've been seeing a therapist for general anxiety (although we've discussed the move a lot). At the end of the day though, I find myself not wanting to do this because there are far too many unknowns. I've been looking at job boards almost daily but I'm not qualified for anything (finances aren't a problem but it's part of the reason we're moving).  We don't know anyone there and we don't even know that much about the area we're moving to.\n\nThis will be the furthest move I've ever made, which isn't really saying much. I moved for college but I was ready to be on my own and even now I'm still only an hour away from my hometown. With those moves though, I was able to maintain friendships because they were either heading to the same place, or at least near enough that seeing them was easy. Now after about 5 years in our current place, we've made more friends that are going to be a lot harder to see. We're losing gatherings with people that we see at least twice a week and it already hurts knowing that we're leaving it behind.\n\nHonestly even just posting this has helped a little bit with the anxiety that I'm just coming down from. How have you managed to combat anxiety with bigger moves? What should I be doing about these unknowns like finding a job or being comfortable in a city significantly larger than where we currently are?  Any advice or positive words are welcome ‚ù§Ô∏è",

      "selftext": "Hey ya'll. Jumping right in, I've had anxiety for 16 years. It went into kind of a remission (?) Where I wouldnt have the absolute debilitating anxiety attacks after a few years, but would occasionally flare up in the concern over others (like when we had little kids and they were sick, that sort of thing). \n\nIts been a rough end of August-now, son was rear-ended on the highway and needed surgery on his nose, he needs another surgery on his nose in a couple months, my grandpa died, then my son had a terrible broken finger last week playing football and needed another surgery. I've also had a couple illnesses that I tried to fight out on my own because I was just so swamped by everything else to go to the Dr.\n\n Last Sunday night I had an anxiety attack. That convinced me I needed to take my bloodpressure (big mistake). It was like 160/100. Not good, I know. So i drove myself to the ER for the first time due to anxiety, they did some blood work, EKG, said everything was fine except my white blood cells count was high, but I had started doxycycline on Monday for an assumed sinus infection. I've had anxiety every day since. I'll get my pulse in my ears, nausea, upper back pain, pressure in my head, i'm convinced my eyes are blurry, and just dont feel right. \n\nMy husband planned this huge trip for us flying out on Tuesday and I just dont know how i'm going to do it. I've tried therapy before, they just wanted to kick me off to someone that could prescribe meds. I've got no one to talk to about this. I dont know how i'm going to not ruin this trip. I dont know how to stop googling what the EKG couldve missed that is lurking in the corner. I dont know how to be normal. \n\nI just want to not ruin this trip. I want to be back to the way I was 2 weeks ago. I'm so depressed that I just want to hide and sleep. Anybody successfully pull themselves out of a nasty tailspin? I've cut my smoking by at least a third, workout every day, started doing yoga, and am trying to get more sleep. The anxiety monster in my mental closet is whispering that since none of those are working, the doctor missed something. The rational part of me is trying to figure out how i'm going to ride this out, especially with flying in the near future. \n\nThanks to anyone who has some suggestions or reassurance. ",

This was pattern every couple months clean I‚Äôd get anxious again and felt like I need my medication but Prozac is meant to work over a long period of time so I just would suffer. I got prescribed buspar for as needed this summer but it doesn‚Äôt do shit. Mind you, my parents are immigrants who are just starting to be woke and they don‚Äôt believe in medication for anxiety or therapy, they believe it‚Äôs for kids with alcoholic, drug addiction, divorced parents. What‚Äôs stopping me from reaching out to my provider is that contacting her saying it doesn‚Äôt work for me means I have to go in, have an appointment, parents need to pay co-pay or whatever and then having to buy the medication. I feel like they‚Äôll blow me off and say I‚Äôm being dramatic. I think therapy would be good for me but again my parents have permitted me to have medication but they won‚Äôt let me have therapy because that‚Äôs a disgrace.

With all these earthquakes happening, I can‚Äôt help but think about my own situation. The West Valley Fault runs really close to where I live, and our house is just 74 meters away from it. Experts have been warning about ‚Äúthe Big One‚Äù for years, saying it‚Äôs due anytime, and that thought keeps replaying in my head.\n\nEarlier today, I bought several emergency items online and started slowly packing go bags for my mom and me. I‚Äôm not done yet, and I‚Äôm planning to buy more stuff tomorrow to complete them. I thought preparing would make me feel better, but instead it‚Äôs making everything feel more real.\n\nNow it‚Äôs night, and I can‚Äôt sleep. My mind won‚Äôt shut up. I keep thinking of what might happen, how bad it could get, and if we‚Äôll even survive it. I‚Äôve cried a bit already, partly because of fear, but also because I feel jealous of people who seem to be living normally. They‚Äôre out laughing, making plans, doing their usual routines, while I‚Äôm here preparing for the worst and expecting the ground to destroy everything I know.\n\nIt feels like living with an invisible timer that no one can see or predict. I‚Äôm trying to stay strong and practical, but deep down I‚Äôm just scared. Scared for my mom, scared of what might happen, and scared of not knowing when it will come.",

I was told to get back on a anti depressant so two days ago i went to my psychiatrist and she gave me 10mg Lexapro but told me to split it into 5mg doses since im super sensitive to medications. (She opted for lexapro cause I didn't respond well to Zoloft and was numb on prozac)\n\nAnyways.. even tho I was scared to take it, I took my 1st dose yesterday at noon and after 40 minutes, I was getting extremely hot, nausous and worked up. I had to linger in the bathroom for a hour cause I really thought I was about to puke (which gives me more anxiety cause im scared of throwing up) but luckily my fiance called me, talked me thru it and I felt better. For the rest of the day the nausea came in small waves but I managed.. until bedtime hit. I fell asleep but woke up every hour feeling nauseous, having loud tummy gurgling and diarrhea with cramps. I lay in bed now, 2 hours away from when im supposed to take my second dose with a heating pad, terrible stomach pain and this nagging feeling every 10 minutes that makes me feel like I'll vomit. Im so scared to take my 2nd dose today but am trying to convince myself to push thru this because maybe it'll be worth it. If anyone has any positive outcomes after dealing with a similar situation please let me know, I just want lexapro to work but this stomach stuff is awful.",

I take Xanax but my doc won‚Äôt increase it anymore (been on 1mg as needed for years) and definitely have built up a tolerance. The only thing that gives me very short term relief is that. I do have some weird genetic processing of meds but even after doing. Some gene testing, not so much luck. The only med I have had luck with was celexa at the max dose, my anxiety did basically go away but I literally could not stay awake. I even got a stimulant provided but still could not stay away. I‚Äôm on prisitiq now but I feel like most of these meds that haven‚Äôt given me bad side effects have only helped very little. I have done cbt, do therapy regularly, work out daily, lost weight, use supplements and I just want to not worry. I have bad healthy anxiety, especially with the heart, as I get lots of palpitations (PVCs) that have gotten much worse and docs are making me do a lot more testing and as anyone with anxiety knows, waiting is crushing. Anywho, just venting I guess. If anyone is the same and has had a drug that has worked after many, please let me know! I‚Äôve tried, viibrid, celexa, buspar, propranolol, auvelity, Wellbutrin, topamax, etc. thank you!",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI‚Äôve been managing anxiety and panic attacks for years (around 15+), and one thing I still can‚Äôt quite figure out is what actually makes things better or worse.\n\nSome days I feel calmer after a walk or some exercise. Other days, even when I do all the ‚Äúright‚Äù things, the anxiety still hits out of nowhere. I often wish there was an easy way to look back and see patterns ‚Äî like whether drinking the night before, lack of sleep, or stress at work played a part.\n\nI‚Äôve been thinking about creating something that helps people track this more simply ‚Äî daily check-ins, notes about symptoms and triggers, and maybe even community-shared tips that have actually helped others. I'm thinking also having an AI assistant to talk you through a panic attack or answer questions when you‚Äôre spiralling.\n\nBefore I go any further, I‚Äôd really love to get some honest feedback from people who understand this firsthand:\n\n* Would something like this actually feel *helpful*, or just like another app to remember to use?\n* When you‚Äôre anxious or in a panic attack, what kind of support would you actually want from an app?\n* Have you tried any other apps and if so did you find them a bit fluffy and almost childish like I did?\n\n\n\nNot here to sell anything ‚Äî just genuinely curious if this kind of tool would make sense in the real world. Appreciate any thoughts or experiences you‚Äôre open to sharing üíô",

I don't get much enjoyment out of doing things like watching TV because I'm too restless, and going out to do things feels extra stressful.

It‚Äôs also really close to a scar I have from a breast biopsy I had 3 years ago. I also get shock like pains randomly in my body and have since I was a kid. Thought it was normal I guess. And I have been feeling like I‚Äôm having a harder time breathing, but when I think about breathing and breathing deeply, I‚Äôm fine and can take full deep breaths. \n\nAm I okay? ü•∫ I am worried but my husband thinks I‚Äôm likely fine. I just am worried about it. \n\n\n\n",

I even thought it is some postpartum thing where my heart is impacted due to giving birth but all my test came clear.\n\nThen came the acceptance part. I finally accepted that I am an anxious person. And things started getting better after that. Won't say I am 100 percent better but much better now. Even now the moment I step out of the house the first thought is not where we are going but rather how am I feeling but now I know how to ask my brain to shut up. ",

It‚Äôs something I have struggled with everyday for about two and half years now. Everyday I am finding ways to get around it and stop myself from gagging.

One night he said we had to stay in his dad‚Äôs apartment in the city while the house was being painted. The trouble was, we had to public transport after dark. \nI was freaking out.

Turns out I was just having a panic attack. I was there for 3 hours and they ran an EKG, did x-rays, and a blood test. All came back okay (except for low potassium but thats been fixed.) \n\nDespite that, the panic attacks haven't stopped. Almost every day, though the severity heavily varies. Caffeine makes it worse (obviously, and ive since cut any caffinated sodas from my diet and I didnt drink coffee to begin with). Since that hospital visit, I've gotten a blood sugar test, which came back normal, and another blood test, again all normal. \n\nI've been trying to hard to keep it under control and go to my classes which ive been relatively successful in, but im tired of constantly thinking Im dying. Any time my heart is beating too slow, beating too fast, beating \"weirdly\", light pain anywhere, chest feels tight, im just full from eating, Any \"weird\" thing my body does, my brain goes on some wild rant and I have to force myself to relax, which im not very good at, or I spiral. \n\nTLDR: Im going crazy with my panic attacks and I just want them to stop. \n\nAny advice would be nice or anything that could help put a stop to this, or make me relax about some of the symptoms.

It's frustrating because I after a few hours it goes and I feel way better but more recently it seems like my morning anxiety is getting way worse and I don't remember morning anxiety specifically, being a problem prior to SSRIs more so just general anxiety throughout the day. I don't know if that means I should up dose, change medication or try and wean down. I do have full custody of our dog now and have to get up to walk her but prior to this morning anxiety this just wasn't really an issue for me at all in fact.\n\nTLDR lifelong anxiety, started meds 6 months ago, overall anxiety improved but morning anxiety which is new since starting meds is really horrible.",

      "title": "Dealing With Body Image As a Skinny Guy",
      "selftext": "Being weak and skinny (18M) gets me treated like I'm weak and pathetic. I'm like 94 lbs at 5'7 so BMI of 14.7 (I'm Indian, and it's not life threatening). I am in deep shame, and I was born extremely underweight, the doctors were worried about me when I was born, according to my mom. I dream of having a good body pretty much all the time, and yet I also hate it, I feel resentful and bitter. Why? \n\nThere's this idea of a \"fix\". Fix what? Something that's broken? People in my life, those I consider dear to me like family, have told me that they want me to look more confident and stop being so weak all the time as a man, and I know that my scrawny body is a big reason behind why my very existence has screamed \"UNRELIABLE\" to everyone around me. When I bring up difficulties, like being force fed until I puked as a kid, or if I try to tell people that I didn't need to go through all this pain for no reason, they look at me with exasperated or disgusted eyes, like it was my fault that I'm skinny. It's considered cool, right? People blame fat people for being fat, cause unlike height people think it's your choice that you're ugly or hideous or weak or unreliable or not manly enough when it comes to this. Being skinny, and weak as I am also greatly affects my daily life and the smallest parts of it greatly. It runs much deeper than just being attractive. If I want to feel like I have the right to occupy space in this world, my body would have to reflect that. But, when I express resentment over the natural bias that society has for men like me, Im \"resentful\" and should just go to the gym. I was once accused of not wanting to take responsibility or something. I don't think people hold the belief I should be treated poorly, but i think ultimately due to our biology and evolution it's inevitable they do.\n\nAt the same time, when I start to suggest ideas of using the gym to run away from this pathetic self, and instead chase the physique i constantly dream of, to become someone reliable and strong and maybe attract a partner?? (Being Indian though, that's its own can of worms) and to cut away that same quality of mine that these same people dislike, people also call that toxic and that what I'm thinking of is dangerous. But then, we circle back to \"fix\" and \"corrective action\" (Meaning I am broken and wrong as I am now). I strongly dislike these two words, they trigger me. Going to the gym purely for self improvement for someone who chases validation and is overly concerned with how I am perceived is I think rather impossible. Chasing validation, esp from women is inevitable. Don't call this some unhealthy imagination or that it's in my head, these are very real issues and pain I've had to deal with in my life. It comes up often, and it's genuinely debilitating. I fail to provide value, but am resentful that Id ever have to as well. \n\nI am deeply insecure about my ability to sexually perform due to lack of physical strength and stamina, its really shameful :p. I honestly love the idea of looking good while naked, performing well, having women like me and enjoy being around me a lot. I've wanted to at least try having an ideal male body once, or for the rest of my life? If there was a pill to make me ripped, I guess I'd take it\n\nI feel that I am in between two choices. I am like a ping pong ball being bounced around both these ideas, and the people who talk to me about my body or whenever the subject is brought up, they have both opinions at the same time. What is the resolution behind this dilemma? I would greatly appreciate your input here if you have any insights to offer.\n\nPS Id written this a while ago so I've somewhat warmed up to the idea of a gym, but I haven't started yet as getting out of bed is rough. I still contemplate a lot of what I wrote here though.",

Took an edible, not even a lot, and I suddenly thought my friend was going to propose at La Casa Bonita. Then I thought he was telling me she (his long-term gf) was pregnant. Basically I just spiraled from there and thought that as a came down infinitesimally I was approaching death. I thought the answer to life was that it was all a joke and the greatest joke was how awesome and punk La Casa Bonita was. Then the cotton mouth hit. I thought that I'd experienced it before, but since I thought I was dying I thought I was approaching death, so I kept asking for water. I didn't want TOO much water though. Anyway, I start walking away and things are slowing down and I'm like no, no, no. This can't be it. That's too stupid to be the end. So I turned around and stepped that way. There was a hallway off to the side with a reaper on it. I said no again, turned around and it was the same one. I thought I was going to spiral to it happening faster and faster until I'm moving so exponentially fast that I end with the Universe. I ended up \"anchoring myself\" to my daughter who wasn't with me, that I could keep making deals to see her again and live to see her grow up and be amazing. So weird. I do know that I'm super into how my, lifelong, best friend is with his girlfriend. She's an amazing person and I'm so happy they're together and they're living such a fucking cool life. I appreciate that they want me to be part of it. I hope I'm not on TikTok. Guh.\n\nI also kept comparing what the two of them were saying and trying to follow the one that made me feel best about what was happening. I was waiting for the spiral to collapse or just abruptly end. Called myself an ambulance at one point. They talk me down some more. It was nice. We went to Paul McCartney, I basically say there. Still feeling I don't know what. I'm so fucked up from the whole experience and I don't know what I did and if it was too much and I ruined things, or understand more things. The anxiety spiral is at least going upwards, hopefully to where I can feel comfortable again.\n\nTl;Dr: I freaked the fuck out and thought the point of life was la Casa Bonita and kept heading towards death and then heading away from it. I'm full of electrolytes, haven't pooped in like 3 days, and am relatively calmish now. Feel like I need some therapy and to hear some good stuff right now.",

For some reason, I can‚Äôt help but focus on the opinions one or a few. Especially with the fact that I found one that, of course, claims Christianity. I wouldn‚Äôt consider myself religious, but growing up, even to now, I know the Bible has many teaching about loving your neighbors, forgiving enemies, treating others how you‚Äôd want to be treated, and, of course, caring for the marginalized. I know all of this, yet the thought scares me that they‚Äôre right (I realize they‚Äôre most likely aren‚Äôt), and I‚Äôm scared of this potentially ruining relationships because of it. I have now been taking action to actively avoid this kind of stuff. I‚Äôve even looked at other ACTUAL Christian‚Äôs takes on these kinds of issues to have some clarity.

I was away for college, constant around friends , and having the time of my life. I came home May and immediately had to pick up a full time job working over night 12 hour shifts sometimes 5 days a week in a Medical lodge. At first it was fine , then out of nowhere , i started having bad chest pains and anxiety. (I‚Äôve had a panic disorder for about 8 years now. I had a fully work up at the cardiologist then and nothing came up. This was 8 years ago). Fast forward now, i‚Äôm 19, and had to quit my job because my anxiety has gotten so bad. I get these random sharp pains when breathing in, random headaches and head pains , sometimes isolated to one side of the head or one place, i get pain when moving my eye, i get hand pain, tbh the list goes on and on. every time i get one pain , i think ‚Äúis it an aneurysm, a tumor, a heart attack‚Äù?

      "title": "Eating only whole foods significantly reduced my social anxiety for two weeks! (but I've fallen off)",
      "selftext": "Hello,\n\nI'm a college student whose had social anxiety disorder for a long time. It really reduced my quality of life in high school, because I was just scared of social situations. The summer before college, I knew that I had to do something because I knew I'd get depressed if I had to deal with social anxiety in college.\n\nI did a bunch of research (on Reddit lol) and heard stories about others putting their anxiety in remission through supplements, exercise, weird diet choices (e.g. eating of sardines everyday), etc. I started noting these down to come up with an \"anti-anxiety\" plan.\n\nThe plan ended up falling apart (my home mostly had a bunch of processed food and I didn't committ to exercise)\n\nI entered college still feeling anxious.\n\nCollege became a huge trigger for my social anxiety. Walking around campus, I'd constantly see people talking to each other and being in friend groups. This had never happened to me before, but every time I saw this it reminded me of what I was unable to do. Usually, I'd only be anxious in social situations, but fine otherwise. This was the first time I actually became depressed even when not in a social situation because, I'd ruminate on how I wasn't able to be social. This is the worst I've ever been affected. I also started developing more physical anxiety symptoms that I hadn't noticed before (more tenseness, a nervous feeling/stomach, and faster heart beat)\n\nI started to go back to the \"research\" I'd done and bought a few supplements I heard help: magnesium glycinate, vitamin d+k2, and fish oil. I took each every day (the fish oil supplement 3 times a day with meals), hoping that I'd get the magical remission I'd heard others got online, but it didn't come. I felt no different (maybe my sleep was a bit better). That sucked. I also wanted to start exercise, but was really inconsistent.\n\nYou may be wondering, why I hadn't tried therapy or medication, the two most common treatments for social anxiety. Well, the first reason was probably laziness/not wanting to socialize (shown by me buying supplements, but not exercising). The other reason was that I tried to open up to my primary care doctor, but the whole appointment was cold and she just kind of dismissed it and said to maybe meditate. She also recommended reaching out for on-campus resources, but those resources are heavily booked. There's a huge waiting list.\n\nContinuing to research, I chanced on two Reddit threads. One where a person claimed paleo cured 16 years of depression and anxiety. Another one had a comment that recommended the book Change Your Diet Change Your Mind by Georgia Ede. I got the book and was excited to have a more in-depth resource (not just Reddit anecdotes). I started following her Quiet Paleo diet and within a few days, I woke up suddenly and noticed no I had no social anxiety. It was crazy. Those physical symptoms I had were just not there anymore. When I was walking on campus and saw people socializing, it didn't affect me; the ruminating thoughts I had dropped by 80% and when they popped up I was able to recognize that they were just silly thoughts. I also suddenly became more social. I was initiating conversations with multiple people on my floor and getting to know them. I remember fist bumping after the first few times this happened because I was so surprised by myself. I saw a group of people in the lounge area watching a movie and was just able to... walk in... and start conversing with them for 30 minutes. Now we're friends. I've also been chatting up people in my classes and just haven't been afraid of normal social interactions I would have been scared of before. My social anxiety was just... basically gone. This happened for maybe a week and a half to two weeks.\n\nBut then it came to a stop. I went home for the weekend and slipped. I ate foods with a lot of sugar and refined carbs and just generally junk. I fell off the bandwagon when I got back to school too, eating bread and drinking some sugary drinks. The anxiety immediately came back. I'm having the same physical symptoms / ruminating thoughts / fear of social situations I had two weeks ago. I'm anxious to talk to people I was friendly with last week, scared that I'll suddenly mess up.\n\nTrying to commit to the diet again, and hopefully I can stick with it.\n\n**important:**¬†I also want to say that I know that diet is not some magical solution for everybody and that medication/therapy/etc. are really good for other people. Again, a big reason why I didn't pursue that path was simply because I was too socially anxious to push for help, not because I don't think it works. Also, even though this has been debilitating, I'm lucky I never got to the point where I'd completely isolate myself and I remember always having a desire to talk to people (even though there's a force preventing me from doing so).\n\nJust wanted to share this. Even though I'm feeling anxious right now, those two weeks were the best and I'm working towards that again. I finally was able to experience what it would be like for the anxiety to just... not be there.\n\nDo you guys have any experiences with reducing symptoms with interventions like diet, exercise, and perhaps meditation?",

      "selftext": "\n\n\n\nI'm 28 and have been living in isolation for nearly 10 yrs. I've dealt with fears of driving, fear of being seen, and deep shame for not having a normal life. My parents passed away recently and I have no work experience beyond a short job working at retail store. \n\nI want to change. I did apply few jobs already despite I felt very resistant. But I was hoping to find a open job at office or remote work. I'm also trying to overcome the fear of driving and social anxiety. \n\nI feel very stuck overwhelmed and sometimes hopeless but I know this isn't the way of living life. My concern is how do I rebuild myself and where do I start all this. ",

I'm working on getting over that, but that's not why I'm posting today. \n\nNaturally, due to the flying fear, I try to take the 2 hour ferry ride as much as possible.

I'm a wreck. \n\nLogically I know it's pretty safe. Our ferry has strict guidelines they follow, they're equipped with life jackets, rings, and life boats. But damn, if that boat sways, the panic hits. None of the other passengers seem nervous in the moment, so I'm guessing it's all pretty normal and this is a me problem. \n\nI'm supposed to be taking a trip tomorrow and I've just been overcome with anxiety and dread about it.

My pediatrician recommended going on meds for it multiple times but due to family reasons I never went on them. I got a psychiatric service dog and I could finally leave the house (it was hard but I did it!) for the first time in a long time. I was making progress with my social anxiety, I got to the point I could talk to people asking me questions about my dog and even order my own food!! Unfortunately he was attacked by an off leash dog leading to him needing to be retired early. That's set me back a ton. It's been a year since he's stopped working and my whole world has just collapsed. \n\nMy family thought I've been doing well because I was still leaving the house, I got a boyfriend (now ex), Ive been hanging out with friends. But during that time I've been so shut down I wasn't even taking in what anyone was saying to me, I dissociate, go to the bathroom when I feel a panic attacks coming on then putting a mask on and pretend I didn't just feel like I was dying because I don't want them to see that I'm struggling so bad again, I don't want to lose more people over this. It's completely controlling my life.\n\nIt wasn't until yesterday that I realised my anxiety was overtaking my emotions so much that it felt like I wasn't even there, like I wasn't existing, had no control over my own body and was just a spectator over my own life. I so desperately need help but don't know what to say or how to get it",

I feel joy towards next to nothing, the only 2 things are running and cooking my cultures food. Which is very seasoned, often spicy. I decided after going on the r/gerd page that i must have gerd and am doomed to a bland diet and will need to stop running. Now ive been feeling the symptoms constantly, every stuck burp feeling, focusing on if i feel a burn in my throat. Staying up til 5am going back and forth between panic attacks and internet searches. I got prescribed famatodine but im afraid to take it. Im already on prozac 30mg and after 4 years i think its becoming less effective. I am relapsing with eating disorder thoughts, ive already starved myself into heart arrhythmia in the past and i am absolutely NOT supposed to do restrictive diets and the thought of having to do so and losing weight (i drop weight VERY quick idk why) is giving me stress from hell. I cannot do this restrictive gerd diet, i cant do elimination diets, im gonna end up offing myself if i have to its that bad. Please someone give me some kind of hope or advice because i am fucked up rn. \nEdit to add: i am also autistic, i do very bad with change and discomfort and im sorry this sounds so woe is me. Running is what keeps me out of the damn psych ward and ive been able to go years without an ed relapse. I dont wanna go back to that, i just wanna finally enjoy my life. ",

I already know for some reason coffee makes me sleepy, so before I got to work I randomly decided to go to starbucks and down a chai tea latte with a single. And when I got to work most of my anxious thoughts were gone? It's like they all went into a big fuzzy cloud or something and out of my mind (idk how to explain it). And I felt much more relaxed and calm and I lasted the whole work day without any more anxiety or panic. I may as well have drunk a gallon of chamomile tea or something.\n\nLike, is this just me? Or is something fundamentally wrong with my brain. I mean I guess I can't complain since coffee is easy to get but idk I'm just confused as hell",

      "selftext": "**Short while ago, I've found out info about vagus nerve and how it can help with anxiety and overall mood.** Since I've known this my anxiety symptoms decreased rapidly. Remember that if your body is in state of anxiety it won't try to \"expand\" in any area of life, the body will be focused on survival, rather than trying to achieve anything. Our brain is complex, but yet in some situations reacts very simply, if you see a bear, the first thing your body will try to do is survive, in that moment you won't have any thoughts about how to achieve your goals, how to improve your relationships or what career path you should choose. This means that, that in state of everyday anxiety, it will be a lot harder to do even the easiest things.\n\n**What is vagus nerve?**  \nVagus nerve is one of the most important nerves in body, connecting your brain to nearly all major organs. It controls mood and stress response,rest, recovery, digestions etc. If your vagus nerve is functioning well, your body can easily switch between stress and relaxation.\n\n**Why is vagus nerve such a big deal?**  \nIt's because your nervous system has 2 modes\n\n1. Sympathetic - fight or flight (stress, survival, anxiety, action)\n2. Parasympathetic - rest, recover and digest (healing, focus, peace, calmness) If your body cannot switch correctly between those two, **YOU ARE COOKED!** A lot of people have high cortisol while sleeping and that's the reason why they wake up tired, weak and in bad mood. Imagine how many things are messed up because of **sympathetic mode** being active most of the day.\n\n**What are common signs of weak vagus nerve?**  \nStress or anxiety  \nBad digestion or bloating  \nFatigue  \nBrain fog  \netc.\n\n**How to strengthen the vagus nerve?**  \nBox breathing (this was game changer for me)  \nGood posture - straight back  \nTongue on the roof of the mouth  \nCold exposure  \nMeditation  \nExercise  \netc.\n\nThis is short introduction to vagus nerve if you have any questions, I am happy to answer them in comments.

Every single day, without fail, since I have known him, he has been my support and we have been in contact, texting all day. I completely and fully mean it when I say every single day without fail. He ended up being dishonest about a lot towards the beginning, but I didn't find out until recently. Regardless, he made himself extremely extremely extremely safe for me back then even as I was very transparent about my fears of being vulnerable, being hurt, etc. and confided in him about my abandonment/attachment issues. I will not sugarcoat it, it 1000% became dependency. When we did get together, he was at my apartment every night. He moved in a few months later, when my roommate married and moved out. \n\nWe have had some really horrible fights, but on the 7th we had a fight wherein my downstairs neighbor called the police and for the first time I let them in. He was arrested. I cannot state how badly I regret opening that door. The state I am in does not play with domestic violence, and it is a state-vs-him thing rather than something I control. I did tell my advocate I really did not want a protection order or anything of the sort. But the state requested it, so it was granted. He even called me the night prior a couple of times from jail. \nHis next court date is not until the 5th of November and until then it's a complete no-contact order. Can't come home, can't text, can't call, his friends can't contact me, nothing ‚Äî and to be completely honest his absence has been way, WAY more traumatic than the scuffle we had that night, or any I've ever had in my life for that matter. This is my rock, my best friend, he was my go-to person at work, my desk is right beside his. I messaged him all day at work since we work for the same company.\nI have major depression and anxiety and until now they have both been extremely, extremely easy to handle and stable with my medication. The anxiety was basically gone. That has gone entirely out the window. I can hardly get out of bed, I feel cold throughout the inside of my body, my chest feels constantly heavy and every minute feels like agonizing hours. Every second. I can't talk to my other half. It's been two days and I feel like I'm in constant hell. ESPECIALLY since I work 12-hr-shifts where everybody is going to ask me about him. 12s are legitimately terrible on a bad day, I cannot even fathom the pain that they would be like this. I'm supposed to go back to work tomorrow. Please, please, please give me your advice. I am so lost.",

      "title": "Developing anxiety after quitting my job",
      "selftext": "Hi, this is my first time posting here. I'm pretty nervous about opening up about this, but here goes:\n\nLast months have been troublesome for me. I (26M) quit my full time job in the beginning of august to finish my bachelors degree (which I did finish succesfully, phew).\n\nWork in july was stressful, even more so because I was quitting. I worked in a made-to-measure menswear shop with a very demanding en stressed manager, who was explicitly not happy that I was quitting. I started binge drinking in that month and smoking like crazy. Partly because it was summer and there's a lot to do. Also because I was coping like crazy. \n\nIn august, I started studying again and finishing some papers. While I had about 5-6 exams, I did finish them and got my degree. (For those interested: before, I was not planning on getting my degree anymore, so I started working in the store. I did still work on my final thesis through the year and I passed in june. Then I realised I should just finish my degree and get a better job.)\n\nI noticed in july already that I was getting heart palpitations every night, not a fast heartbeat, but a really strong and scary one. And it always came in the night. During work days, I used to get light in the head sometimes, thinking I would faint. Still I went out a couple nights a week to escape reality while drinking and smoking.\n\nSince august, I couldn't stand alcohol, nicotine or cafeine anymore. I would feel ill and nervous if I'd consume any of these. So I stopped consuming and to this day haven't picked any of it back up.\n\nLate august, I barely slept one night while I had an important exam that day. I called in sick to have a better chance at a later date. That night, I went to play some music with friends to take my mind of all the stress. After just one song, I felt a pressure on my chest and my heart started skipping beats and beating irregular for half a minute. I thought that was a heart attack.\n\nI was brought to ER by some friends and was checked, also got an ECG. Nothing seemed off and I was told I was hyperventilating, maybe chronically. They linked it to stress. So they told me to go talk to a psychologist and to a physiotherapist for breathing exercises.\n\nSome time has passed now and I've gone to my personal doctor, who said I can't be doing anything till the end of november. I also have recurring meetings with my psychologist and they do help with unloading my mind. I still have to go to a physiotherapist.\n\nI've now spent the last 3 weeks away from my city to stay in nature and my mother is taking care of me. The first few days I totally crashed. I had no energy, didn't come outside, could barely walk for 5 minutes, had heart palpitations the whole night and I was prone to panick attacks. Now I get outside everyday, I'm walking a bit faster and a bit longer, but it's still not where it's supposed to be. I still have those heart palpitations (but not as bad and as often as before) and can't sleep that well. For some reason, I can only fall asleep after 2am. Before that time, I'll fall asleep but I'll be quickly awakened by some slight panick attack every time. That's the only thing that hasn't really improved in the last weeks.\n\nSidenote: I do not take any medication even though the doctor prescribed me quetiapine for sleeping. I eat healthy and varied. I drink plenty of water and no sodas. I've quit tiktok and reels since three weeks. And i have some friends who can support me.\n\nI'm hopefull. I see the progress I'm making. It feels like I'm becoming human again, only very slowly. And I won't be the same human as before, that's clear.\n\nThe reason I'm writing this, is because I want to hear if others see themselves in this story. Maybe some parts are relatable.

If you had a childhood in which the person you were supposed to love was emotionally vital, not emotionally safe or stable, and in some cases, abusive. You're going to project fear, connection, and love in the same bucket. So then every time you're in a room with people, you are going to feel a bunch of fear wherever there's room for connections. This is what is running you. \n\nWhen you dissolve this unconscious programming, you actually begin to deconstruct the mental prison and free yourself from guilt.",

      "selftext": "\nHey everyone, I wanna start this post by saying that I have really severe health anxiety and health OCD. I go straight to the worst case scenario whether it be for myself or my kids and honestly, it‚Äôs been quite debilitating and ruined. A lot of my life. I‚Äôm currently in therapy for it and I also take Medication. I‚Äôm a highly intelligent person with a full-time job, but this health anxiety can be so irrational. I went through a full crisis recently because I thought I had ALS it was ruled out by a neuromuscular specialist and I vowed that I wasn‚Äôt gonna ever go down this rabbit hole again. Yet here I am. On and off for about a month now I‚Äôve had some intermittent dull neck pain in the front of my neck on one side‚Ä¶ mostly under my jaw around the submandibular gland.  The thing that upsets me is, it is predominantly on one side. It‚Äôs often hard to pin point but it‚Äôs definitely there. I feel it randomly throughout the day. I also feel it when I turn my head, a certain way or swallow. Or touch my chin to my chest. I did exactly what I learned not to do in therapy and I compulsively went online and read stories about people who had neck ultrasounds and then were subsequently sent for biopsies and so forth. I‚Äôm obviously gonna go to my doctor to discuss this and see if a scan is indicated, but I just don‚Äôt know how to move on From This until I can get an understanding of what‚Äôs going on each day. It‚Äôs hard to function without it consuming my every thought. I‚Äôd also like to know if anybody here has experienced something similar in their neck and gotten a ultrasound just to find out it was absolutely nothing. Right now I‚Äôm thinking anything from lymphoma to some kind of weird submandibular gland cancer to rare thyroid cancer. It sucks to have these thoughts all the time and to walk around feeling like you are about to find out that you life is at risk. It doesn‚Äôt help that I am raising two kids on my own so I feel like a sense of urgency to know that I‚Äôm OK and I‚Äôm going to be there for them . ",

I can‚Äôt drink, sleep well, stay calm or present, every little smell/sound that‚Äôs slightly alarming sends me into orbit. I constantly feel like crying and like I‚Äôm going CRAZY. The best way I can describe it is that it feels like I‚Äôm grieving? But I don‚Äôt know what exactly caused it. I was starting to feel better at the beginning of August, like part of me finally was healing and moving forward. \n\nUntil I took Celexa. \n\nI started Celexa back the beginning of August and I didn‚Äôt last a week, I spent majority of that small period on the couch, waiting for the day to pass so that I could sleep and get through it. Even more anxious, tired, sick, headaches. The day I decided stopped taking the medication was when I went into a full psychotic panic. I had never felt like that in my entire life and even now, thinking about how I felt, what was going through my mind, makes me feel sick to my stomach. \n\nIts been an up hill battle since then and I have good says, but the bad days are bad. I just need some advice on how to keep my head held high through all of this and how to find myself again? Even if you have people in your life to talk to, anxiety is a very lonely experience and I know that people on here will be able to help me. I appreciate it!! ",

At night I found it harder and harder to fall asleep because my mind kept circling around the big questions of life:  \n*What am I, where do I come from? What is consciousness? What happens after death?*\n\nThe last one always hits the hardest. Thinking about death gives me this overwhelming mix of panic, helplessness, and fear.  \nIt‚Äôs not only about my own death ‚Äî what really breaks me is the thought of losing my girlfriend.  \nEven writing this makes me anxious. We‚Äôre both young and healthy, and we have our whole lives ahead of us, but still, I‚Äôm scared.\n\nSometimes I get horrible, intrusive images ‚Äî like trying to talk to her and she doesn‚Äôt respond, or realizing she‚Äôs gone forever.  \nIt feels unbearable.

That‚Äôs terrifying.\n\nI honestly don‚Äôt understand how other people just go through life without being crushed by this.  \nIt‚Äôs eating away at me.  \nI haven‚Äôt really talked to my girlfriend about it ‚Äî I don‚Äôt want to burden her, and I know she couldn‚Äôt really help me with it anyway.",

      "selftext": "Hello, this is not my first post,\nbut I‚Äôm here crying so hard because of my thoughts.\nI haven‚Äôt been diagnosed with anything, and I‚Äôve never been to a therapist, because where I live there are no therapists available.\n\nI‚Äôll tell my experience and try to summarize.\n\nFirst,\nA year and four months ago, I got married to the man I love, and I was extremely happy.\nThen suddenly, after a few days, I felt the world around me become strange.\nI didn‚Äôt understand why everything was going the way it was  why we act like this, why things happen this way.\nEvery thought turned into a question.\n\nThen suddenly a thought came to me that nothing is real.\nI tried to get rid of it in every possible way, but I couldn‚Äôt.\nI searched on Google and found out about Depersonalization Disorder, and I didn‚Äôt know anything about it before.\nI felt reassured that my thoughts were known and familiar.\n\nThen suddenly, the thought changed\nthat I‚Äôm living in a dream, or that I created everything, or that I‚Äôm God, or that everything happens only inside my mind.\nAll these patterns of thinking tortured me, and I used to spend days trying to prove to myself the opposite just to feel some relief.\nWhenever I got rid of one thought, another would come,\nand of course, these were thoughts that felt unique to me not written anywhere, not found in others‚Äô stories.\n\nMy mind was torturing me with the idea that these thoughts are true,\nand at the same time, I wanted to prove they weren‚Äôt, so I could rest.\nAll the existential thoughts were tormenting me.\n\nSecond,\nI lost everything all at once when these thoughts entered my life.\nI no longer cared, enjoyed, or loved doing anything I used to love.\nWhenever I tried to do anything, I immediately felt like my old life was open in front of me,\nand I could see the difference\nhow now I live a miserable life because of these thoughts,\nand how I will never return to who I was.\n\nWhenever I think about anything,\nmy mind immediately says: ‚ÄúDo you remember when you didn‚Äôt have these thoughts? How happy and comfortable you were? You‚Äôll never go back to that again.‚Äù\nI remember that old feeling right away  the comfort I had before.\nI wake up every day carrying the burden of these thoughts, wishing they would just disappear.\n\nI think about them all day long,\nto the point that if I talk to someone or think about anything else,\nI feel like I‚Äôm lying because my whole concern now is these thoughts and how to get rid of them.\nI don‚Äôt think about anything else.\nAt the same time, I feel guilt and regret that I can‚Äôt let go,\nand my mind keeps showing me that I‚Äôve ignored my life and all the good in it,\nyet it won‚Äôt let go of the thoughts either.\n\nI don‚Äôt want to make this too long, but\nhas anyone gone through something like this?\nAnd what was your diagnosis in the end?\n\nThird,\nWhenever I find reassurance,\nmy mind immediately turns it into torment.\nIt says: ‚ÄúYour mind created this reassurance.\nYour mind allowed the people who comfort you to exist. None of this is real.‚Äù\n\nFourth,\nI started questioning my feelings and thoughts all day long \nwhether they‚Äôre real or not,\nand whether my actions are right or wrong.\nIs there a specific way I‚Äôm supposed to think, feel, or behave?\n\nI feel like everything I feel, think, or do is wrong.\nAt the same time, I miss my old life \nwhen I could feel and think without asking whether it was right or not.\n\nI started wanting to make sure of every feeling and thought I have about people around me \nas if I need permission to think or feel certain things.\nI started to feel that I‚Äôm only allowed to think and feel the things that other people think and feel.\n\nFifth,\nI feel like if I have a disorder,\nthen I‚Äôm just blaming my mistakes on it \nthat these are my thoughts and I deserve to suffer from them forever.\nAnd because of the existential thoughts,\nI feel like I created the idea that maybe I have a disorder with treatment and recovery \njust so I could feel better \nbut actually, nothing exists, and all of this had to happen as part of the story I‚Äôm living.\n\nEven after I write and post something and feel a little relief,\nmy mind doesn‚Äôt accept it.\nIt tells me: ‚ÄúNo, you can‚Äôt just post something, feel relief, and have everything solved so easily.‚Äù\n\nIt feels like someone inside my head is against me \ngiving me everything and its opposite.\nAll I know is that it doesn‚Äôt want me to be comfortable or happy for even a moment.\n\nWhenever I feel a new symptom and search for it and don‚Äôt find anyone else describing it,\nI swear my mind makes me suffer more \nas if it wants me to think about it endlessly and feel I must suffer.\nI hate my mind.\n\nWhy can‚Äôt my mind believe that these are just thoughts?\n\nThe latest thought that tortures me is:\nthat I am God, the one who created the universe and allowed humans to do everything they do \neven things against my will \nthat every reply here happens only with my permission,\nand that I chose to live as a normal human being.\n\nI feel tortured every single day.\nMy family talks about God and how He glorifies Himself through their lives,\nwhile in my mind these filthy thoughts are the opposite of everything I hear and try to live by.\nWhy won‚Äôt they leave me alone?\n\nEighth,\nEven when I‚Äôm not having existential thoughts \nfor example, if I just feel that my thoughts are wrong \nwhen I find someone thinking like me,\nmy mind immediately says, ‚ÄúYou created that person who thinks like you.‚Äù\n\nI feel like these existential thoughts mix with other thoughts just to make me suffer more.\n\nEven when I spend good time with my husband,\nI feel like I‚Äôm the only one enjoying it \nthat he‚Äôs not happy or doesn‚Äôt feel the same comfort I do.\nEverything turns into a question and a kind of torture literally\n\nSometimes I feel like I‚Äôve completely lost the solid ground I used to stand on. The existential thoughts took away the very foundation that once held me together. I don‚Äôt even know how to express my suffering anymore‚Äîbecause I feel like I‚Äôm the cause of it.\n\nI can‚Äôt even talk to my friends or my husband about it; it feels like they aren‚Äôt real, like they don‚Äôt have any awareness without me.\n\nSorry for the long post,\nbut I‚Äôm here crying and crying,\nand I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm suffering from.\n",

      "selftext": "Some context: 20 y/o with IBS-D since I was about 16, that has definitely improved with medication (amitriptyline) but the general anxiety is still there? Anxiety stems from bad experiences with IBS and lack of restrooms in general, especially when commuting, traveling, or literally being anywhere there might not be access to a bathroom quick. Use to feel oncoming panic attacks especially when waiting for something (e.g. metro, bus stop, in bus, on metro in between stops, commuter trains with no toilet, even in classrooms when it's not easy to slip out). Thanks to the medication (been on it for 4 months approx) my stomach has almost completely calmed down, and whenever I feel that anxiety attack coming on, I only feel it in my chest, face and not in my stomach! (Thank god! sorta). \n\nAnyways, this change in making me feel *slightly* comfortable outside feels like it just pushed up my motivation a lot! Yet, I still feel just... unable. I've realized that my anxiety has kept me from properly making friends, joining university clubs, and just even attending class! I spent a year abroad in one of the most popular cities in the world and spent the entire time in my dorm (except for when I went to classes because attendance was mandatory). My grades aren't looking good, BUT I have been making the effort to improve them because I realized how important they are if I want a good job after graduating or get into grad school. With one year left until graduation I've been applying to get into school clubs to boost my CV (with no luck because it's the middle of the semester lol), and I realized that I ~~might~~ need to get an internship so at least my experience is better than my not so good grades, but *still* I feel stuck. Internship applications are due so soon, but if I were to get it, then what's next? I've spent so much time in school but what's going to actually be useful?\n\nI feel so much motivation yet getting out of the house feels so hard. I live in the suburbs and getting into the city is at least 20 minutes, 40 to campus (could be worse so I am quite thankful). I have an appointment with a new psychologist this week so hopefully I can sort things out. I'm a little worried because where I live they can be strict when it comes to medication, and take their sweet time when scheduling appointments. I don't want to wait more for the possibility to get better. I still feel so motivated and so capable of doing things yet not? Is this motivation just going to plummet when we reach the colder winter months? \n\n  \nTLDR: Anxiety because of IBS-D, which has calmed down with medication. Because my stomach is better I do feel more motivated and want to get to doing things that my ibs prevented me of doing for so many years, but I still feel so stuck and scared of taking those steps.",

I‚Äôve heard this happens to other people too ‚Äî like that hangxiety feeling ‚Äî but for me it goes deeper.\n\nFive years ago, I was robbed in Madrid by three guys with knives who forced me to withdraw money from an ATM. The money wasn‚Äôt the main issue, but the trauma really stuck with me. Since then, whenever I‚Äôm hungover, my anxiety skyrockets. I start getting irrational fears ‚Äî like being alone at home makes me feel unsafe, scared that something bad might happen or that someone might break in.\n\nI‚Äôm already doing therapy and next Thursday I‚Äôll be starting EMDR, which I‚Äôm hopeful about. But honestly, I‚Äôm just wondering ‚Äî does this kind of anxiety ever go away? Has anyone gone through something similar?\n\nI‚Äôve also noticed I don‚Äôt like going out much anymore, especially at night or when traveling. I used to *love* traveling and being out, but now I often feel tense or uneasy.\n\nI‚Äôm thinking quitting alcohol might be a good idea for my mental health. For those who stopped drinking ‚Äî did it help with your anxiety or PTSD symptoms?

Whenever I prepare well for my viva or exam, I understand everything perfectly while studying ‚Äî but the moment I sit in front of the examiner, my mind just goes completely blank.\n‚Äé\n‚ÄéI forget even the basics I revised just a few hours before. It‚Äôs not like I didn‚Äôt study; I prepare properly, revise, and even try to stay calm. But during the actual viva or exam, it feels like all the information just vanishes.\n‚Äé\n‚ÄéBecause of this, my confidence is dropping. My 3rd semester exams are starting next month, and I also have to clear a 1st semester backlog. I really want to improve my recall and stay calm under pressure.\n‚Äé\n‚ÄéHas anyone here faced this? How did you overcome it?\n‚ÄéAny study techniques, mental exercises, or routines that helped you remember things better during vivas or exams would be really helpful.\n‚Äé\n‚ÄéThanks in advance üôè",

Just last week I started working again which has been exhausting to be honest. It‚Äôs a job I do think I could enjoy, so I‚Äôm trying to stick with it and see. \n\nAll week I haven‚Äôt been able to sleep properly because at night my mind starts racing about all the things that happened that day and all the things I need to do tomorrow. I tell myself I really need to go to sleep soon, otherwise I won‚Äôt get enough sleep (again) and won‚Äôt be able to function at work. I try to think about other things but I will always come back to worrying thoughts and my anxiety is just through the roof. \n\nThe sleep deprivation is also affecting me during the day now and I find it hard to relax. I‚Äôm worried that I‚Äôll never get out of this cycle. \n\nI dim the lights hours before bed, try to avoid blue light, I‚Äôll have sleepy tea, take melatonin (sometimes), do breathing exercises, read before bed (sometimes) but none of it seems to work. \n\nI want to take the pressure off, but also prioritize sleep. I don‚Äôt know how to do both because I just start thinking about how I really need to sleep, and then my mind starts racing. No matter how tired I am, my thoughts never stop and it‚Äôs causing me so much anxiety. \n\nAt my last day of the week I even cried to my boss when he asked how I‚Äôm doing which is SO embarrassing. I understand that it‚Äôs logical for me to feel this way and that I‚Äôll feel stronger and less anxious with enough sleep but I can‚Äôt seem to break the cycle.\n\nI used to take quetiapine for sleep but it wasn‚Äôt meant as ‚Äòforever medication‚Äô so I quit (which was hard). When I used to be really anxious about the next day though, or had a lot on my mind, it didn‚Äôt always help me sleep and I‚Äôd just feel groggy and emotional the next day. Which worsened my anxiety. It makes me feel like a zombie too for a few hours after waking, which is not ideal for my type of work.\n\nMy psychiatrist at the time did consider anxiety meds once, but due to my physical condition (or something, i‚Äôm not sure anymore) it was a no. I also can‚Äôt have benzodiazepines because I got addicted to xanax once‚Ä¶\n\nI‚Äôm not in therapy right now so I‚Äôm looking for support on here. I‚Äôll appreciate any tips or tricks, or a little chat. \n\nThank you <3\n",

When I tell you, I have tried everything because unless this happens to you too it is one of the worst feelings to go through and I don‚Äôt think I have ever woke up and not had to deal with it. I am diagnosed with SAD and GAD but I would like to treat the actual problem instead of just taking a benzo as soon as I wake up. I have a heard time as well holding eye contact and if I ever have to public speak I will start vomiting and shaking. It took me having to take a benzo to even be able to tell a doctor what was wrong with me because I have panic attacks going to the doctor lol I cannot win. It worked though doing so because the day I did that and finally went to see one was the day I was put on Prozac and Xanax (1 mg twice a day) \nI also started working out 5 days a week and eat healthy(ish) 4 years ago just to prove to doctors it has nothing to do with my lifestyle.

I didn't understand why and it made me panic a little bit more but after an hour or so I was able to calm down a little bit. The next day I woke up thinking that my symptoms were gone but they weren't. Instead, my arm was feeling heavy, numb, tingly, and it made me worry about a heart attack. That's been my worry for the last days, especially after experiencing some chest pains (really subtle), but today, it feels worse. My left arm feels heavy, numb, the whole top of my left hand is numb and if I try to touch it it feels weird, like it isn't there. I can move my hand and arm around, use it, but i have this weird numbness that doesn't seem to go away. what is this. is this anxiety? how can i bear with it?",

And others range between 4.0-6.9 and I have been getting a lot of anxiety when it comes to these earthquakes and whenever I see a new headline in social media that there's another earthquake that occurred. I haven't felt an earthquake yet and that's what I'm worried and scared of. I've been having breakdowns for the past few days and I can't seem to control my anxiety about it. I know that the Philippines is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire. That fact doesn't make it any better honestly. I've been super anxious lately to the point that it had even eating me up. I can't stop thinking about evey second that an earthquake would happen. I live near the fault line called \"The Big One\" and it makes me so scared and I don't feel safe anymore. I need help, I try to find ways of distracting myself but it just doesn't help and I end up overthinking... please give me advice...",

      "selftext": "Not sure how long this post will be because well im in the middle of dealing with anxiety and who knows what thoughts/rabbit holes it will open up‚Ä¶.\n\nI am in college in my 5th year‚Ä¶. Life has been pretty good last couple years but I have a history with anxiety. I could say theres the genetic component with my mom having been on ssri and dealing with it, to my dad while never admitting to it, he has obvious symptoms on an outsider perspective (which is funny because i know in the midst of anxiety others often cant tell) but hes my dad and as an alcoholic i think he ‚Äúself medicates‚Äù and ive known him for my 23 years on earth so i can just tell though he would never admit it. My sister also has anxiety with one instance of long lasting anxiety‚Ä¶ however i could tell you know i sorta have it the worst outta all of em. \n\nAs a child i was put in counseling and speech therapy because i refused to eat, because i had a deep fear that I was going to choke‚Ä¶ turns out it wasnt a physical issue (go figure) but i was young 7 or 8. So anxiety wasnt a word i could associate with what i was going through. I then had it again  minorly at about 10-11. Lets fast forward to the next real big instance. Junior year of high school me and my friends got our ears pierced, all of the sudden I found myself awake panicking about how my ear would get infected, id get sepsis and die. Just a complete rabbit hole of thoughts with a spin out. I felt out of control. I was awake for two days with anxiety that was real bad to the point of shaking. I went to my moms house (parents divorced) and I told her i had anxiety and i knew the feeling of anxiety at this point but not like this. In the years between the fear of choking and then it was a come and go type of thing that never lasted that long. It was at that point my anxiety was so bad i was crying and pleading outside my moms bathroom while she was taking a shower that something was immenently wrong. I felt so out of control i was fearful I would hurt myself. My anxiety then (TW:suicide) was that I was going to harm myself despite the fact i never wanted to take my own life I was worried i was going to come to a point that I would, that I would see it as my only option. So an ER trip later (probably traumatic for my mom because my older half brother on my moms side has bipolar, and i mean the take lithium or hes manic bipolar) but they gave me a dose of xanax and a couple xanax pills to take home + an SSRI prescription. During those months I was realky anxious and depressed and if I look back it really felt like the depression stemmed from being anxious for a day or two so i would then feel depressed because my body had used all its neurotransmitters. Yet in this I struggled with the anxiety thoughts and less of the physical symptoms (still happened but the thoughts were the worst) then I eventually recovered after changing ssri, therapy with breathing techniques and I sort of felt fed up with always analyzing how i felt in every single moment. It felt like i just got over evaluating every emotion i had so i stopped worrying abt my mental state and started living in the moment. So yay im fixed ‚Ä¶.\n\n\n\nBut my freshman year of college it came back just as bad after a sort of 1.5 year remission. I moved out of state for college to hawaii. A whole 3000 miles away which was a big life change. I again dealt with that same type of anxiety where I felt that I would get so depressed i would hurt myself even though my depression wasnt that severe, but the anxiety worsened it. Eventually I got over it with talking to my mom and sort of looking back on what had helped me and what didnt. Now 3.5 years later I am here again with that same level of anxiety‚Ä¶ its only been raally 1.5 weeks since the onset but in hindsight i could see some moments where it was worse than normal in the last two months‚Ä¶ but I havent had those ‚Äúwhat if i hurt myself/out of control moments‚Äù instead I havent been really dealing with air starvation and physical symptoms/feelings. I worry ill regret this but i do feel sort of glad its not as much the mental component but I am so frustrated that i have to deal with this. Like why now (but theres never a ok moment) I am looking to really commit myself to breathing techniques and all the things that help people with anxiety generically. I know that this will pass but it might be months as it was in the past and i feel sorry frustrated that i could cry but i cant. I do see the low lying depression symptoms but it feels like first it was choking, then fear of suicide, and now it feels like a new thing which‚Ä¶ the suicide thing was so bad im really glad its not that but it feels like a diff beast. I took ssri the last two big episodes so going to see if i can get by with coping skills for now but am not ashamed if i need med help again‚Ä¶. But just curious if anyone has similiar story, or can relate to certain psrts.",

      "selftext": "TW: Recount of panic symptoms. The first paragraph is purely a description of strong physical sensations. If that strikes you as potentially triggering or unnecessary, please read with discretion.   \n  \nI went to a public swimming pool today with my mother. I had a feeling beforehand that this was probably overexposure, but she negotiated with me and thought that it'd be helpful -- well-meaning, of course. \n\nAnyhow, as soon as we stepped into the foyer, I heard loud gym music blaring and saw many people idling around the service desk. I immediately felt the adrenaline surge, which made me think about panicking, in turn triggering more adrenaline and more panic. At this stage, I wanted to flee, but I just followed behind my mother as we headed out to the pool. As we walked into the hot open air, the various pools surrounding us, countless people dotted the yard, talking amongst each other, while I clenched my fist as hard as I could and looked down at the ground, avoiding the urge to sit down and recover. Eventually, after getting to where she'd swim, I sat on a bench, watched her go in the light blue Olympic-size pool, and declined to join. Surprisingly, I was fine for a while as I watched her drift up and down the length of the pool, able for a second to admire the bright colors and to appreciate the activity of the scene. However, when I began to think about her climbing onto the ledge to get out, beckoning me to leave, I felt it coming back again. I pictured how far I'd have to walk, the masses of people I'd have to pass by, the searing heat, and the distance of the car from where we were. By the time she was in front of me, then, I'd already been feeling a significant wave of adrenaline, and I felt desperate, unable to voice my wish to cut out the obstacles and just lay down for a moment. It was torturous, walking back through where we'd came, fearing that I was going to lose control while also knowing that I needed to remain composed -- until the car, which was a way away, under the heat of the sun. \n\n  \nAfter we came home, my mother suggested that it was important for me to confront my feelings head-on. I didn't know how to communicate to her what I'd felt, much less the urgency with which I felt I needed to seek out someone else's guidance. She's always been the type of person who advises a \"home\" solution before a medical one, having never experienced my symptoms before and growing up in conditions where she had to be rugged and independent. As such, she says I should do more exercise and take some vitamins. I don't blame her, and I know that she's trying to help me in a way that feels relevant to her experiences of stress. But I'm also aware that what works for her does not seem to help me. If anyone would like to share a similar experience, offer some advice for my situation, or help me reframe what happened today, I'd be appreciative. \n\n  \n",

I‚Äôm never sure if I‚Äôm having a heart attack or not until I actually calm down.\n\nI wonder if it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm too overstimulated before I go to bed but I‚Äôm not for sure. Does anyone have any advice for how to reduce nocturnal panic attacks or to remain calm after having one? Does anyone else have experiences with nocturnal panic attacks like this? I would really appreciate any advice or shared experiences. I‚Äôm the only one I know that has this problem and I feel like me/my brain just don‚Äôt work right sometimes. ",

It‚Äôs really hard to take a deep breath in at this minute and it‚Äôs been constant since last night, whereas usually it comes and goes over the years and quite rare that I get it. \n\nI did read that anxiety can manifest in different ways even if you‚Äôre not worried, so I can only put it down to this. I haven‚Äôt been very stressed at work the last 2 weeks, and I feel this is why I have a stiff neck and tense shoulders/upper back at the minute, so I‚Äôm not sure if the breathing is related to that too maybe. I did start elvanse for my ADHD in September which has been amazing, I did get a tiny bit of anxiety at first but nothing crazy.\n\nI just wondered if anyone knew how to get rid of this horrible breathless feeling, as it‚Äôs constant right now and doing my head in! \n\nI went to my doctor about it years ago, however she didn‚Äôt really know what I was talking about lol!",

      "selftext": "There was a time when my days felt like they were ruled by fear. My heart would race for no clear reason. Palpitations made me think something was deeply wrong. Nights were the hardest ‚Äî I would lie awake, anxious about whether I‚Äôd sleep, and that very worry would keep me awake.\n\nI thought I was broken. I thought I would never feel calm again. But little by little, I discovered that anxiety wasn‚Äôt something to be defeated ‚Äî it was something to understand. It was my body‚Äôs way of saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm scared. Please take care of me.‚Äù\n\nThe turning point came when I stopped fighting my feelings. Instead of asking, ‚ÄúHow do I make this go away?‚Äù I gently told myself:\n\t‚Ä¢\t‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay to feel anxious.‚Äù\n\t‚Ä¢\t‚ÄúI am safe right now.‚Äù\n\t‚Ä¢\t‚ÄúMay I be well. May I be peaceful.‚Äù\n\nAt first, I still needed help ‚Äî small doses of medication, or little practices to settle my body. And that‚Äôs okay. Healing is not a sign of weakness; it‚Äôs a sign of care. Over time, I practiced simple things like walking slowly and noticing each step, breathing gently, and offering kindness to myself even when I felt uncomfortable.\n\nI also learned not to chase sleep. Sleep comes when the body feels safe. So instead of forcing it, I created the conditions for rest ‚Äî dim lights, a cool room, a calm mind ‚Äî and reminded myself that even if I didn‚Äôt sleep perfectly, I was still healing.\n\nThe most powerful lesson was this: peace is not the absence of anxiety ‚Äî it‚Äôs the ability to stay kind and steady even while anxiety is present. And when I practiced that, the anxious thoughts and feelings gradually lost their grip.\n\nToday, I still have moments of worry. But I know now they don‚Äôt define me. I know they pass. And I know I have the strength to meet them with patience, compassion, and trust.\n\nTo anyone walking this same path: you are not alone. You are not broken. You are already healing ‚Äî even if it doesn‚Äôt feel like it yet. Be gentle with yourself. Care for yourself the way you would care for someone you love. One day, you will look back and realize you‚Äôve come much further than you ever imagined.\n\nüåø May you be well. May you be peaceful. May you know that calm is already growing within you.",

      "selftext": "For context, I've had anxiety attacks before but never randomly from me being asleep. Recently, I have had two very odd experiences of waking up in the middle of the night. For background, the first time I was hungover and took these sleep gummies with 2mg of THC. I take them often and have not had any problems. I had been a sleep for a couple hours and suddenly woke up from my sleep with my heart pounding out of my chest. I was shaking so much it felt like my body was vibrating. I got up and went to the bathroom and turned on my lights still shaking like crazy. I was convinced that the gummies were making me lose my vision and that in a few moments I'd be blind. The weirdest thing is that I was fully awake so I dont know why I thought that. I splashed water on my face and then held onto the walls (again, I think I'm going blind) as I went back into my room to try to fall asleep again. Then I had a moment of realization where I was like WTF am I thinking, that's not possible. It was like the rational part of my brain popped back in. Then a couple days ago, the same thing happened. I was not hungover and had taken nothing to go to sleep. I wake up vibrating and heart pounding again thinking that my brother had decorated my room with Christmas lights. I was fully awake, even checked my phone. My room was pitch black yet I could see Christmas lights. So I went to the bathroom again and had another moment of realization. Obviously he did not come into my room in the middle of the night and put Christmas lights in?? I have no idea what the hell happened here or if I'm posting in the right forum. The reason I'm concerned is because it was the worst feeling ever. I have never felt such visceral terror and would like it to not happen again. ",

But anyways...\n\nThe hardest time for me is like the first hour or two of me waking up. My anxiety is at 1000% every single time. It's so much stronger than usual. To the point where I've made a rule for myself to not make decisions during this time. If I decide to do anything during that time, it'll be me basically not taking any opportunities or not taking care of shit that needs to be taken care of.\n\nThe issue is sometimes I feel like it taints my whole day. If I let myself dwell on that feeling too much when I wake up then my whole day feels wayyyy harder. Or I get on reddit or whatever social media and it just amplifies any feelings I have in a negative way (working on not doing that during my mornings too). It's just so frustrating since by the time I'm about to fall asleep at night I think I'm the least anxious version of myself, but once I wake up it's overflowing again.\n\nAnyone else who feels the intense morning anxieties, is there anything you do that helps you manage it all better?",

It feels like time has flown by, like only yesterday I was 20. But that‚Äôs not the case anymore, and I still can‚Äôt accept that I‚Äôm 30.\n\nI feel completely lost. After graduating from college two years ago, I haven‚Äôt been able to find a job that I like or that pays well. Every job I‚Äôve gotten has been entry-level. I guess I chose the wrong degree, which was biochemistry. \n\nAt first, I wanted to be a scientist. I wanted to find the cure for cancer and extend human lifespan. I‚Äôve been obsessed with lifespan extension for about five years now, and I think I know why: because I want to save my parents from dying. I don‚Äôt want them to die.\n\nThe worst part is that I‚Äôve been living far from them for the past five years. I couldn‚Äôt move back home after graduation, and I couldn‚Äôt find a job near them. Now my mother has been having some health issues that no one in my family seems to fully understand, and it‚Äôs worrying me a lot. For the first time, I‚Äôm really starting to think that my parents might not be around forever... and I haven‚Äôt achieved anything yet. Nothing they could be truly proud of.\n\nWhen I was 18, I had big plans. I graduated first in my high school class with perfect grades, got into an engineering program after passing the admission exam, and thought I‚Äôd have a bright future. Then everything went downhill. I lost motivation, got depressed, got bad grades, and dropped out. Then I started over, dropped out again, started over again, and finally got a degree in biochemistry two years ago. But for what? My GPA wasn‚Äôt great, so med school or even PA school are out of reach.\n\nI thought about pursuing a PhD to become a scientist, maybe even discover ways to extend life, but that would mean being away from my parents for another 5‚Äì6 years. I‚Äôd finish around 36, maybe too late to ‚Äúsave‚Äù them. That thought scares me to death.\n\nI wanted them to have a good life, to travel the world, retire comfortably by the ocean, enjoy grandchildren, and see their kids settled with good jobs, loving partners, and happy families. I‚Äôm terrified they‚Äôll die before they see any of that. What a disappointment I must be!\n\nWhy hasn‚Äôt anyone invented a time machine so I could go back to 2012 and fix everything? God, I swear I‚Äôd do everything right this time. I‚Äôd even start believing in God if that wish came true!\n\nIs anyone else in a similar situation? Undecided between wanting to move back in with your parents in your 30s, or follow your dreams that you‚Äôre not even sure you still believe in? Because that‚Äôs me, fellas. I don‚Äôt even know if I should start a PhD, do a master‚Äôs, or give up on science completely and focus on writing or music instead. I‚Äôm broke, depressed, sad, and terrified about my aging parents.",

I‚Äôve been suffering with driving anxiety and panic attacks for a handful of years now.\nI just turned 30 years old and it has progressed to the point where I barely leave my house, unless I‚Äôm riding passenger with my fianc√©. I hate driving, I hate being in the car and I truly fantasize a reality where I could exist in society without the need to drive at all. Being that I don‚Äôt live in a metro area (and have no plans to), this really isn‚Äôt the case. I used to love to drive, and did it pretty fearlessly up until some traumatic events that happened in my 20‚Äôs that soared my anxiety into overdrive. Now, when I drive- i get such intense physical anxiety I feel the need to pull over almost immediately, feeling as if I am going to faint. My heart races, palms sweat, and vision goes distorted. I fear that I am not safe to drive in this state, which in turn makes my anxiety worse. Even the thought of driving a far distance makes me feel sick to my stomach. I am currently on anxiety medication that does make me feel more stable, but it hasn‚Äôt helped with the driving portion of my life. This anxiety has almost turned into a full on phobia. Is there anything I can do to shake this? I have tried hypnotherapy, traditional therapy, medication, meditation- it feels like I‚Äôve tried everything.  \n\n Some backstory that may be helpful to know that a couple of these ‚Äúevents‚Äù did include vehicles. A close relative suffered a traumatic brain injury within 2 years of my close friend going missing. I was T-boned by a drunk driver while out searching for him. Nobody was injured in that accident, but I did have an increase in my driving anxiety in general during that time. I believe my body is holding onto trauma from those times and it‚Äôs coming up when I get in the car. \n\nI‚Äôm desperate for help. I just want to have the freedom of existing and feeling like a functional adult again. we want kids in our near future, and although my fianc√© is supportive, we both want me to feel confident to safely drive them when that time comes. \n\nPlease tell me someone out there has overcome this.

I keep getting told from people it will be fine, no need to worry but we'll anxiety plus experience.\n\nMy last house, my neighbour was awful about the fence. We had to get the local council involved, our fencer nearly walked off the job because she was being such a cow to him and then she reporting us to council and police for our dog attacking her (the dog that had died 6 months prior and she obviously didnt realise) but at least then I had my Dad. He was good at having those types of conversations and keeping his cool, I am not and Im so worried about talking to them.\n\nThey might be nice, we might be on the same page. They also might not give a shit that my dog caught herself on one of the nails and they might get out if the fence falls anymore.\nThey also might be complete assholes like the last neighbour was.\n\nNone of this anxiety is being helped by the fact it has been an awful year with just one thing after another. Dogs had ear infections, aural hematoma, I went in the er and had to get my gallbladder out, changing medications, dog ripped his dew claw, stove broke, toilet broke, dog grew a weird angry lump on his face and needed it removed, other dogs weird skin around their mouth came back, washing machine broke, now a fence and with nothing going my way this year I'm just worried this will be another thing to break me.\n\nI know I need to put my big girl pants on and do it but I'm just terrified and no idea how to do it like do I know on their door, do I try to catch them outdoors, do I put a letter in their mailbox?\n\nI hate anxiety so much right now.\n\nNot sure what's worse my anxiety of having to talk the neighbours, talking to the tradies or the fear of leaving the house and having my dogs get out, get hurt or both.\n",

      "title": "Unexplained dizziness",
      "selftext": "I've dealt with constant anxiety my entire life and I've gotten used to feeling miserable all the time. This however, is a new type of miserable. I wear contacts and I usually put eye drops into my eyes after putting in the contacts. I couldn't find my regular bottle of eye drops so I used another bottle I had lying around. I only put the drops in my right eye. I started driving to work and noticed my vision was going in and out, looking around at things started to get blurry, light sensitivity, and just a general uncomfortable feeling. I managed to make it to work and noticed that my right eye was dilated. I started to panic and thought I was having a heart attack or that something was seriously wrong. I went into work and asked my co-workers if they noticed a difference between my eyes, and they did. I panicked more because of that. They suggested taking my contacts out because maybe my contacts weren't sitting properly. So, I took my contacts out and sat in the bathroom for a few minutes hoping everything would go away. Well, I have a -6.00 prescription so I was ultimately blind while experiencing all of these physical symptoms. Long story short, EMS came to my work and they said everything was fine. They tested my glucose levels and my blood pressure and said it was a little high but nothing to be concerned about. My husband brought my glasses into work and the EMS team told him he couldn't give them to me (so I've essentially been blind this entire time). I ended up having my husband drive me to the ER. The doctor there looked up the ingredients in the eye drops I used and said there was a side effect of eye dilation occurring. So, I figured that's all it was. The dizziness and uncomfortable physical symptoms went away and I went on with my life. \n\nOne month later, I was at a work meeting and started to feel uncomfortable. I felt my vision going in and out, feelings of needing to faint, and a tingling sensation in my hands in feet. I went to the bathroom hoping I could sit through it and make whatever the feeling was go away. It did not. I ended up throwing up from being so dizzy and I had my husband pick me up from the work meeting. \n\nThings basically went downhill after that. I was out of work for two months and experienced dizziness every single day. Somedays were so bad that I couldn't even get out of bed because the room was spinning. This feeling was accompanied by tingling in my hands and feet, the feeling of fainting, sensitivity to light, light distortions (if I look at something bright, I continued to see it repeat itself even with my eyes closed), an \"out of body feeling\", brain fatigue, and just general fatigue. I wasn't able to drive and I felt like I was living in fear. I had numerous visits with my primary doctor and urgent care doctors. They assumed the dizziness was caused by vertigo so I had a consultation with a physical therapist that specialized in vertigo. She didn't notice anything out of the ordinary with my tests. I went to a cardiologist and had a full workup done including an echo of my heart. Again, they noticed nothing out of the ordinary. I went to a ENT and he used a microscope in my inner ear to see if anything was wrong there. I also did a hearing test and they said everything was normal. I was told to start taking fish oil pills, magnesium gluconate, riboflavin, and COQ10 (I've been taking these for 2 months now). The ENT also recommended taking Dramamine occasionally if the flare-ups were bad enough and doing a nasal salt rinse once a day. Still nothing. I went to a neurologist and they did a balance test on me and those results also came back normal..\n\nIt's been about three months now and the dizziness has gotten better but things in my life still aren't the same. I now see a therapist and I've been practicing meditation to see if it's an anxiety related issue. I have my good days and bad days. It's very frustrating because I still don't feel comfortable enough to drive and I get that \"fainting feeling\" when I'm doing basic things like being at the grocery store or going to work. I'm not really sure what my next step is but I figured I'd share my story. I worry about my future. I worry I won't be able to keep a job and I won't be able to leave my home. My husband has been incredibly supportive during this entire process and I just want things to back to normal. I have this constant fear that I'm going to experience anything \"attack\" like I did with the eyedrops. Or a fear that something is wrong but nobody knows what it is. ",

I never really had serious anxiety before then. I am 19 years old now about to turn 20 and I have no serious anxiety at all without taking any medication. The past year and some months I was taking Xanax 1mg which helped for the most part for my anxiety and attacks. But the thing with it is it makes you feel like a zombie and stuck. And causes dementia if you use it long term. Bunch of side effects to only help one thing. When the answer is finding out what you want in life and working toward and reaching goals you have. If you have no goals set short term goals and long term. I worked easy jobs making minimum wage and a little over for 2 years thinking I would be fine. Because I was comfortable working there because it was easy and I was getting paid. But the truth is I wasn‚Äôt comfortable with where I was at in life and all of my anxiety rooted from the thought that I would never be successful. I wasn‚Äôt doing anything to work towards that. 2 months ago I applied for a job doing something that I have always had an interest in since a kid. I got the job making over triple what I was before and doing something I love. During the training I still had some anxiety not as much I might have just been nervous. But when I completed the training and after the first day on the job i really got to know what I would be doing everyday. After the first day I had no anxiety at all 0 none. Which is something I hadn‚Äôt felt in a long time. I could never figure out the root of my anxiety but it was being unsuccessful and a failure to myself not reaching my goals I‚Äôve set my whole life. First thing I did was call my doctor and tell her I don‚Äôt need Xanax anymore. And started on adhd meds to help me focus on my work. I‚Äôve started working out eating and sleeping better taking care of myself and working full time and I have never felt better. With all that being said if you are struggling with anxiety and you don‚Äôt know the cause of it really think hard about it. Not too hard but set aside time every day to really look into yourself and figure out what is making you anxious. You may be like me and realize it‚Äôs because you know your not giving life your all just sitting comfortably not making any progress. Living paycheck to paycheck. Life is too short to not make the best of it and move up in life while doing something you enjoy that brings true happiness and rids unbearable anxiety. Set goals and work at your all to reach them!",

      "selftext": "Hello anyone out there who can help. I recently got off sertaline 6 months of use about a month ago from 100mg to 50mg for a week to a 50mg every other day for a week to done per my doctor's orders. Kinda felt like that was quick but I did what he said. I felt great the first 2 weeks off of it, I wasnt fatigued, my body didnt feel like it was burning up, things were good and my anxiety was gone. But at about week 3 I was getting wild vivid dreams, I felt like crying for no reason, I felt like a pin dropping while I tried to concentrate on something would send me into a rage. The crying and rage feelings have passed but through week 4 and 5 I felt like I was getting sick, full body aches, a weird tension all over like my muscles were tight, pretty much a tension headache but all over my body. My feet started to burn my hands as well, joint pain all over even in every joint in my toes and fingers, to random cold/hot feelings all over. I still have it today and sometimes it gets really bad. Even parts of my body just feel a weird painful sensation, almost like a cramp but without the actual physical muscle contraction. But enough on that, im wondering has anyone else had this, and that long after stopping. My doc says its withdrawals as of last week, but he also told me the taper would stop that and the withdrawals would subside and start in the first week. So honestly I dont trust him. Just looking for answers from real people who have had real experiences. Because now im being told from him it could last 6 months. Just getting tired of feeling like shit everyday. If anyone out there has answers, hope, or even stuff to help combat this I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you",

I was on antibiotics for it about a month ago, and I thought that the infection was gone if I had one, but now I'm terrified that I'm going to die and that my nausea is caused by my tooth pain and that I'm getting sepsis and that something really bad is happening. I can't go to urgent care until tomorrow since it's so late at night, and I'm so scared I'm gonna get sepsis. I feel kind of weird, like I'm not entirely there, and I've been pacing around my house for the past 20 minutes in order to make sure I'm still thinking clearly. It may sound weird, but I kind of want to be as anxious as possible right now to prove that I'm still aware and conscious. I'm not in any pain or feeling nauseous right now, but I can't stop thinking that the infection is going up to my brain or that I'm getting sepsis and that I'm gonna die.

      "title": "Some Hope For Those Who Need It",
      "selftext": "\nI just wanted to share my anxiety story and hope that it helps anyone in here get through this. \n\nIn 2022, I felt like I‚Äôd been completely normal with no mental health problems. I‚Äôd always heard of these disorders but never really understood them or why people made such a big deal out of it. Until around mid-2023 I developed disordered anxiety. It all started with a burning in my chest that I just couldn‚Äôt shake. I went to my primary, he said it might‚Äôve been GERD (which I do actually have) but when that was treated, it persisted. Along with other symptoms of heart attacks, I was feeling hopeless. I made the decision to go to the ER because I was having my first ever panic attack. Air hunger, sudden feelings of doom, light-headedness, you name it. I went to the ER at least 4 times over anxiety, just for them to tell me I was fine and to go home each time. I did eventually get over the panic attacks and it just turned into health anxiety. Every little thing was the end of the world and honestly I still kinda struggle with this to this day, I just know how to handle it better. I‚Äôve had every symptom that you can think of; back pain, nausea, headaches, muscle aches, fatigue, brain fog, not to mention I was literally dizzy for like a year straight. I had restless legs, a constant feeling of unease, like my stomach couldn‚Äôt settle down. I was bed-ridden for days, calling out of work because of how I felt. It made my GERD 10x worse, too. And yet all of it meant nothing, it was my brain playing tricks on me, trying to tell me I‚Äôm in danger when I‚Äôm not in any whatsoever. The symptoms don‚Äôt stop there, I‚Äôve had them all. Whatever symptom you‚Äôre experiencing that I didn‚Äôt list, I‚Äôve probably had it. \n\nSide note; I recommend getting checked for any new symptoms, I‚Äôm not a doctor telling you to ignore serious symptoms but anxiety does present itself in terrifying and harmless ways. Once you‚Äôre checked and they say you‚Äôre fine, trust them. Do not doubt the doctor‚Äôs ability to diagnose you. But anyway;\n\nIf you want some advice, I would start educating yourself on the topic of anxiety. I did start therapy at one point but never really felt like I was understood. I went through a few of them before finding better luck online. Drew Linsalata is probably the #1 reason I managed to get a grip faster than a lot of others I know with anxiety. He hosts a podcast called The Anxious Truth as well as Disordered, co-hosted by Josh Fletcher. I can‚Äôt thank those gentlemen enough for their contributions to this space. Now, as much as I love them and advocate for them, do not make this your entire life. Don‚Äôt start using it as a crutch for when you‚Äôre feeling anxious. The BEST thing you can possibly do about anxiety, whether it‚Äôs panic attacks or OCD or any other form of it? Nothing. You sit with that panic attack or those restless legs, or the air hunger, the dizziness, the nausea, the headache, the fatigue, ANYTHING. You don‚Äôt have to do this all at once, you‚Äôre not expected to be perfect and do this successfully the first attempt. But with time and dedication to getting over this, you‚Äôll at least start to see the light at the end of this miserable tunnel. I can‚Äôt give you an exact time or speed at which you‚Äôll succeed in overcoming it, because every single person in here is different. Some people take months and for some it takes years. It‚Äôs all dependent on you and how much you trust yourself to make the right decisions. Oh, and stop googling your symptoms; that set me back quite a bit haha. \n\nTo everyone reading this; I love you. You are stronger than you think, you will make it out of this. You‚Äôre more than just your thoughts. Keep fighting the good fight. ‚ô•Ô∏è",

Two birds one stone right? Been on lexy for about 4 years and didnt help with anxiety but did help with the migraines Fast forward to 2 vears ago My anxiety is DEBILITATING I coped by drinking. That led to a whole new world and not areat outcomes. Jump ta now- i Got sober last vear. switched to zoloft and adderall.. I have noticed i am extremely touchy and sensitive and just an angry zombie that feels cloudy and panicky. Edit to add when I was on lexapro and adderall I randomly got a \"great idea\" and spent $700 on 3 ball pythons cause I wanted to breed snakes for a living. I owned two businesses at this time and didnt know shit about snakes but I thouaht I was a professional.

      "selftext": "Hi all. This is my first time posting to this sub. To give yall some background. I‚Äôm in college, I have a boyfriend of 5 years and I love him so much. He graduated and moved across the country and to say the least it was really hard on me at the beginning. Well, when I got back from moving him to his new state, I noticed dots on my feet. I started to freak out and I ended up dealing with it for about 2 months until I was finally referred to a dermatologist who diagnosed me with Lichen Planus. I am hesitant to say it‚Äôs an autoimmune DISORDER because in most people, it clears up and is not a chronic thing, but at the very least it‚Äôs an autoimmune reaction. I‚Äôve never had any health issues in my life and I feel like what really triggered it was the stress of my boyfriend leaving, and then the constant stress about what was happening to my body. Now I‚Äôm in the process of trying to deal with it but it‚Äôs so hard to not feel anxiety about it because I‚Äôm so scared. It has spread obviously since the first initial dot and I‚Äôve seen some improvement using a steroid but I think my stress from thinking about it is unfortunately fueling it. I just don‚Äôt know how to cope and it‚Äôs so frustrating because I need to focus on my schooling but it‚Äôs incredibly difficult. It‚Äôs frustrating and exhausting and I‚Äôm scared and I hate that I feel this way and I wish I was one of those people that would let things ride out but I‚Äôm just not. I‚Äôm on an experimental medication for it, it‚Äôs worked in some people to clear it up but I haven‚Äôt seen any drastic results on the same timeline as others and that‚Äôs just also feeding the anxiety. Anyway I just wanted to rant so maybe I can actually focus a little on something productive now. ",

      "selftext": "Quick note: Sorry for the super long post lol, im not very good at organising my thoughts so this might be a bit hard to follow at times but im trying my best to explain everything in detail.\n\nBelow the main body of the post i will have a section that goes over my symptoms, my medications and whatnot if you dont feel like reading all of this (i dont blame you lol) \n\n23M here, ive had anxiety most of my life. in 2022 i was diagnosed with GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder) and MDD (Major Depressive Disorder) I was seeing a psychiatrist and was put on 25mg of zoloft (later increased to 50 and 100) and Wellbutrin XL 150mg, it first it felt like it made everything worse but i stuck with it and got slightly better than what i was before the medication. I still had my anxiety but i wasnt dwelling on it and letting it ruin me. In mid 2024 I had a physical and when the doctor listened to my heart she said I was having palpitations and have an arrhythmia. I then had a ecg and an echo done which showed that I was having PVCs and PACs but besides that my heart was pretty normal, In late 2024 I stopped taking both my zoloflt and wellbutrin cold turkey (I know it was a dumb move) i kept forgetting to take my medication on some days and i just figured screw it i feel fine i guess i dont need this. For maybe or month or two i had a slight headache and maybe a little lightheadedness but that all subsided and I felt the same. Fast foward to the middle of may this year, i was still feeling alright, but then one day i woke up and it was like BOOM everything was back. I used to get terrible morning anixety (shaking when waking up racing thoughts etc) and it was the first thing i noticed. My anxiety was back in full effect, and for whatever reason i started to really obsess over my heart which ended up making me even more anxious, i still get the PVCs and PACs probably about 1 - 3 times a minute, my heart seems to pound and race from doing literally anything like standing up or taking a shower and sometimes my heart feels like its beating too slow. This was really scaring me. To make matters worse, i lost my insurance earlier this year and have been waiting for enrollment as i do not have the money to start paying for testing and stuff out of pocket,, so not only did i feel like i was dying, i literally had to wait 2 MONTHS to even see a doctor to get testing done and the best part is I STILL DONT HAVE INSURANCE! Open enrollment is soon but if i do end up getting insurance it wont even kick in till the start of next janruary! Yay! . throughout the rest of may, june, july and the beginning of august, i felt horrible, constantly checking my pulse in my neck, shaking and couldnt sit still, panic attacks, trouble sleeping. Finally on the 5th of august i was able to see a doctor and i had an ECG done which showed basically the same results as the last one i had n 2024, i still had PVCs and PACs and irregular heartbeat, the doctor told me that i shouldnt worry as these are very common. She recommended me to go to a cardiologist to have another echo done but visiting a cardiologist is super expensive without insurance and i dont have that kind of money! I was told to start taking my Zoloft and wellbutrin again. So i went home and started taking my Zoloft again (started on 25mg like last time) and i felt even worse! for weeks i had blurred vision, tremors, increased anxiety, couldnt sleep right, muscle and join pain / stiffness back pain, hands and feet randomly would fall asleep or start tingling, headaches every day (not that bad pain wise but annoying) breathing heavy / couldnt get a deep breath, it was awful. After about 4 or 5 weeks i started to feel abit better, and my panic attacks were gone but i still basically felt like crap with most of the symptoms i previously listed still present. I went up to 50 and went through the whole ordeal again. I had some bloodwork done and come to find out i had a vitamin d deficiency, so now im taking 50k units of vitamin d every week for 12 weeks and then ill have to start an over the counter supplement. Im still on the 50 and was still feeling like garbage, still obsessing over my heart and still feeling like im going to die. So about a week ago i went to my psychiatrist for a check in and i was recommended magnesium glycinate supplements, so i went to the store and bought some 240mg tablets, they said to take 2 tablets a day. So starting the next day i took one in the morning and felt really tired by about 8-9pm and fell asleep pretty early before i could even take the 2nd one. The next day i took one in the morning and in the evening and same thing, super tired all day. Now my psychiatrist told me that magnesium glycinate can actually help with some anxiety / stress related symptoms and ive been taking it at night before bed to hopefully help with my sleep but it dosent seem to be doing much. A few days ago i started taking my wellbutrin again and im still on the 50mg zoloft (i decided to wait before upping my dose of zoloft while im getting used to the wellbutrin) and now guess what... I FEEL EVEN WORSE! my shaking / tremors have gotten sooooo bad now and add that on top of all my other symptoms ive been having and yeah... i feel absolutely awful. Im posting this here basically because i dont know what to do, everyone just tells me its anxiety and ill get through it but to be honest im actually scared and can not shake the feeling that im going to die because of my heart or something and im constantly checking my pulse in my neck. \n\nThank you for reading and if you have any suggestions or further questions please feel free to share / ask thank you !\n\n  \nNotes:\n\nIm taking 50mg of zoloft and 150mg of wellbutrin XL every morning (I took 25mg of zoloft for a month before upping to 50, ive been on 50 for a little over a month now and have just started taking my wellbutrin again 2 days ago)\n\nThe main symptoms ive been experiencing every day are body shakes / tremors, muscle and joint stiffness / tightness, cant focus my eyes (blurry vision) lightheaded, keep waking up at night, breathing heavily all the time, headaches, stiff neck, increased anxiety upon waking up, randomly getting chills / goosebumps, sweating randomly. (Alot of these symptoms i had before starting the medications and have been made worse by taking them, only thing that got better was panic attacks)\n\n[](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=dd9fb6dbdd0ac6d1&rlz=1C1ONGR_enUS1148US1148&sxsrf=AE3TifNRtWUixRuQpwXgQU_LoM83EVUIVg:1760137131703&q=deficiency&si=AMgyJEvFC4ZjI6wkOD5UM8o9kmsKrhmRNiVSg6wslrxW_pcCuCLrtA2bZrBDi2MMlKoG588_9arlZCSxG7RVfNxLoIYnF5raQontgwpHTSSsbTM_pVtZQsn2G_x9MzkDnen4ApbbUyNxtYs35r7xpq6qdMoz0MKglQ%3D%3D&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiA1vbj3ZqQAxUMMlkFHcm8CT8QyNoBKAB6BAgUEAA&ictx=1)\n\n[](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=dd9fb6dbdd0ac6d1&rlz=1C1ONGR_enUS1148US1148&sxsrf=AE3TifNRtWUixRuQpwXgQU_LoM83EVUIVg:1760137131703&q=deficiency&si=AMgyJEvFC4ZjI6wkOD5UM8o9kmsKrhmRNiVSg6wslrxW_pcCuCLrtA2bZrBDi2MMlKoG588_9arlZCSxG7RVfNxLoIYnF5raQontgwpHTSSsbTM_pVtZQsn2G_x9MzkDnen4ApbbUyNxtYs35r7xpq6qdMoz0MKglQ%3D%3D&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiA1vbj3ZqQAxUMMlkFHcm8CT8QyNoBKAB6BAgUEAA&ictx=1)\n\n[](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=dd9fb6dbdd0ac6d1&rlz=1C1ONGR_enUS1148US1148&sxsrf=AE3TifNRtWUixRuQpwXgQU_LoM83EVUIVg:1760137131703&q=deficiency&si=AMgyJEvFC4ZjI6wkOD5UM8o9kmsKrhmRNiVSg6wslrxW_pcCuCLrtA2bZrBDi2MMlKoG588_9arlZCSxG7RVfNxLoIYnF5raQontgwpHTSSsbTM_pVtZQsn2G_x9MzkDnen4ApbbUyNxtYs35r7xpq6qdMoz0MKglQ%3D%3D&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiA1vbj3ZqQAxUMMlkFHcm8CT8QyNoBKAB6BAgUEAA&ictx=1)",

But why do i still feel so so much fear. \n\nTo admit. I had been living a chaotic lifestyle and i finally found stability in my home. Able to keep steady relationships. But my mental health is collapsing right before my eyes. \n\nMore of just a rant, everyone‚Äôs anxiety is unique and how they deal with it and solve it. Im just exhausted.

I worry maybe something happened, how late will he be tonight, and since he drives a distance (1.5 hr commute) if he's safe. \n\nThis is a brand new relationship. I don't want to be overbearing in general, but especially not now. \n\nHow can I manage this anxiety I keep having? I'm trying to distract myself but feel almost sick.

I'm also probably somewhere in the autistic spectrum, but not officially diagnosed. I think one of the things that really caracterise me is an obsession with morality, with being a good person. Whenever I believe I have harmed someone or maybe disappointed them I have a meltdown and sink into a heart wrenching sadness. I definitely feel too much, and often I feel others' feelings very intensely. I crave to help, and wish I had control over others' feelings because I want everyone to be okay. \n\nRight now I feel quite rotten. I feel things were better before, when life had not messed me up this much. When I was not so ashamed of being myself, when I was creative and engaged in hobbies. Now I feel like a useless blob, who can barely do anything. I've stopped consuming media, music, books. I feel unauthentic, and I'm so affected by people. What can I do? I want to go back.",

      "title": "I am really feeling anxious because of my friend's behavior.... Need assurance",
      "selftext": "\nHi, \n\nPls read it might get long but I will try to give the whole context in short.\n\nSo basically I have this best friend of mine. I am 23M and she is 22F.\n\nSo recently she had her 4 months on job training for a teaching institute.\n\nI am also working full time. We live far from each other so we can only call or chat. So she has almost done with her training.\n\nNow, at the beginning of her training, she shifted to a different place away from her family. She lived with students from the same institute. It was her first time living like this. She was overwhelmed. So basically she used to connect with me on call, ask for advice, reassurance that this is normal and rants/vents etc etc basically like normal friends do.\n\nNow i understood her situation that things are overwhelming for her and I reply to her texts on the spot. Some days her schedules were so tight that she had to sleep for 2-3 hours thats it. In this training, she has to prepare for tests and demos almost every day on Maths.\nI completely understood that it is very overwhelming and that's the reason I was always there for her at this phase of her life. \n\nI used to ask her if she needs anything financially, or anything to eat, even though she is well to do, just to comfort her. \n\n\nOverall she was doing good in her demos but her tests were not so good, but how much she told me about the institute and management, I told her they won't terminate you since ur teaching skills are good, u just lack knowledge.\n\n\nFast forward to today and she got placed and it's almost complete.\n\n\nNow, what I have noticed is, I understand she is in a very tough phase, new things for her, new stuff to Study, but what eats me is I don't get much acknowledgement to my texts or things which I share. That too is okay, since she was not always like this, but recently it's become a one way thing where I know almost everything about her but she doesn't.\n\n\nSecond thing is, let's say we are having a conversation, on call or chat, she will simply quit the conversation without any reasoning or conclusion message and then randomly come up with a problem or rant after few hours. \n\n\nI am still working on my overthinking and I try to do it less but this personally hurts. I have confronted her about this behavior and she was apologetic multiple times but no change in the behavior.\n\nThe reason I am emphasizing so much on this friendship because she is my school friend, almost 8 years, and I also really have very few people in my life and she is one of them.\n\nI personally feel that even though she was in a very overwhelming, tough situation according to her capacity.......simple updates, conclusion texts, a little acknowledgement on things I share was expected by me. I was not expecting 24x7 calls.\n\ni want to know whether thinking this way is correct or not\n\nI don't expect anything much from her more than this friendship but this behavior really hurts me.\n\nAnd I want to grow as a person so I want to know who is wrong here?\n\nAlso, for more context. She involved me in the beginning of her training a lot, like everyday calls, updates, used to ask me to wake her up, etc etc. But as time passed, she stopped texting much, sometimes making me worried and overthink. I also tried to keep conversations away from her training so that it doesn't always suck but she never wanted to talk properly.\n\nShe got placed yesterday and it's not the place she wanted, but she clearly told me that it's based on performance and she was on the lower side of the performance so she got placed at somewhere she didn't want. But still it was a win because the institute is really good. Now this update she simply sent dry text saying I got placed here, no call, nothing. I also asked her to call when she is free and she again sent a dry text saying \"I am out\".\n\nFor me personally, I was happy that she got placed and it was something to share and be happy about.\n\n\nOnce she texted \"Is never enough in this institute,  I should give my life for this institute\" and it scared the shit out of me. I texted her back to back only to find out after hours that she meant to give 100% of her efforts.\n\n\nI am feeling very anxious recently since we haven't talked the way we used to out of nowhere. 2 days ago I also asked her to call but she replied with a dry text so I didn't bother her much. \n\nThere is no attachment but I am feeling that am I a bad person, I sometimes even literally verbally abuse myself when I am alone out of frustration.\n\n\nI really don't know what did I do wrong for her to behave this way towards me...\n\n",

I couldn't speak, couldn't breathe, and I ended up leaving the room and a colleague had to cover for me. The next day, the exact same thing happened. I think my brain now recognizes public speaking = danger.\n\nI have had anxiety my whole life and have been on and off Lexapro, but don't love some of the side effects. Previously I had tried Propranolol several different times for situational anxiety, and while it calms me down physically, it made me DEATHLY ill with diarrhea.

I still get the rare anxiety attack though. What brings me here is that my heart no longer races when I have them. My whole body feels strange, but not numb (never been able to describe this) and derealization/depersonalization sets in. Then I become a complete hypochondriac. Anyone else have anxiety attacks without their heart racing? I personally think it is because I have learned so much about anxiety and I know I am having an attack, so my heart rate doesn't elevate. At least not drastically. So my anxiety attacks pretty much consist of: weird full body sensation, derealization/depersonalization and fear of impending doom. Anyone else have these symptoms without an elevated heart rate? And forgive me if that was jumble. Currently in the middle one now. I have felt pretty bad this week with some concerning symptoms. Trying to convince myself it is anxiety and not something else. ",

I feel very anxious, I start crying. I feel a lot of stress. I don't like my parents, and I rarely spend time with them. I just want love and acceptance from my parents, but I don't feel it. Maybe I'm too sensitive. But I feel like I shouldn't be around my parents anymore, it's causing me so much pain. Even if they're not doing anything wrong, I'm still so angry with them that I can't control myself, so I'm rude to them even when they don't deserve it. I feel so powerless here. My mom may just ask questions that I find dumb and I already feel so angry. And when I'm here it is hard to me to control myself and I eat way more than I should. When I'm in my dorm in other town I feel better. And also here is my brother who is spending all his time on the computer. And my father is mean to him sometimes. It all feels so wrong. Why do I feel so bad with these people? I think I would feel better if my father wasn't here. He is an awful person sometimes and if I were my mom I would divorce him long ago. He has a problems with alcohol, he cheated on her, he is a bad father, but she still decided to be with him. I guess I still can't accept that my family is so messed up and there's nothing I can do about it",

But that‚Äôs it‚Äôs. The pain still came and went.  I should also mention: the pain episodes started when I also quit using my SSRIs (bc I felt stable and I asked the doc about it) \nAbout 6 weeks at a Wednesday night the pain started to be really bad. I felt brain fog, it didn‚Äôt go away. I had my first real panic attack about it that night. That‚Äôs when everything basically started. I started to think I either have fibromyalgia or ME/CFS. and I no matter what I do this idea stuck in my head. Since then I had severe panic attacks. And my anxiety won‚Äôt go away. My body always feels achy or at least super uncomfortable. I basically feel like I have a mini flu all the time. My doctor started me on SSRIs again and since then the worst of the pain went away. But the anxiety stayed. It‚Äôs so bad that I‚Äôm going inpatient next week. I‚Äôm very grateful that I have the opportunity to do that but I‚Äôm terrified that they won‚Äôt be able to help me there with the physical stuff. I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll be there for eight weeks and they‚Äôll send me away and I have to stay forever like that. And that I do have something else than a mental illness. My life has been on hold since then. I can‚Äôt work. I‚Äôm a burden on my partner and family. \nI should mention that I have a history of depression and mild anxiety. But o never had actual panic attacks before or physical symptoms like that. I feel hopeless and scared and like my life is over. \nIf someone had any advice or encouragement it would be much appreciated. \n\nEdit: the doctor took bloodwork and stuff and didn‚Äôt find anything. Hence she suggested anxiety and SSRIs. Everyone thinks it‚Äôs the anxiety. But I‚Äôm\nNot convinced. \nI don‚Äôt really crash after I do stuff but I do feel exhausted all the time. And I also have like tunnel vision all the time. What confuses me is that even on the rare days when I feel calmer mentally the body still feels achy and uncomfortable and I never goes away. I‚Äôm also confused bc it all started with pain and that‚Äôs why my anxiety started to spiral real bad. Not the other way around. I‚Äôm so devastated.",

      "selftext": "I‚Äôve been on Lexapro (SSRI) for a few years and just added Strattera for my ADHD. I‚Äôve also been taking herbal supplements for at least 6 months to help with the really bad anxiety, insomnia, and hot flashes I‚Äôve been dealing with. These include ashwagandha and saffron. A friend just told me that mixing these supplements with the SSRI could possibly cause serotonin syndrome. FYI, I did tell my doctor I was taking the supplements and he said it was OK. Needless to say, I am no longer taking the supplements. Has anyone ever dealt with this when combining SSRI‚Äôs and certain herbal supplements?",

      "selftext": "Our son was born November 2023 and from what I can remember my anxiety started a few months before he was born.\n\nI had a panic attack last year in February, I was driving the work van on a night shift on my own and all of a sudden my heart started racing, my left arm was hurting and I genuinely thought I was having a heart attack and I thought omg I'm driving alone middle of the night on a motorway (highway for you Americans), how am I going to pull over and call an ambulance.\n\nSince then I've generally been ok but some days I'll go through episodes where my body just feels shit, my chest feels uncomfortable or slightly painful, my left arm has a dull pain and hurts slightly and just generally I feel achy and shit. \n\nOn top of this I've had IBS since around 15, I'm 36 now though my stomach issues have generally been ok and quite mild for a long time now but whenever the anxiety creeps up the stomach also acts up. Since my IBS started I've also had emetophobia along side it and haven't thrown up since 15 years old.\n\nHowever I've just remembered when I was around 16 I had around a week or 2 period where it's the first time I remember having a panic attack/anxiety where I couldn't breath properly and now I know that's called air hunger, it lasted for 2 weeks and I hated the doors at home being closed, one of the days it got particularly bad and my sister called the ambulance, I went to the hospital they ran bloods and X-ray and of course everything was fine.\n\nSo since Septemberish 2023 this anxiety has reared it ugly head again and the symptoms I have either one at a time or a mixture of these is:\n\nHeart palpitations and a feeling of my heart sinking (last for 1 seconds but it's a horrible sensation)\nChest discomfort\nArm pains\nUpset stomach/mild nausea\nAir hunger\nGlobus\nLight headedness, dizzyness, \nVision abit weird (hard to describe)\n\nI've not gone to my doctor yet but I really want to go get tests run for everything to rule out anything hear related.\nI never go to the doctors, thankfully never needed to but I think I should now but how do I explain all this to them? Surely they've come across all these before and Im pretty sure this is anxiety.\n\nIt's also recently occured to me that maybe my IBS has actually been anxiety this whole time, I've never been able to find a pattern in my IBS flare ups, not trigger foods or anything it just felt completely at random, maybe it's been anxiety this whole damn time!\n\nThe strange thing is, there's nothing I'm particularly anxious about, I've got an amazing family, lovely wife, the best baby boy, a great job, no financial worries so I just don't know why this is happening, maybe I'm deficient in some vitamins or nutrients or something?! \n\n",

I did some more research and found another dentist. He just suggested a few fillings, said it wasn't a big deal, and scheduled more cleanings. Instead of $10,000, it was $3000.

I have had bouts of Hyperthyroidism in the past and I ended up doing the dumb thing and stopping my treatment so this could all just be because my thyroid went hyper plus I got sent into an anxiety spiral after witnessing a graphic video last month. All of this to say, these are the symptoms I've currently been experiencing:  \n\\-Elevated HR at rest (80s-90s)  \n\\-Chest pain (definitely tension related, I can push on my ribs and feel where it hurts)  \n\\-Dizziness/Lightheadedness (been dealing with this for years and instead of fixing it I've let it keep me housebound basically)  \n\\-Inability to really eat (for almost a month I've been eating between <1000kcal to 1700kcal a day, most days are between 1200-1500 though and I'm only accomplishing that through Ensure Plus shakes)  \n\\-Dry mouth/minimal saliva production  \n\\-Tremors  \n\\-Inability to sleep through a full night without waking up (could be dreaming about ANYTHING, not nightmare adjacent or anything)  \n\\-Inability to relax (I'm a gamer and have legit not been able to sit and focus on a game in literal weeks)  \n\\-Feeling like I'm losing my mind in my million miles a minute thoughts  \n\\-Anxiety, of course\n\nI know literally none of these are life threatening, I've just been so uncomfortable for legit 30 days that I don't know what else to do. Since I've neglected my health, I also don't have a PCP or anything to discuss this with, therefore I just don't know what the necessary steps are here.

I‚Äôm new here and I really need a place to let this out.\n\nI graduated in 2023 and started working right away, but both of my jobs since then have left me feeling really anxious and scared.\n\nMy first job was at a construction company. I worked there for 6 months as an admin and assistant to the vice general manager. The problem was that my boss had constant angry outbursts. On trips to job sites, he would get out of the car to argue (sometimes almost fight) with strangers on the road. Once, he even grabbed a baseball bat. He also made a huge scene in a mall over a receipt and yelled so badly at an employee that she cried. Being around that made me feel unsafe and constantly on edge.\n\nAfter that, I got hired at a shipyard as a warehouse encoder, but I only lasted a month. My supervisor disliked me from the start. I wasn‚Äôt trained properly, but she expected me to know everything right away. She complained about me to HR over small mistakes, talked badly about me to other departments, and insulted other coworkers by calling them ‚Äústupid‚Äù or ‚Äúuneducated.‚Äù When an Excel file got messed up, she immediately blamed me, even though multiple people used it.\n\nDuring both jobs, I noticed something happening in my body ‚Äî whenever I got nervous or stressed, my ears would turn hot and red. I always thought it was just nerves, but recently I read that this can actually be a symptom of anxiety.\n\nNow I don‚Äôt feel confident at all. I get scared of answering phones, especially when it‚Äôs for job interviews. I cry almost every night, overthinking about what might happen if I go back to work. I‚Äôm unemployed right now, but I don‚Äôt want to be a burden to my family. At the same time, I‚Äôm terrified of going through the same toxic situations again.\n\nI don‚Äôt know if what I‚Äôm experiencing is really anxiety, but it feels like my mental health is suffering. Has anyone else gone through this? How do I cope or rebuild my confidence before working again?\n\nI just desperately need help.",

I could not handle it so 2 days ago i went back to taking 25mg because i clearly cant come off of it right now.

      "selftext": "Hi everyone! It's my first post here. I've had anxiety and panic attacks for 8 years and it got really bad this year. I was diagnosed with agoraphobia and panic disorder and was prescribed xanax to stop panic attacks in april because i had really important exams to pass (the psychiatrist i saw told me my anxiety was due to the exams). Fast forward a few months (6 months), my anxiety isn't getting better, actually it's getting worse despite well... Not having those exams anymore, and i hate the effect Xanax has on me. I keep having intrusive thoughts and it makes me dissociate badly because my mind tries to panic but my body can't. I can barely go out for uni classes and buying food (i only do my groceries when i really need to) without having panic attacks or coming back home and having mental breakdown. Anyway so I thought enough was enough and i needed an actual treatment, not just Xanax. I went to a GP who offered to give me more xanax (i refused) and told me to go to therapy (i booked an appointment, unfortunately due to waiting lists it's in a month). My parents got worried my anxiety was turning into depression so they took me to another GP who said anxiety was my \"personality\" and gave me more xanax but now as a daily treatment. I only take it to reassure my parents (i'm an adult btw, I moved near my parents to try and ease my anxiety)\n\nI don't like that, i feel like i'm going to become an addict because you're not meant to take it daily. Everyone tells me to go see a therapist but they don't seem to believe in it? I don't know if it makes sense, English is not my first language. I've booked an appointment though, I'll do anything at this point. I've become more and more hopeless and overall exhausted from not getting any solutions and only getting told to \"try harder\". I force myself to go out but I'm losing hope. Has anyone been through something similar? Could you give me advice on what to do next ? Even a reality check or brutal honesty would be appreciated. I'm completely lost",

      "selftext": "Hi. Just wanted to find some reassurance or maybe hear some stories that could put me at ease. I've been having constant abdominal pain for 2 months, and since tests have come clean and nothing has been found with standard imaging (X-rays, US, bloodwork, CT scan earlier this year) doctors have basically discarded me. However, I'm trying to get a second opinion, and depending on the doctor and the country I know that it would be possible I might eventually get requested to do another CT scan to rule out things.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit worried about radiation exposure. Normal X-rays don't scare me since radiation is usually low, at most a few days of equivalent radiation, and I've been getting them once a year for screening since I got Covid. However, I'm concerned about CT scans due to the increased amount of radiation. My latest abdominal one was 10 mSv, and I know that if I get one with contrast it will be total 20 mSv. Some studies have shown this leads to an increased risk of developing tumors as low as 0.5% per scan, while I read other comments from a radiologist in Reddit who suggested that there's an increased 27% risk of leukemia per CT scan.\n\nSo this has been considering of instead advocating for a MRI. However, I know there's a considerable risk with contrast MRI due to the gadolinium-based contrast, which increases odds of later dementia by up to 25%, plus all of the horror stories shared in r/GadoliniumToxicity. So it's like choosing which one is better: increased risk of radiation or increased risk of dementia.\n\nI know that invasive procedures such as endoscopic ultrasound or colonoscopy won't be approved without first doing some imaging, so it's out of the question. So I'm seriously anxious about this situation. My therapist has also confirmed that, yes, there's an increased risk with everything I said before, so I just have to learn how to deal with this.\n\nI know there's a risk for everything, so maybe I'm just looking for some reassurance and maybe for people to share their experiences. Thanks for any words.",

I felt so ashamed of myself because when I got there, I saw the reality, people who couldn‚Äôt even walk 5 to 10 steps without gasping for air, while I had no problem climbing a 40-step stairs.\n\nThat same year, I was rushed to the ER again due to another panic attack. Everything came back normal, even my head CT scan. The ER doctor referred me to a neurologist because I kept complaining about dizziness and a fainting sensation.\n\nWhen I met my neurologist, I told him how much I was suffering. I couldn‚Äôt sleep even for a minute that entire month because every time I was about to fall asleep, I‚Äôd suddenly gasp for air, like I stopped breathing. My heart would pound so hard, it felt like I was dying. This also happened in the middle of the night. I told him about the constant fear and nervousness that sat in my chest 24/7, and he told me it was GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder).\n\nHe gave me a book by Claire Weekes about facing anxiety and panic, and prescribed Lexapro. The first week was hell, but after three weeks, the meds finally kicked in. For the first time in almost two months, I finally slept straight for 11 hours. My wife even joked that I slept like a baby.\n\nSince then, all my symptoms were gone and I felt like myself again. A year ago, we moved to my wife‚Äôs province, and since we‚Äôre a two-hour plane ride away, I could no longer follow up with my neurologist. Because I was feeling fine, I decided to stop taking my medication on my own last November 2024.\n\nThen this year, around May, because of stress and daily struggles at work, I started having daily anxiety and panic again, that same heavy feeling in my chest all day and all night. But this time, I knew how it worked, so I didn‚Äôt visit a doctor or go to the hospital. I just let the energy pass on its own.\n\nHowever, the scary symptoms that gave me insomnia two years ago are slowly coming back. The feeling of gasping for air as I fall asleep, and sometimes even waking up in the middle of my sleep gasping for air  followed by a super heavy chest and pounding heart. After 10 to 20 seconds of catching my breath, everything goes back to normal.\n\nFrom May to now (October), within six months of being anxious again, I‚Äôve experienced this about four or five times. The last episode was two months ago. And it happened today because I was crying in my dream. When I googled it, I saw ‚ÄúSleep Apnea.‚Äù\n\nMy question is: will a sleep study detect it even if it‚Äôs not happening daily? Because it only happens randomly, as I said, only 4 or maybe 5 times in six months.\n\nI work from home and usually sleep during the daytime. I can sleep anywhere from 6 to 11 hours a day. I asked my wife and kids if I snore, and they said I don‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt even feel fatigued. Since I work from home, I do home workouts six times a week, a 20-minute walking and dancing workout from YouTube, plus a 10-minute ab workout, and I still have the energy to work all night.\n\nNow I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs my anxious brain trying to convince me that I have sleep apnea, or if it‚Äôs just another manifestation of my daily anxiety and panic like what I had two years ago.\n\nFor those diagnosed with sleep apnea, can it be detected even if it doesn‚Äôt happen every night?",

      "selftext": "I have tightness in my chest and shortness of breath. I get a sore upper back too, I think that's just from posture which im working on. I saw a cardiologist, heart is good. Did a big blood panel- kidney, liver, thyroid all good, RBC and iron are great. Had an EGD, GI doc says no reflux just some gastritis. Bought a PEF meter to see if my childhood asthma has returned and even when I feel tight my PEF and FEV1 are good. I was taking Symbicort for 6 weeks, stopped taking it 2 weeks ago and I feel the same. Been on 5mg Lexapro for 17 days and I haven't felt a single thing good or bad. I don't have an issue with lying down, sleep, or excersize which also rule out asthma, heart issues and reflux. I sniff habitually and I constantly overbreath, and as we speak my sides are a bit sore internally like my intercostal muscles are overworked. So I pretty much have this narrowed down to a self-caused issue from stress \"tics\"- overbreathing and sniffing is hurting my chest and back and of course the common anxiety air hunger is its own issue. Here's why im asking about Benzos- if I take just 25mg of Tramadol, it relaxes me and simultaneously makes me feel positive and almost energetic. The internal stress fades away and i stop overbreathing. I feel like I can breath pretty much normally. I wonder if like two weeks of taking Tramadol daily, just 25mg, would help knock me out of this cycle, give my chest a chance to rest and heal and put me back on the right track. Ive been working on my breathing, excersizing, diet etc for 2 months and I just can't break the habit of my stress tics. The issue is it's doubtful my doc will prescribe me Tramadol as an anti-anxiety med lol. He probably would prescribe me a short course of Benzos though. Opinions?",

      "selftext": "Good morning, I'm a 37 year old male who has had issues with anxiety for about 20 years which are probably caused by some trauma I experience at around 13-14 years of age (stuff I know I should probably speak to a psychologist about but have always put off for just being too proud). Over the years I've refused to be medicated in fear it would somehow interfere with my productivity at school or work. Looking back now that's probably why I started to self medicate with alcohol since my early 20's. Drinking alcohol now makes me feel really anxious in the morning, if I have a hang over, forget it, full blown panic attack every time. Thinking I will have a heart attack at any moment. \n\n  \nI have a high stress job with a lot of responsibilities and a lot of pressure. I also have been trying to have a baby with my wife for 5 years, have gone through IVF recently and my wife had a miscarriage with the only viable embryo. My mother has been diagnosed with a non operable lung cancer. So, a lot going on. I've had more and more panic attacks, sometimes driving, sometimes finding myself hiding in a bathroom at work before a meeting or presentation, basically losing it. So I decided to finally talk about it with my doctor.\n\n  \nHe's prescribed me 25mg Sertraline with a dose that will go up in a week and a month off of work. In my mind I know I should probably take it but I'm still afraid. I feel like without the pressure of work and stopping to drink, and doing things that make me happy, I may be able to naturally get better. I just don't know what to do. I can stop drinking, I've done it before and it really did help my anxiety. \n\nAm I being stupid? Should I just take the meds and see what happens? It's dumb, but thinking of taking the meds is giving me anxiety. If anyone could offer some similar stories maybe, or some advice, I would really appreciate you. Thank you everyone. ",

I'm 30 years old and have been struggling with anxiety on and off for many years, particularly social anxiety which I tend to get avoidant of things because of. I started a new job this year in parks for the city and it has been a really relaxing and healthy work environment, however after experiencomg a lot of social anxiety day to day at work and feeling resistant to it, I started to feel burnt out from my job and going in in the mornings started to feel harder and harder, especially because I have to get up pretty early, 5AM, and I'm not much of a morning person. I started getting into the habit of calling in sick on Monday mornings because of always feeling so tired. I hurt my back one week and couldn't work out which usually helps me somewhat manage my anxiety levels and I think it caused me to spiral a bit, I've also been smoking a lot of weed recently because I started to mix it with tobacco again and have started to think that is having adverse affects on my sleep now. A few weeks ago I started waking up in the middle of the night and shoot out of bed with anxiety and it just feels like pure fear and almost like a claustraphobic feeling and can't lie still. I get scared to go back to bed and often have to get up and go for a walk or something. After calling in sick for over a week due to this anxiety building from loss of sleep and avoidance of work for really bad and then I got a bad cough and sickness and have now been off for more than 2 weeks. I know they would be understanding at work because they are very accepting of disabilities and mental health conditions but now that I've been off for so long the anxiety about going in to work just continues to grow and it's getting harder to sleep. I can't afford to miss any more time off work but I feel like it's been really hard to get a grip on my mental health. I'm sometimes in tears in the morning or middle of the night because of I'm so tired of this feeling of pure fear. I'm starting to try therapy but it's hard because I can't afford to do too much. Does anyone have any other suggestions or can relate? Thanks ",

      "selftext": "I was eating biscuits and I chew them to liquid or mush, due to my emetophobia and fear of choking. Etc.\n\nBut I don't know what happened but when I bit into the biscuit, (Chocolate digestive biscuits.) I think I remember a little piece or whatever falling of it, at the back of my mouth. (I don't think I swallowed it because I don't remember feeling anything going down my throat until I chewed and swallowed.)\n\nBut I can feel a crumb or something of the biscuit is stuck in my throat. And I'm honestly terrified. I can drink, talk, breathe, I even ate some yogurts and I was fine.\n\nBut I know it's stuck there. And I'm unsure of what to do. And I'm honestly terrified. I think it's just a crumb of the biscuit. But a part of me is convinced is a slightly bigger piece of the biscuit, that fell of the piece I was eating that was slightly at the back of my mouth.\n\nI'm really scared and getting anxious right now. I've coughed. I've laughed. I've drank water. And I've ate. But it's still there I can feel it. And it's a real thing. And not globus. (I've had globus a lot. To know the difference.)\n\nI know it's from the biscuit due to the feeling of it. I'm laying down on my stomach right now and everytime I clench and unclench my throat I can feel it at the side of my throat. So I know it's there. I just don't know what to do and I'm honestly terrified.\n\nHas anybody else had this from eating biscuits as well? Or crackers? Etc? Honestly terrified.\n\nI know this is silly. But when you have a choking phobia and emetophobia in the mix it's really scary. And I Hyper-focus on my throat so much. But there's definitely a crumb or a small piece of the biscuit there. Because I can feel it when swallowing sometimes, etc. (And I've had small on-and-off pain in my throat.) And its been making me wanna gag etc. And I'm convinced the piece Is bigger then a crumb and that's why it's stuck. \n\nI do suffer with acid reflux symptoms. But I know it's not that, that's causing this it was the biscuit itself.\n\nI feel really silly, for posting this and being scared. But im so convinced it's a bigger piece stuck in my throat. My throat is now uncomfortable. And I'm having slight acid due to it etc etc. I don't know how big it is, in my throat. But I think it's just a slightly bigger biscuit crumb I think?\n\nI've been googling as well. Which is making me feel more scared. I know it's not gonna help.\n\n(I'm not choking, wheezing, or having choking symptoms. But the piece or the crumb or whatever it is. is still stuck there. And I can feel it clearly.)\n\nUpdate: drank some hot herbal tea, and it's still there. And also the reason why I feel like it's not globus is because I'm not having tightness or pressure. And whenever I felt like something was stuck in my throat. It never felt like a real object. But this one feels like a real proper piece of the biscuit. Because I can feel it. But with globus I never actually felt a piece or an object. But with this I can feel a object in my throat due to the biscuit from earlier.\n\n√ó√ó√ó√ó\n\n\nUpdate: it's been hours. And no matter how much I cough, drink, etc. It just isn't moving. So now it's gotten to the point where I can't tell if a actual piece of biscuit is stuck somewhere in my throat at the side. or it's snatched. Or it's globus.\n\nI've even drank hot herbal tea because I know tea, makes biscuits dissolve and mushy. So I though It was a good idea. But it didn't do anything. I've ate a few yogurts. Didn't do anything drank water. Didn't do anything. Coughed. Didn't do anything. Had my acid-reflux medicine. And didn't do anything.\n\nAll im experiencing is the same biscuit-y feeling at the side of my throat like an actual piece is stuck. Like it feel dry, and crumbly, in one spot of my throat. With no tightness etc. But I have been experiencing on-and-off throat pains all day.\n\nI'm gonna leave it until tomorrow to see if I notice any difference.\n\n√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó\n\nI have just saw some people's comments about OCD, and I'm looking in it! And I'm gonna get therapy when able to. I never thought about the possibility of OCD.\n",

Het werd in de loop van de dag beter, maar ik heb sindsdien continu moeite met scherpstellen.\n\nBelangrijke achtergrondinformatie:\n\t‚Ä¢\t2 jaar geleden heb ik LASIK gehad op mijn rechteroog.\n\t‚Ä¢\t1,5 jaar geleden no-touch laser op mijn linkeroog.\n\t‚Ä¢\tTijdens de eerste operatie lukte het niet goed op mijn linker oog vanwege een probleem tijdens de procedure.\n\nIk ben al bij de dokter geweest, maar er werd gezegd dat er niets opvallends was. Ik maak me zorgen dat er iets mis is met de manier waarop mijn ogen scherpstellen of dat er een neurologisch probleem is.\n\nHeeft iemand ervaring met iets vergelijkbaars, of tips over wat ik kan doen/vragen bij de oogarts?\n\nAlvast bedankt!\n",

It started when my fianc√© died of a heart attack right in front of me. He was only 33.\n\nSince then I've seen psychiatrist, psychologist, tried different therapies, started yoga, talked to great specialists, downloaded apps, read countless self-help books, success stories of people who beat anxiety and lived through ups and downs.\n\nNow what I say. I say 7 years later. I was not thinking the same way not even a year ago. It's a new kind of state of mind, still weak, but growing, after all the help, medical checks, guidance, and support I've gone through.\n\nAnd here it is.\n\nAfter all these years of putting anxiety on a pedestal higher than myself - **Do I have a condition, or am I conditioning myself?**\n\nThis realization came to my mind when I was searching yet another video on YouTube and typed *\"Background music to lower anxiety\"*.\n\nIt's just a tiny example of all the searches or thought patterns I've gone through 7 years, but always with the same concept - ‚ÄúHow to get rid of anxiety fast‚Äù, ‚ÄúHow to live with anxiety‚Äù, \"That's how I beat my anxiety\", \"Exercises to lower anxiety\".\n\nI realized that these past 7 years every thought and behaviour has gone through the anxiety filter first - *Will this help my anxiety? Will this calm me down? Will this make my anxiety worst?*\n\nBut never: *Do I actually want to do this? Do I choose to do it because I like it or it's fun or it's just completely okay to do it.*\n\nI do daily yoga ‚Äî because it helps with anxiety.\n\nI go for a run ‚Äî because it helps with anxiety\n\nAnd so much more I do - because it helps with anxiety.\n\nIf I have never put myself as first but all the time lived for a condition and identified myself through that and calculated every action weather or not it is suitable for my anxiety..I mean no surprise it stays here.\n\nYesterday I went for an evening run and said to myself - I go for a run because I like it. I like to keep myself moving and since I was a kid, I've been a pretty okay runner. So I just go. \n\nNo big miracle happened. But something was different. I felt it.\n\nIt's not that I made a big discovery, but I wanted to share it today - on a mental health day.\n\nHave a great weekend everybody!",

      "title": "How to support husband through tough conversations",
      "selftext": "My husband (27M) has always struggled to connect with his emotions, particularly \"negative\" emotions. His family is very invalidating and instilled some pretty harmful beliefs about himself, like making him believe that he's only worthy when he's useful, or that it's his fault when bad things happen, or he'll never be as good as his older brother (who is one of the most specialized doctors in the country while my husband has a diploma and ADHD. Not saying one is better than the other but you can imagine the comparison his family makes). He's usually a very positive, goofy person, but whenever we have difficult conversations, he completely shuts down. I know he really cares about what I'm trying to say and how I feel about various situations, but it's really hard to engage with him when he's like this. He completely blanks, and the only words he seems to be able to access are \"I don't know\", or small agreements with whatever I'm saying. I'm not proud to say this, but I can get pretty frustrated when it feels like I'm doing all the talking and he's not engaging, and I've pushed him further in an effort to get him to talk, but it usually just makes it worse. It doesn't seem to matter what we're talking about, but if he feels like he did something wrong or the fault lies with him, he has the same reaction. \n\nToday, I tried bringing up a difficult topic again, and after a while, I realized that his skin was red and itchy and he was sweating. I became worried almost immediately and rubbed his back while trying to cool him down. After about a minute, he was able to respond to me (despite the fact that I had dropped the original conversation at this point) and even cried which is super rare for him. He was able to name his sadness and guilt and even said that he thinks I could do way better than him. He said that he feels isolated and helpless when we don't talk after a fight. I'm now wondering if every time I've tried to talk to him before, he was having some sort of silent panic attack. I feel awful that I didn't realize what was happening and even pushed him further out of his comfort zone when I initially thought he just didn't want to engage in a conversation with me. \n\nI've suggested therapy to him before but he doesn't seem to think he needs it since he feels fine most of the time. He went once but I don't think it was a good fit for him and the therapist so he feels like therapy in general isn't useful for him. Any suggestions on how I can be a better support to him as his wife and/or how to bring up the topic of therapy to him again in a way that might land would be greatly appreciated. üíï",

Simple things like talking in class, meeting new people, or even walking into a crowded room made my heart race. I thought I was broken, and I kept everything bottled up.\nWhat changed wasn‚Äôt some magical cure, but small steps. I started noticing my triggers, writing them down, and practicing breathing exercises whenever I felt panic coming. Slowly, I began to see patterns and realized I wasn‚Äôt powerless‚ÄîI could actually respond differently.\nIt wasn‚Äôt easy, and I still have tough days, but I‚Äôve learned that progress is about consistency, not perfection. Tracking my thoughts and reactions gave me clarity I never had before. That‚Äôs why I eventually put together a simple guide with exercises and a daily tracker‚Äîbecause I know how lost you can feel without a roadmap.\nIf you‚Äôre struggling, please know you‚Äôre not alone. Change is possible, even if it feels slow. One small step at a time really does add up.",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm (23, male) and today is **Day 7** on 5mg of Escitalopram (it's called Elicea here in Slovakia). I wanted to share my experience from this first, incredibly difficult week and see if anyone can relate.\n\n**Background:** I started this medication after a major life crisis. I was dealing with extreme stress, which led to my first-ever panic attacks. This triggered severe anxiety, Health OCD (with scary neurological-feeling symptoms), and a deep depression with anhedonia (no pleasure in anything). To make things worse, I was also forced to quit a very heavy nicotine pouch addiction (Siberia) at the same time.\n\nMy psychiatrist started me on 5mg of Elicea, with a plan to go up to 10mg soon.\n\n**The First Week - A Timeline of Hell:**\n\n* **Day 1-2:** The fear of starting was immense. About an hour after the first dose, I felt a strange, intense \"wave\" of sedation and derealization that was terrifying. But I also had a brief moment of calm after, which gave me some hope.\n* **Days 3-5 (The Peak):** This was the absolute worst part. I have never felt so bad in my life. The side effects hit me with full force:\n   * **Intense Sedation:** A feeling of \"forced muscle relaxation\" that made my body feel heavy and weak, like I couldn't walk properly.\n   * **Extreme Agitation (Akathisia):** At the same time, I felt an unbearable inner restlessness. I couldn't lie down or be still. It felt like my body was relaxed but my brain was screaming \"MOVE!\"\n   * **Depersonalization/Derealization (DP/DR):** This was the scariest part. I felt like I was losing my mind, that my \"sense of self\" was gone, and that everything was unreal or \"misaligned.\"\n   * **OCD/Intrusive Thoughts:** My intrusive thoughts got much worse, including scary Harm OCD thoughts, which was terrifying.\n   * **Insomnia:** I couldn't sleep properly due to the agitation, which made the daytime exhaustion even worse.\n* **Days 6-7 (The Turning Point?):** Over the last two days, I've started to notice the first small changes. The intense \"wave\" after my daily dose is much weaker or not there at all. The sedation, while still present, is noticeably less heavy than it was on the weekend. Most importantly, for a few hours in the late evening, I've had moments of feeling \"normal\" and stable, with a much clearer head.\n* **THE OVERALL PROBLEM** \\- Mine problem with elicea is that that it deconstructed my identity and i feel like no one, no interests anything, increse in self harm toughts, i have racing toughts about being crazy i cant concentrate, i cant love, i cant enjoy enything, it just took my anxiety attacks away but took more than that, i have also physical symptoms like head dizznes, dry mouth, weight loss, appetite loss etc... i know its first week but am unable to do anything :( its scary and even more depressing. Please someone help me i know its just adjustment period but i dont think this drug should be acting like this.\n\n**My Questions:**\n\nI'm holding onto those good evenings as proof that this can work. My biggest fear is that the bad feelings will last forever.\n\nFor those of you who had a similarly rough first week, did you also experience those \"clear evenings\" before the good feeling started to spread to the rest of the day? And when did you really start to feel consistently better?\n\nThanks for reading. My girlfriend has been an amazing support through all of this, but it would be great to hear from people who've been in this exact spot.\n\nAlso should i increase the dose to 10mg as i was said by the doc ? or shouldi stay one more week on this dose before upgrading.",

I‚Äôve recently had heart palpitations every day for two months. Recently it‚Äôs been waking me up in the middle of the night feeling like myheart is pounding and I can literally feel it banging in my chest, not so much racing just pounding constantly. \n I‚Äôve done multiple tests - ECGs, chest x-ray, thyroid test and halter monitor and they cannot find anything so they‚Äôre ruling it down to anxiety even though I don‚Äôt mentally feel anxious. Every now and then I feel a bit mentally anxious BECAUSE of the heart palpitations so it‚Äôs a bit of a catch 22. There‚Äôs literally nothing else that I feel anxious about and majority of the time it‚Äôs physical symptoms not mental which is very new to me. I‚Äôve tried seeing a psychologist and I feel like it‚Äôs not really helping at all either. \n\nMy doctor previously recommended propranolol to help with the feelings of  palpitations.

Did you guys have symptoms like this with zoloft or other SSRIs? I know they say you have to power through the side effects, but that was so bad, it felt like I was greening out on edibles and there was no way I could function taking that or continue to take them. Could it have been the dosage that caused that? Is it worth trying other SSRIs, or is it possible that I just don‚Äôt do well with serotonin? They gave me hydoroxizine for emergencies, so I at least have that.

My medication dose has not been touched since I was 18. I had a Telehealth with my GP to discuss this and my medication and he was reluctant to up my antidepressants but offered me a benzodiazepine (which I declined because that‚Äôs not what I think I need and I‚Äôm already on a stimulant) and then told me I‚Äôm probably not the kind of person suited to be a doctor or in a manager role because of my anxiety. I left feeling awful about myself and maybe I can‚Äôt achieve my dreams because of my condition. At the end he said I can try taking 1.5 tablets of my fluvoxamine but he doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôll do anything until I quit my job. Is he right or was he being unreasonable? ",

      "selftext": "Hi yall it's currently almost 1am. I have traffic court tomorrow. I've never been to traffic court before so that alone is a bit intimidating, but the possible result is what has me in knots. \n\nA few weeks ago I was in an accident. I'm fine, no one was hurt but my car was totaled. It was raining and I didn't see that at a 4 way intersection, my road had flashing red and the other was flashing yellow. I honestly thought it was a 4 way stop\n\nAnyways, I was given a ticket for the accident. I then lost the ticket because I'm so forgetful and missed the court date. So now it's rescheduled for tomorrow\n\nThe reason I'm so tore up over this is I work for doordash/instacarr/spark. They did a background check review after the accident and Im still good BUT they don't know about the ticket from the accident because it's not on your record till it's a conviction. \n\nSo essentially my only hope is that I can convince the judge to lessen the charge to a non moving violation. If they agree, great, none of the apps will know and life goes on... If they won't change it, as soon as it's entered, they will likely do another auto background check and see the ticket and I might lose my source of income. \n\nI'm trying to tell myself that I'm probably overreacting, and no one is out to get me.  I just can't help but think what if the judge says \"I feel sorry for you but if I do this for you I'd have to do it for everyone, so my hands are tied\"\n\nIf yall read all of this, thank you. Any advice or words of wisdom, ideas or what to say would be greatly appreciated ",

      "title": "Anxiety and symptoms (TRIGGER WARNING)",
      "selftext": "Hello. So I (FTM22) think I've been experiencing extreme panic attack and anxiety for over a week. \n\nHere is my experience. I'm posting this in mildly full detail.\n\nI'd like to put a disclaimer: I am not looking for a diagnosis in any way. I have a panic and anxiety disorder diagnosed already but what I've been experiencing this week has been worse than anything i've experienced before. I have spoken to my therapist about it and my doctor, but I've been struggling so bad to put into words EXACTLY what I've been experiencing. But they are both fully and entirely aware of this.\nI have also received medical care this week for it on numerous occasions which I will go into detail about in this post. This is not only purely out of curiosity, but also to distract myself right now as I am currently going through a bad one right now. I also feel so alone in what I'm experiencing and I need to just talk about it. \n\n\nA week ago I started feeling pain and full awareness of everything in my body. \nMy bones, especially my spine, ribs, and knees were extremely weak and throbbing pain. I then proceeded to sneeze which abruptly stopped before it could finish and that terrified me. That was the start of it all. I started panicking worse than I ever have. I left it alone for the night hoping it's go away. Eventually falling asleep with the help of my husband's comfort. Digestion was more painful it would jolt me away. And from this day till now I'd vomit at least once a night. I have a whole list of symptoms I've been experiencing but don't feel too comfortable listing them all.\n\nThe next night. \nI started feeling the same thing, but this pain persisted the whole week. I have felt many symptoms related to gallstone and even seizure symptoms (minus the seizure). My heart began to hurt and I was feeling a sense of doom. Usually I hesitate to have my husband call the paramedics, but I was very fast to it as I was completely under the impression I was dying. \nThey came by, checked my vitals. I was completely fine. But that didn't explain why I was in so much pain, panicky, and why my bones and muscles felt so weak and sensitive, as if they could break from the smallest pressure. \n\nThis proceeded for 2 days. \nOn the 3rd day I called the paramedics again. Completely convinced again something was wrong. \nI was still fine. Symptoms proceeded to the next day. \n\n4th day\nI made the decision to go to the ER. \nThey did a CT scan and other tests and... Again... I'm fine. Nothing in my abdomen should be causing me the pain I have been feeling. Aside from a minor common hernia (the doctors said it wasn't a case for concern and shouldn't be causing me such pain), my vitals and organs were fine. So I went home. Hoping I'd be ok with that closure. \nI went home, and I felt pressure in my lungs. Like a jolt of pressure. And another sense of doom. My husband called the EMTs again. Vitals were fine. \nSo I went to bed, having to lay in a position that didn't feel like my ribs were breaking. \n\n\n5th day (today) \nAll symptoms listed above, as well as throbbing in my chest and a sense of doom is all I'm experiencing. And still lots of pain.\n\n\n I have an appointment with my primary doctor tomorrow and hopefully that could lead to more tests and possibly other things that could help. \n\nI'd like to mention I am on a prescription of Ritilin for my ADHD and Omeprazol for my GERD.  \n\n\nTo reiterate. I am NOT interested in a diagnosis. I'm sure I'm probably suffering a severe anxiety/panic attack. I just wanted to share my experiences and see if others have experience the same thing. And possibly get closure on it as all medical closure I've gotten could only do so much in regards to physical worries. Also, again, out of comfort I have left out some symptoms as I'm not comfortable providing them. Every symptom listed above appeared each night.  \n\nEdit: After posting this, I'm still really anxious, but the type of anxious that you get from sending a post in a subreddit you've never been in and on an app you are new to, but I feel a lot more calm. My neck feels tense still, but posting this and telling my experience genuinely helped a little bit. Hopefully I can stay this stable for the rest of the night. ",

But I was feeling quite anxious last night and I was panicking so I took one before bed.\nAlthough my heart rate was below 100, my heart felt restless and stressed out. Like I could feel it existing in my body and my chest felt tight.\n\nI felt myself become slightly calm about a couple of hours after taking propranolol. My heart still felt a bit stressed out but I tried to ignore it. I fell asleep but then I woke up couple of hours later, I was sweating and shivering. My mouth was dry and there was no saliva.\nI started panicking, thinking of the worse case scenario.\nI stupidly googled my symptoms and results showed I might be having a heart attack or might have some heart disease. I started panicking even more. I went to A&E last month as my heart rate was over 120. They checked my bloods and did an ECG, everything was normal.

When my anxiety is bad, my eyelids twitch and retract like crazy and I end up blinking a bunch because I get so hyper focused on it.\n\nWhen I‚Äôm alone and relaxed, like watching TV or just hanging out, my eyes are fine. The retraction still happens if I move my eyes really fast, but it‚Äôs not nearly as bad.\n\nI‚Äôve never seen anyone online describe this same issue. I‚Äôve searched Reddit and other forums and haven‚Äôt found a single post about it. I explained it to my doctor and he said it‚Äôs just nerves. He prescribed Ativan for my anxiety and when I took it, the problem completely disappeared. I could make eye contact normally and everything felt fine.\n\nI stopped taking Ativan because it‚Äôs a benzodiazepine and I don‚Äôt want to be dependent on it. Now I‚Äôm back to square one and can‚Äôt stop thinking about it. I have OCD, so I tend to hyper fixate on small issues like this until they consume me. It‚Äôs gotten to the point where I dream about it and it‚Äôs affecting my confidence and social life.\n\nHas anyone else gone through this or heard of anything similar? I feel like I‚Äôm going crazy not being able to find anyone who relates.\n",

      "selftext": "Background on me. 42/male/5‚Äô8‚Äù & 205lbs with 15yrs of Naval service on submarines. I‚Äôve been fighting with hypertension for going on 5yrs. I‚Äôve been on HCTZ/Lisinopril for going on 2yrs, but I was terrible at keeping up with my doses. I can‚Äôt pinpoint when it started but I vaguely recall becoming super anxious when flying a few yrs ago. I used to love flying and being underwater in a sub never bothered me one bit (so it‚Äôs not claustrophobia). I also started having thoughts of ‚Äúhow much longer I have before I die?‚Äù. This would make me take an hour or so just to fall asleep and would happen EVERY night! I ended up finding headphones that were comfy for sleep and the music would preoccupy my mind long enough for me to fall asleep. \n\nLong story short, I travel occasionally for my job and 2 months ago I was on work travel and started feeling arm numbness in both arms and random lightheadedness. I came home and started taking my meds every day. The arm numbness continued and got lightheaded when I was sitting at my desk. Called the doc and they recommended I go to the ER to just be safe.\n\nBlood pressure was checked and came in around 140/90. Blood tests and x-ray came back negative for stroke/heart attack. MRI of brain found a few blood vessels are becoming restricted due to poor BP care. So let‚Äôs just say this has compounded on top of my anxiety. Fast forward and my BP kept spiking, started experiencing chest pain, but 2 ER visits later each came back negative for stroke or heart attack. Heart is healthy and strong. So somewhat good news. I have another work trip to Hawaii (where I‚Äôm at now) and I wake up with middle back pain and BP is 153/112. Go to ER here and same thing. I have a phone consult with my doc and she prescribes me 10mg Hydroxyzine. I take 2 as instructed before bed the past 2 nights and it‚Äôs been night and day. BP has been in the normal ranges but I still feel small anxiety attacks randomly.\n\nI have a cardiology appointment after I get back next week, so hopefully it‚Äôs nothing heart related and I just need to get this anxiety under control. Has anyone had similar experiences?What are some options do I have to try and help?",

      "selftext": "hi everyone. i hope this is an ok place to post. starting randomly about 2.5 months ago i got really dizzy, like the room was spinning. i dont remember anything specific triggering it. since then its been near constant. the best way i can describe it is like my head feels heavy, and like theres static in it. its not always room spinning dizziness although i do get that too. its almost like when you hold your breath and get light headed, or stand up too fast and get dizzy. my eyes always feel hard to focus. its so so unbearable to live with. i went to the doctor and she immediately just told me it was anxiety. i got a lexapro perscription but i hate taking medication so i havent started yet. its worse when im standing, move my head around too fast, and i notice its worse when i eat for some reason. i guess my question is- has anyone else experienced this? can it really be anxiety? i do have general anxiety but i dont feel like its triggered by things that make me anxious, and its 24/7. tia :/",

When we presented our project, it quickly became clear that its quality was nowhere near the other groups'. I spiraled. Got all nauseous. Convinced myself that my whole GPA was tanked, that I'd have to repeat the class, and therefore stay an extra semester, all within the span of about a minute. \n\nWhile I held it together (read: didn't cry), my classmates noticed that I was distressed. I spoke to the professor afterwards, and got reassured that my class performance was satisfactory, but left feeling like an idiot. \n\nI know it was the caffeine.

This might not make sense, but I know that when you are in labor and/or giving birth, you are on drugs to make the pain lessen. I have heard that these don't alter your mind and I have heard that they make your lower body numb. This makes me very scared. If I feel \"off\" sometimes, even completely sober, I start thinking I might be high and have a panic attack. \n\n  \nWhat do I do? Never have a child? Have a child without the drugs? Suck it up?",

My aunt obviously taking on the lead role as usual, no problem with that, except for the fact that everything has to be perfect and neat. Playing Christmas games, and I never know what to get that everyone can enjoy (if you have suggestions that would be appreciated) and obviously the Christmas presents themselves. This year is different, I‚Äôm 18 now, I‚Äôm and adult, I don‚Äôt see myself that way but that‚Äôs how society sees it. As an adult I feel like it‚Äôs my ‚Äúduty‚Äù to give everyone a Christmas gift, I‚Äôve never given anyone one before. Now that may seem pretty rude to some people, and I honestly have no excuse, other than the fact that buying Christmas gifts is one of the biggest cause to my anxiety, not only during Christmas, but it‚Äôs in the top three list of overall things that causes my anxiety. I genuinely don‚Äôt know what to do this year, it‚Äôs not like I don‚Äôt want to, it‚Äôs just that it gives me so much dread. We are not that many in my family, but that doesn‚Äôt change it.

I have no idea what to do, I could tell my aunt because we have a pretty good bond, but I know she would tell me what she always tells me ‚ÄúJust buy something, it doesn‚Äôt have to be big‚Äù and she always says it with this ‚Äúnothing in life is too complicated, just do it‚Äù mindset.

Part of the anxiety is now reading that 60mg a day is an enormous dose to start with. I had planned to take two more tablets this evening but I‚Äôm now scared.

      "selftext": "\nDoxycycline and Anxiety (October 2025)\n\nHey everyone,\n\nI wanted to share my experience in case it helps someone else going through something similar.\n\nI‚Äôm a 30-year-old male ‚Äî healthy overall, running 4‚Äì5 km every other day ‚Äî until last week when everything suddenly shifted after starting Apo-Doxycycline (100 mg, twice daily) for what was thought to be a sinus infection.\n\n‚∏ª\n\nüè• How it started\n\nLast Sunday, I went to the ER for sinus pain from a lingering cold. I got checked out, prescribed doxycycline, and headed home.\n\nAfter just four pills total (two days), I noticed something strange ‚Äî I was hit with waves of anxiety and depression out of nowhere. I‚Äôd cry randomly, feel tense all day, and couldn‚Äôt figure out why.\n\nI kept thinking, ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt me.‚Äù\n\nBy Tuesday, I finally connected the dots after reading others‚Äô experiences online and decided to stop taking it.\n\n‚∏ª\n\nüå§Ô∏è What happened next\n\nIt‚Äôs now Thursday afternoon. The worst of the anxiety and depression has faded, but I‚Äôm still dealing with mild nausea, brain fog, and fatigue here and there. Nothing like before, though ‚Äî definitely improving.\n\nFor anyone wondering: doxycycline‚Äôs half-life is around 18‚Äì22 hours, meaning it usually clears out in 3‚Äì5 days. Because I only took a few doses, things are settling faster.\n\n‚∏ª\n\n‚öóÔ∏è Why this can happen\n\nEven short courses of doxycycline can affect some people‚Äôs:\n\t‚Ä¢\tGut microbiome, which plays a role in serotonin and mood\n\t‚Ä¢\tStress hormones (cortisol), leading to anxiety or restlessness\n\t‚Ä¢\tGABA balance, which influences calmness and sleep\n\nAdd being sick, tired, or dehydrated ‚Äî and it can easily trigger mood changes.\n\n‚∏ª\n\nüåø What‚Äôs helping me recover\n\nThese are the things that have made a big difference:\n‚úÖ Staying hydrated ‚Äî water and electrolytes help flush things out\n‚úÖ Eating light, gut-friendly meals ‚Äî soups, fruits, yogurt, kefir\n‚úÖ Avoiding caffeine and alcohol ‚Äî both can spike anxiety\n‚úÖ Taking short walks ‚Äî gentle movement helps calm the nervous system\n‚úÖ Breathing and grounding ‚Äî slow breathing or warm showers really help reset my body\n‚úÖ Getting as much sunlight as possible  \n\n‚∏ª\n\n‚è≥ What to expect\n\nFrom what I‚Äôve read and now experienced:\n\t‚Ä¢\tWithin 2‚Äì3 days, mood and anxiety symptoms start easing\n\t‚Ä¢\tWithin a week, most people feel close to baseline\n\t‚Ä¢\tIf it lasts beyond 10‚Äì14 days, check in with your doctor ‚Äî sometimes gut support or a mild temporary treatment helps\n\n‚∏ª\n\nI‚Äôll post an update once I‚Äôm fully back to normal ‚Äî hopefully soon. If you‚Äôre dealing with this too, hang in there. You‚Äôre not alone, and it does get better once the meds leave your system. üí™",

Don‚Äôt spiral.\n\nExample micro-challenges\n\n* Day 1: One cashier conversation, one open-ended question\n* Day 7: Ask a colleague for their take on a topic\n* Day 21: Join a short group chat, contribute once\n\nWhat changed\n\n* Fewer physical anxiety spikes\n* Faster recovery when I stumble\n* More natural flow, even with strangers\n\nI‚Äôm happy to answer questions in-thread.

Nothing bad is happening at the job, I do my work, I do it alright, I am not forced to adhere to a strict schedule (I can be late/leave early with no penalty as long as I have everything done) and it's all good. It's as good of a job as I can get for this.\n\nBut my whole body hurts. It feels inflamed, my arms and legs are shaking with tremors and I feel beaten (despite eating and sleeping normally). I still feel burned out and I don't know how to help myself. My therapist told me few exercises for decompression and they are not really helping. Every day I feel worse and worse and I know that consciously nothing is going on. \n\nI just want my body to stop hurting and vibrating and being anxious like this, because my conscious mind knows we are fine and we have a good job.

I was referred to a cardiologist. has a holter monitor and echo and all tests came back normal and i was put at ease and my obsession wore off. \n\nFast forward to august i had a very bad panic attack which caused dizziness and up until now the dizziness hasn't gone away. i've been to A&E and to my gp and i have been given multiple diagnoses of Sinusitis, Labrithitis and most recently BPPV. i have been given medication (Betahistine) which does not help. I am on propranolol aswell as promethazine. I just cannot shake that there is something seriously wrong with me and everything is getting brushed off. I constantly feel like im in a boat swaying i've thought it was my breathing but when i'm not feeling anxious the feeling is still there. When i think about the dizziness it intensifies. the floor feels wobbly when i walk. my bed feels like it's moving when i'm trying to sleep. i cannot keep living like this and i feel no one is listening. i honestly feel like im just going to pass out one day. i having multiple panic attacks daily. i just don't know what to do anymore.

Between the start of this term and now, so much has happened in my personal life and as a result I‚Äôm just so burnt out. Just as I was willing to accept defeat, a couple days ago the minor department offers me a scholarship of $4000, I guess based on one essay I wrote, my good gpa, and perhaps the fact that there are so few people within this minor program to begin with. \n\nThis would have felt great if I didn‚Äôt totally just bomb my midterm last night. I studied as best I could over the past couple weeks but it was my first ever online proctored exam and I just froze like a kid on a theatre stage having forgot all his lines.   \n\nI had accommodations too, so my time to complete the exam was extended an hour. A whole extra hour I just stared at my word doc, back at myself in the zoom chat and then back at the word doc, occasionally glancing at the essay question again m and then back to my blank word doc.\n\nI couldn‚Äôt believe it. I couldn‚Äôt believe how stuck I was. After everyone left the zoom chat I just started balling my eyes out to the prof. Now I‚Äôm wondering, do I email them apologizing for how awkward that all was, explain to them how I froze? ‚Äî-problem is don‚Äôt even know how I froze that badly. What do I do about this scholarship? It‚Äôs pretty embarrassing they gave it to someone who *had* a high gpa and is on track for that to plummet this term.\n",

It's been a while since then and I've noticed these little things popping up with time and despite my desperate urge to push my anxious thoughts away I'm worrying they are signs of something bad. Without going into detail or being gross, I've been passing stool infrequently and the time i have they appear light in colour and with an off look and smell, I've started getting a pain in the side that doesn't appear to be appendicitis or anything considering its comes and goes and doesn't appear when i walk or cough. It feels like wind and likely is since sometimes the pain leaves when there is. I still eat food just fine but don't really do it out of hunger like i used to and more do it out of a necessity. I haven't been losing weight and if anything have actually been gaining little by little, and now my body has started subtly trembling, the worst being at night or when i awake in the morning.\n\nI've given samples and had a blood test and am still awaiting on the results, the doctor didn't seem too worried when i told my symptoms and mentioned something about either celiac or malabsorption so that's a possibility but I'd be lying if I said i wasn't nervous. Nothing feels like it used to, my body doesn't feel like i used to, all these new problems have come up or it feels like new problems have shown up and its both frustrating and upsetting to think i will never go back to how i used to feel. In truth, I'm scared, I'm scared my body is shutting down or going through something bad and I'm unaware until it finally claims me and i just don't wake up one day. \n\nI've already given samples and gone to the doctor so all i can do is wait and hope for the best.\n\nEdit: I'm sorry if this sounds like a lot, I'm honestly at the end of my rope and fearing the worst.",

But they've become constant, basically an every day occurrence since march of this year. Back in April i was given Hydroxyzine as needed for the panic attacks, and have also been put on buspirone 5mg 3 times a day. I have also been put on a beta blocker as well to help prevent the more severe symptoms of the panic attacks. Unfortunately, i still have panic attcks. The beta blocker definitely does its job but unfortunately it won't prevent the impending doom/fight or flight feeling from happening. My doctor gave me zoloft and told me i could chose to start it along side my other medications if i felt i needed to, or i could just stick to what im already doing. Im debating on if i should try starting the zoloft, or if i should just try upping the dosage on my buspirone first. Im absolutely terrified of side effects and im afraid that any possible side effects from the zoloft will send me into a whirlwind of panic attacks. It already took everything i had to start the medications im already taking (because i couldn't take it anymore and was incredibly desperate), and im also terrified of serotonin syndrome. ",

The way my body reactions and responds to things always felt impulsive and pre programmed. \n\nBut the for the last few years, and recently every day for the last six months I think I might be in a coma. When I'm sleeping, and I know I'm definitely asleep, someone shines like this super bright torch behind my eyes. It's so bright even with my eyes closed, and wakes me up. When I go to open my eyes I'm squinting them because the light is so bright. But when I open my eyes, it's just darkness.\n\nI also have these episodes where doctors have told be they are absent seziures and neurological glitches due to trauma. But I have these moments like my brain switches off, I can't see anything, I'm not aware of anything, and then I come back to the room and have had no idea what's going on. To me it feels like the bright light is a doctor checking my eyes for vital signs or something in a coma. I'm definitely not medically trained so that might not be correct. But I feel when I leave in my head during this moments, it's my heart that's stopped beating in the coma or somethings gone wrong with my real body.\n\nThe body I am in too feels wrong. Not like body dysmorphia. But it does look or feel right. None of my joints feel in the correct spot, the skin is way to smooth all over like it's not real, when i bruise or get cut it's look like it's been hand drawn.\n\nI've tried explaining this to my husband and friends but they think I'm mad. But two days, I completely forgot how to talk. Nothing was coming out. I could understand, but couldn't speak, all my words were jumbled up and nothing was coherent. I thought I was having a stroke, but no other symptoms then the aphasia. Like someone had switched to a different language in a computer game. It was so scary but weird. I know this probably all sounds crazy, and maybe I am. But I just feel like I'm not really me. \n\nI don't know what I'm wanting from this post, maybe someone to listen or try and understand. And maybe I am insane, but what better way to voice your crazy conspiracy theories to strangers on the Internet. Thanks in advance. ",

      "selftext": "My diagnosis was only a week ago and my normal anxiety just went berserk. I had to see two new doctors (new primary care doctor and new oncologist) and of course they wanted me to fill out the paperwork for new patients (thankfully PCS was online which was easier). But the forms at the cancer center were numerous. I already have terrible handwriting and just the idea of me making mistakes for something so important just gave me even more anxiety.\n\n Thankfully my new primary care doctor was like an angel. I was in unbelievable pain and she made sure to take care of that. I also told her about my severe anxiety and she prescribed Clonazepam. I had been prescribed Valium and Xanax before and they really didn‚Äôt do all that much and certainly didn‚Äôt last long. \n\nBut less than an hour after taking the single small clonazepam pill. I started to get a relaxed feeling. Nothing like getting a high, just more like feeling what normal people must feel like. After a little while I decided to fill out the paperwork for my oncologist who I would see the next day. I think I was able to write neater and smaller which is needed in those forms, than ever before in my life. And I didn‚Äôt stress about it.\n\nI know this might sound like a small thing but with what I‚Äôm going through it was huge. And it‚Äôs not just writing on a form. It made me drive without constantly jerking my head because I thought I saw something. Again, I was not impaired. If anything I had a much clear head to drive than usual. \n\nI hope I get through this cancer. And I hope when I do I can continue with the Clonazepam. I‚Äôm not even sure I would‚Äôve gone to my oncology appointment if it wasn‚Äôt for it. \n",

I would have years of remission and years of relapse. \n\nThis year was particularly bad, especially dealing with post partum and finishing up my associate's degree. I have tried exercise, healthy eating, hydration - and still suffered with daily panic attacks since this July. I had a really bad experience with weed that developed  into DPRR back in 2021 and the doctors gave me Lexapro which exasperated my symptoms and made me have thoughts of killing myself. I showed up to the hospital with a heart reading of 192/200 BPM. I swore off SSRIs after that experience.\n\nI thought supplements could be the end all he all and exercise and a low carb diet would fix me - but needless to say it didn't. I just started taking 12.5 mg of Zoloft last week and I'm already seeing significant improvement. I haven't had a lot of deja vu, or morning routine panic attacks - and if you're caught up on my story you know that I was beginning  to suspect TLE (temporal lobe epilepsy)because of the symptoms I was having. I'm still considering a brain MRI just to be on the safe side, but I'm actually convinced I just had really bad disassociation and morning panic attacks made me feel like I was stuck in a dream state. I feel like it's too early to say anything quiet yet - especially since it hasn't even been a month yet, but setraline has bought me some relief. The side effects have resided - the only thing that I deal with is being lethargic - so I started taking the medicine at night. Sleep was one of the main things I was struggling with so this isn't an issue for me - I do not mind the Zoloft making me drowsy because I'd rather be drowsy and calm than wired and anxious. ",

My anxiety has been so bad that I‚Äôve experienced depersonalization/derealization during panic attacks and I had to be hospitalized in July.\n\nI‚Äôm now on medication (lexapro and hydroxyzine) and attend group therapy to help me unpack the trauma and pain that led me to my mental breakdown and decline.\n\nToday was the first time in A LONG TIME that I drove and the first time since JUNE that I‚Äôve drove in the car BY MYSELF!!!!! I dropped my grandma off at the local community center which is only 2-3 minutes from us. In the same plaza as the community center, there‚Äôs a beauty supply store and I was able to drive there and purchase some items.\n\nJust as I was about to go home because the Marshalls in the same plaza wasn‚Äôt open yet, I remembered that the new H-Mart that opened in my area wasn‚Äôt that far and it was only a three minute drive from the plaza. I‚Äôve been wanting to go since before it even opened and I was determined to buy some tasty snacks. So I buckled up, breathed and mustered up the courage to drive there. Since it just opened up, there‚Äôs usually a long line that you have to wait but I was able to walk right in!! I was so happy getting all the yummy food I wanted and being able to feel like a normal person again shopping by myself for the first time in months. \n\nNow, to be honest, I was scared shitless on the inside the entire time I was driving (regardless of the amount of time or close distances I was driving). It was still scary but I was determined to do it. I had faith that I could do it and I was tired of anxiety ruling my life, making me feel like all I could do was rot at home. I think medication has helped me immensely so that I can quiet the negative noise in my mind. I‚Äôm hoping that this little win (major win for me) will help me to feel comfortable driving again and more often.\n\nI know this was super long but I‚Äôm hoping this will uplift someone! Your anxiety is lying to you and you can do whatever you set your mind to, no matter how big or small the goal! ü´∂üèæ",

      "selftext": "Hi all, thanks for tuning in.\n\nI‚Äôm 27F and I‚Äôve never had a romantic relationship. I could never put a finger on why is that, so I struggle to find a core issue. But at this point in my life I`m desperate for a change. \n\nMy best guess on why this is - is my struggle with anxiety around dating and sex. Every time I develop an interest in a guy or try to pursue something, my mind races with fears and doubts. I end up canceling plans, or when I do go through with it, I feel like adrenalin is pumping to the max and I‚Äôm faking my every move to avoid embarrassing myself plus keep the other person entertained.\n\nMen are not fools, so of course they end up reading my avoidance as me being uninterested and move on. Which I inevitably categorize as \"good for them, they dodged a bullet\", although logically I have things going for me like successful career, decent looks, reasonable intelligence.\n\nThe main thing I struggle with is the anxiety I get around sex. I worry that I won‚Äôt enjoy it, or that my partner won‚Äôt either. This fear paralyzes me from making any real progress in relationships, because I understand that this is where every relationship is going eventually, but the pressure of it (pressure that I put on myself) kills any drive I had. Also, I‚Äôve found that I‚Äôm really uncomfortable being vulnerable with someone new, which leads me to push people away before I get too close. Once I start feeling those nerves, I end up avoiding them or making excuses to cancel plans. It feels like a never-ending cycle of self-sabotage, and I hate myself for it.\n\nI know I need to make changes, but I have no idea where to start. I`ve tried pushing through the dates and only ended up leading people on, I`ve fixed the unhealthy relationship I used to have with porn - quit it altogether, I`ve tried dating apps (got instantly shadow banned - zero matches), I`ve gone to multiple therapists to no avail, I`ve tried naturally meeting people by putting myself into new social circles. \n\nIn the end, I`ve only ended up falling deeper into anxiety, leading to an anxiety disorder diagnosis and meds (which do help, but are not magic). \n\nI‚Äôm looking for advice (especially the brutally honest kind) on how to break out of this cycle. If you've dealt with similar anxiety or have any tips on building confidence in relationships, I would really appreciate it. Also, if you think I'm just making excuses, please tell me. I need to hear it.\n\nTL;DR: 27F, never had a relationship due to anxiety around dating and sex. I constantly cancel plans, push people away, and sabotage myself. I‚Äôve tried therapy, dating apps, and self-help but still can‚Äôt break the cycle. Any brutally honest advice on how to stop self-sabotaging and build confidence would be appreciated.",

I know mentally that im not going to per say but my body just freaks out. Ive had my head and heart checked multiple times and i AM OKAY. I just start thinking what if they miss something, or what if its something different. \n\nRecently i went to the er for a headache where they gave me benedryl and compazine. I had a HORRIBLE reaction to the compazine. Since then my anxiety has been through the roof. Feeling anxious, dizzy, shaky on and off, headaches, numb, nauseous, and that i am going to die/internal doom. I just dont feel like myself. \n\n\nI went to the doctor again yesterday and we have decided i should try Lexapro(nervous as fuck to even try it.) That being said id rather try something than be stuck in this state of anxiety. She prescribed me 10mg but this morning i cut it in half and took only 5mg. It seemed to work pretty quick and i actually thought i was back to normal(even though i know its the first day) i was helping my mom with some yard work to keep busy and my mind off it. Then i started to get a little dizzy, nauseous, stomach ache, and feel the anxiety creeping up. \n\nI guess i just wanna know if anyone else has experienced the same thing? I know its only the first day and it probably wont help instantly, and i read here that the first week is usually rough. Im just so over feeling like this and feel hopeless. \n\nSorry for going on and on about this.",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone,\nA few days ago, my sister had a strange kind of attack where she would suddenly faint out of nowhere and then come back to normal within 15 to 30 seconds, often screaming or crying when she woke up. This cycle repeated almost 50 times over the span of about 5 hours. The rest of the time, she was completely normal  both before and after the episodes.\n\nThis happened during the festival season, so most of the expert doctors were on leave. We rushed her to the emergency room, did all the basic tests (ECG, blood pressure, etc.), and everything came back normal.\n\nAfter the festival, we took her to the hospital again, and she was admitted for 3 days. Every possible test was done, but everything was still normal. The doctors said it might be anxiety with dissociative disorder. During one of the attacks, she even refused to recognize her husband, father-in-law, and brother-in-law.\n\nWhen the doctors asked about her childhood, she mentioned some traumatic experiences  like being falsely accused of stealing things from her aunt‚Äôs house and getting scolded for things she didn‚Äôt do, among other similar incidents.\n\nNow she‚Äôs at home resting. She‚Äôs normal most of the time, but whenever something reminds her of her childhood home (not her married home), she gets those attacks again. Even seeing the bag we sent her with things from that house made her faint.\n\nIf two people around her start talking about even small stressful topics, she can faint again. When I went to visit her, she just looked at me, fainted, and was unconscious for about 5 to 10 seconds. When she woke up, she started crying uncontrollably. After that, I came back home.",

No one will really see you.\nAnd if they see you? No one will care.\nAnd if they care? No one will remember.\nAnd if they remember? It won‚Äôt kill you!\n\nDuring my first years in university, I used to get intense panic attacks whenever my name appeared on the presentation schedule. I couldn‚Äôt sleep, I felt scared and anxious, stomach pain, extreme tension ‚Äî and all that started four weeks before the presentation! Can you imagine?\n\nI always tried to avoid it. The first time, I said I was sick and didn‚Äôt attend. The next time, I said I was traveling. The next, another excuse.\nBut every time I made an excuse, something inside me broke. It only made things worse. My confidence kept dropping, and I felt more like a failure each time.\n\nUntil the new academic year (my fourth year), I made a different decision.\nI decided not to attend the presentation ‚Äî with no excuses.\nThat‚Äôs it. There‚Äôs a presentation I‚Äôm supposed to give? I just won‚Äôt do it.\nGrades? I‚Äôll give them up. Simple as that.\n\nMy mental health improved a lot after that. Month by month, I felt my confidence return. The panic attacks, fear, and depression disappeared ‚Äî because I was finally honest with myself. Everyone has strengths and weaknesses, and my weakness was public speaking. So why torture myself over it? I just continued my life without it.\n\nOver time, I noticed I was actually getting better. I became more social.\nAnd I also want to say something important: you need commitment ‚Äî find something to stay consistent with.\n\nFor me, I committed to quitting porn (though I still masturbate sometimes, just without porn).\nI committed to not eating fast food.\nI committed to sleeping at the same time every day.\nI committed to using my stationary bike in my room.\nI committed to studying two lectures every day, with weekends for rest, relaxation, and seeing people.\n\nNow I feel like I have value.\nMy voice is heard, my opinions matter, and my presence feels different.\n\nI can simply say:\nEverything ‚Äúright‚Äù you do increases your confidence.\nAnd everything ‚Äúwrong‚Äù you do decreases it.\n",

My wife and I were discussing some potential changes she wanted to make to her job, that really wouldn't even effect our income....and BOOM...that was the final trigger. So here we go again.\n\nI started the paxil again (10mg) and I'm on day four. At this point my extreme morning anxiety is like....almost familiar enough to be comfortable with after a few hours...lol. Not really but I'm sure many of you understand. Anyway......it's pretty bad this morning so I messaged my doc for the clonazepam....I hate having to do that but I know the paxil works for me and the wheels didn't start coming off until I stopped it entirely, and I know it's common to get jumpy when you reintroduce yourself to these drugs. Yes, I had a few depressive episodes over the course of about 8 years, but those were due to normal life stressors and I was able to gather myself pretty quickly and work it out. \n\nAlso I gained weight when I started taking Paxil, HOWEVER....I was approaching my mid 30s and enjoyed taco bell a little too much.

I breathe fine when I sleep as well. The moment I think about it I just suddenly feel as if I‚Äôm not getting enough oxygen and need to take deep breaths to the point it‚Äôs starting to hurt. I have to sit here and check myself to make sure I‚Äôm not breathing TOO hard and remind myself that I am ok, but in the effort to do that I‚Äôm reminding myself of the problem in the first place and I‚Äôm struggling to find a way out of this cycle.\nAny tips?",

I joined an expensive coaching already 5 months later than one is supposed to. So while everyone has laready made friends and is comfortable with the teachers, I am a little awkward. I feel that everyone probably judges me. I am not pretty, I have acne and I laugh too loud, speak too much. Sometimes teachers make lighthearted jokes and I feel embarrassed.\n\nA tiny incident happened today, I left a notebook and my id at my class and now I am embarrassed that someone is going to find it and make fun of my photo. The teachers will probably think of me as irresponsible and childish besides being meek. I know it's irrational but I can't help thinking about it over and over. Please help",

      "selftext": "Hello!\n\nAfter rolling with the punches for my whole life I decided to take some steps to alleviate my anxiety, and I've noticed a pattern.\n\nI primarily function on what I call \"task mode\", where I focus entirely on a single activity or task, in order to escape my worries. This \"\"\"works\"\"\" in that it distracts me, but it simultaneously makes me lose my grounding e.g., I act unconsciously to complete my objective, and do not take in any of my surroundings. This overall negatively impacts how I feel.\n\nI was just curious as to whether anyone else goes through is, and what techniques I could try to avoid or manage it.\n\nSo far I've mostly worked on this by stopping what I'm doing and running through the 54321's, and focusing on breathing, but those techniques aren't always that effective.\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts!",

I have already been beating myself up and tormenting myself over this and I know its wrong.\n\nBasically I work alot and I have genuinely been feeling ill and burntout. I usually work 7-8 days in a row and I never have time for anything due to my schedule changing from nights to days to mornings etc and being so exhausted.\n\nThere was a work party I had work the next day but I decided to leave early so that way I could enjoy myself and still make it in.\n\nNeedless to say I was not okay in the morning. Hangxiety, hangover and feeling so uncomfortable and unwell led to me to call in sick. \n\nMy manager angrily says she knows I went out the night before after i said i was ill. \nI am actually so embarrassed and ashamed I shouldn't of gone out but i kept missing every other outing and I really wanted to just have fun.\n\nI feel stupid and maybe I should of toughed it out or not went out.\n\nMy management is quite mean and I'm scared about whats going to happen when i go back in. \n\nI also made one of my coworkers mad as i didnt realise she needed help that day as it was just her in her department. (we are in different departments but sometimes i help her when i can).\n\nI really just need advice on how to handle this situation and anxiety. My anxiety gets the better of me and id rather just quit then face it (although not even a choice as i need the job) Any advice? \n\nAlso side note I never call in sick this is my first time calling in. The only other time I had a day off was going home early due to a panic attack.",

      "selftext": "I have been unable to sleep at night for two entire days because of anxiety. Each time I shut my eyes and can feel myself beginning to relax, a stream of adrenaline rises within me, as if my body has learnt to associate that state between consciousness and sleep with danger. I'm writing this while preparing for my third night, and I dread going upstairs to lay down because I just remember the past two nights, where every semi-relaxed moment was pursued by a surge of anxiety, as though my own body was vying to punish me. Breathing exercises, mental mantras, magnesium supplements, and light exercise during the day have been contaminated with these feelings. My mind instantly jumps to the image of them not working, which spikes the anxiety and causes me to become agitated, and ultimately sleepless. This awful cycle is solidified by the anxiety attached to being able to sleep, as well as the need to sleep. \n\n  \nI want a simple remedy to find me quickly. But I feel abandoned in my options. My parents just tell me to do more exercise, and while I've tried to do light exercise for the past two nights, I don't do that much because I don't want to hurt myself. \n\n  \nIf you're curious about a potential trigger for this, I'm quite sure it all began due to a panic attack I had two days ago. I was walking upstairs to use the restroom, and I began to check my pulse, which I noticed was high. Thinking I was having a serious medical issue, a wave of panic overcame me, raising my heart rate even further and thereby locking me in a state of extreme worry. While this episode was short-lived, that night was the first in which I've been unable to sleep at all. ",

      "selftext": "My body keeps hitting the siren for no reason. Heart jumps. Chest feels loud. Hands go cold. Brain screams this is the moment. I do the hospital shuffle. Wires. Blood. Machines. All fine. Great news and somehow my head still thinks it is the end. The symptoms feel real while the papers say I am okay. That mismatch fries me. Nights are the worst. Early mornings too. I open my eyes and the scanner in my brain turns on. Every twitch gets a spotlight. After an episode I feel wrung out. Then I wait for the next one like a storm you can hear but not see.\n\nI try little things. Slow exhale counting. An ice pack on my chest or neck. A lap around the block. Less coffee. No doom googling. Text a friend and say I am safe and this will pass. Sometimes it helps. Sometimes it just keeps me afloat.\n\nIf you get the same false alarms with clean tests how do you ride it out. Do you anchor on a phrase. Do you put a song on repeat. Sit up. Lie down. Stare at a clock for ten minutes. Let it wash over you. Trip it up early. What actually made the episodes smaller for you. \n\nIf you are in it too I hope we both get a string of boring calm days soon.",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone, I have a lot to say but I‚Äôll try my best to keep it short. The past few years I have had rapture anxiety. But these last few weeks, this past month, it has gotten so much worse. There was part of me that knew not to believe that South African pastor and his rapture date, but it still scared me so bad. And now that the date was changed to October 6-8 it scared me even more, even though I knew they were wrong the first time they would be wrong this time. But the topic still scares me so much. Not just the thought of me or my family  ‚Äúbeing left behind‚Äù, it‚Äôs that I‚Äôm so young. I‚Äôm 16 years old, there‚Äôs much I want to do and accomplish. Although some might argue I shouldn‚Äôt be focusing on this life and the worldly things,but focus on the afterlife, I can‚Äôt help myself but to have goals for myself. I keep hearing different things, pre tribulation beliefs, mid or post trib. So many people saying the rapture will happen on this year or that year or it will happen within the next 1-10 years. It‚Äôs scary! It might sound childish and stupid but it really does make a huge impact on me. I recently deleted TikTok because that was the main source of the things I would hear. But yesterday, I spent the ENTIRE DAY, from the moment i got up to before I went to bed early in the morning, just researching anything and everything revolving end times.It was so exhausting and tiring and extremely anxiety inducing! I couldn‚Äôt help myself though. Maybe it had something to do with my ocd. But I genuinely couldn‚Äôt do my schoolwork or go to bed or do anything in peace without having to research something. Even if I had to research the same questions over. And over. And over. And over. And over again.I heard many different things that contradicted each other. I felt so much fear, even today I have so much anxiety, as much as I try to pray it away. Even if these rapture dates are wrong, just the thought of it happening any day or a post tribulation is scary to me. I‚Äôm trying not to make this too long, if I were to explain all my worries I would‚Äôve already written a whole book. But I want to know, are there people who have overcome rapture anxiety? I‚Äôm planning on going to therapy for it soon, but I want to know if there is anyone who has overcome rapture anxiety without changing their christian belief. I can‚Äôt take this anxiety any more, I feel like I‚Äôm going mad and that I‚Äôm going insane. I have no appetite and I can‚Äôt even eat. I now this sounds silly but I genuinely am not able to enjoy everyday it‚Äôs consuming me and it‚Äôs getting too much. Thank you for hearing me out. God bless you.",

We're in LA so there will be a lot of people, we'll be there super early. \n\nTMI but I've been dealing with a lot of anxiety-induced urges to pee (not UTI), even when I don't actually have to. I then get so scared that I'll pee myself, causing more anxiety and more urges. I'm so scared of feeling smushed at the barricade and also having to go to the bathroom and leave my friend behind, because I'm too nervous to push my way through the crowd to get back to her. I'm just nervous overall.\n\nI don't feel like I should push back on her wanting to be in the front, because she paid for her ticket and only wanted to go if we got to be in GA so she could be close. I also know I should've considered this when I bought the tickets and decided to go, but I wasn't dealing with the pee anxiety as much when we decided. I'm half venting and half looking for advice on any tips for being at barricade when suffering from anxiety :\\^) Thank you if you read all this! <3",

We used to be inseparable ‚Äî texting every day, spending hours together, knowing every little detail about each other‚Äôs lives. Somewhere along the way, things started to shift.

We both knew what we were to each other, even if we never gave it an official label.\n\nThen a while ago, she asked for space. She said she still loved and cared for me but just needed time for herself. I respected that, even though it really hurt. I tried to give her what she asked for ‚Äî to stop overthinking, to not text her constantly, to just focus on myself and trust that she‚Äôd come back like she said she would.\n\nBut now it feels like I‚Äôm the only one she‚Äôs avoiding. She talks to the rest of our friend group normally, but with me, it‚Äôs cold and distant. Today I found out she told everyone in the group that she wasn‚Äôt coming to class ‚Äî everyone except me. And that really hit me, because usually, if one of us wasn‚Äôt going to show up, we‚Äôd always text each other. It was our thing.\n\nI don‚Äôt know why she couldn‚Äôt just tell me like she told the others. It‚Äôs not about attendance ‚Äî it‚Äôs about what it means.

      "selftext": "Hi everyone! In recent years, I‚Äôve had a lot of anxiety about moving. I didn‚Äôt feel this way a few years back, but I feel like I‚Äôve become my aware of my noise sensitivity in the past 4/5 years. I had a really bad apartment experience where the walls were paper thin, I was so close to a busy street (not very high up) and ended up getting out of that lease.\n\nWhen I left that place, I moved to my current spot and have been living here for three years. That‚Äôs the longest I‚Äôve ever lived somewhere, and at first I was not the biggest fan but I got used to the noises, quirks etc. Funny enough, I slept every night with headphones or earplugs bc of my anxiety and how loud the AC was. Once I met my bf, I started sleeping without and I got used to it.\n\nIt has come with plenty of issues, like the AC breaking frequently, ‚Äúmandating‚Äù certain silly rules, management issues, no laundry in unit and recently someone broke into my unit. All these things happened that made me feel it was the right choice to move, especially since my bf and I are now living together. \n\nBut as I‚Äôve been packing things in boxes, I feel really sad. I‚Äôve lived so much of my life in this unit and it‚Äôs become home to me. I was freaking out if I made the right choice. I think the hardest part is leaving my section of the neighborhood. For context, I‚Äôm moving to a high rise corner unit on the top floor. I visited multiple times and it seemed quiet, the main difference is I‚Äôm going from being deep in the neighborhood to being more so on the outside of it and the building is on one of our main streets going into my current neighborhood. My unit doesn‚Äôt face it directly, so the noise is pretty good it seems. But I‚Äôm going to not pass the same townhomes and the same parks, even though I‚Äôll be in the same neighborhood. I just want to know I made the right choice and that everything will be okay. \n\nA positive thing too is the lease is until June, so it‚Äôs not a super long lease so I suppose if I missed an apartment like the one I‚Äôm moving out of, we could just move back to one similar. Anyway, thank you if you made it this far and read all this! Would appreciate any advice / two cents. Thank you :)\n\nTLDR ‚Äî how do you go about adjusting when you‚Äôre saying goodbye to a place you‚Äôve known as home and the uncertainty that comes with a new spot?",

      "selftext": "I‚Äôm 21 and I feel like I‚Äôm spoiling life for myself. This August, I finally escaped my abusive home life. I now live with my girlfriend and our three pets. I should be the happiest I‚Äôve ever been because I didn‚Äôt just escape one abusive situation, but two. Here‚Äôs my problem. \n\nIn middle school and high school, I regularly bottled up my emotions for the sake of my mother‚Äôs. She was getting verbally and emotionally abused by her clinically diagnosed narcissist and alcoholic boyfriend. I watched it from beginning to end and as I was unable to separate myself from the situation, I decided to become her tiny therapist. Therefore, from that moment on, I bottled up my feelings so that I was not another burden in my mother‚Äôs life.\n\nSometime before I graduated high school, the boyfriend and my mother broke up and she met another man worse beyond imagination. Before we knew it, we were in an even worse, more terrible situation and something in me just broke. I no longer could hide much less bottle up my emotions and while I lived with my mom and her new husband, I would break down over anything and everything. If I wasn‚Äôt working, I was probably anxious and crying in my room or trying to distract myself from how anxious I was. \n\nI thought removing myself from that house would remove at least, the majority of that anxiety I experienced on the daily. I‚Äôm in the first safe situation of my LIFE and here I am, still weeping from my PTSD. \n\nI know I cry a lot. Nobody in my life lets me forget that. They act like I‚Äôm just wallowing in my tears, but they don‚Äôt see the flashbacks I get during random moments of the day or the screams I hear in my head or the terrible things this man said about me to me. I constantly have to repeat ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre safe‚Äù to myself like a mantra. I don‚Äôt want to be weepy, I don‚Äôt want to cry at the drop of a hat, but I don‚Äôt know anymore how to keep my emotions at bay. All of my hobbies are calming, but if I‚Äôm deep in an anxiety attack, my mind can‚Äôt focus on them. I don‚Äôt know what to do. ",

      "selftext": "So as a bit of background context, me and my girlfriend have been dating for just under 4 months, and we‚Äôre about a month and a half into a long-distance relationship for our first year of uni. Before that during summer we could only see each other once a week. Right after Thanksgiving weekend, so in like a week, we‚Äôre getting together, and we both couldn‚Äôt be more excited. But right now we have to get through midterms, and we both have a few left. Now onto my horrible anxiety. \n\nToday I brought up the idea of us both FaceTiming while we study, and we‚Äôll make sure to not talk while we study, and she seemed to really wanna do it. About an hour ago, she got home from studying at a library, she had a shower and got comfy and everything, but said she really needed to focus on studying and she‚Äôd get distracted, and to be fair she totally would. But that sent me into feeling depressed, devastated, anxious, and gave me a horrible headache and made me cry. I sent the most composed messages I could, and then went off to cry and eventually I took to the shower.\n\nHere in the shower, where I‚Äôm still writing this, I cried some more, but then searched something up on my phone cause I was curious. I know don‚Äôt take medical advice from random websites, but something matched up painfully well to how I was acting for months. I went from horribly depressed to immediately a numb, emotionless neutral as I thought about my whole life and how I acted in any social situation. Then I changed to happy, like genuinely happy, smiling even. I realized that these 4 months, and especially the last month, have been so messed up for a reason. It‚Äôs an answer I feel even more confident to over my social anxiety. I feel like you might be able to guess what‚Äôs been screwing my social life over for my whole life.\n\nSeparation anxiety. \n\nEverything made sense, and it wasn‚Äôt just me. I‚Äôve had multiple times where I‚Äôm on a call with her and someone drags her away, and I think it‚Äôs gonna be a few minutes, but it turning into an hour or two, and leaves me crying into a pillow with the worst anxiety and texting her every 5-10 minutes wondering if she‚Äôs okay and if she wants to talk. I will go from depressed and anxious into emotional numbness, where I feel nothing, until she properly texts back and I go back to feeling normal. Every day we need to message every hour, and if we don‚Äôt I‚Äôll have a mini anxiety attack internally, until she sends something and I feel relieved. I love loving her and having her attention, but I hate this, especially in a long distance relationship.\n\nI wanna say she is the most kind and caring person I know, she never does anything like that purpose, and the fact that I need to clarify that shows how messed up I am with separation. She doesn‚Äôt realize or know about any of this, she‚Äôs only commented on how she‚Äôs surprised but loves how much I text her, and apologizes for not being able to do that same where I then have to reassure her that I‚Äôm weird that I can do this and that how much she does is plenty, cause before I even recognized that. If any of what I said paints her in a bad picture, it‚Äôs cause I worded it wrong, she is an angel, and anyone can say that, not just me. You can‚Äôt dislike her, she has no one that even remotely does. \n\nAlso sorry if my account seems suspicious, it‚Äôs one I never used and is kinda throwaway rn.",

But, here‚Äôs where my issue comes into play:\n\nI am constantly anxious that I‚Äôm going to throw up in public. It has happened, it wasn‚Äôt good. I have a constant fear of vomiting in public to the point I can‚Äôt think or exist in a social situation without being overwhelmed with the fear that I might just need to vomit.\n\nI don‚Äôt want advice on how to stop the vomiting, I just want to know if this is just a new thing I‚Äôve developed anxiety over, or if this counts as emetophobia? Which I guess doesn‚Äôt have to exist outside of the realm of anxiety, I don‚Äôt know. What does it sound like? I‚Äôve met emetophobes before and they‚Äôre afraid of throwing up under any circumstance, but I‚Äôm okay if it happens in private.\n\nYeah, I don‚Äôt really know what to say!!!!!",

      "selftext": "Zoloft does not help. Wellbutrin helps a little, but my baseline anxiety is so extreme. I keep subconsciously accepting that my life will just be full of anxiety and suffering because of said anxiety. My anxiety is what makes me depressed. My depression has been so bad and my motivation and hope has been hanging on by a thread.\n\nI feel like my social and general anxiety are really bad, but the social anxiety kills me. I have a presentation coming up and have been procrastinating writing it because every time I try to I spiral in anxiety and then can't concentrate at all. Then the longer I put off writing it, the larger the dread builds and it makes it even more difficult. I feel like I'm constantly in high alert/fight or flight.\n\nToday it got so bad I took Lorazepram that I've had in my cupboard for years from a surgery. It's not even been an hour and I feel my body calming down. This is what I want, but not a benzo. Something I can take every day or frequently over a long period to force y body to no longer be anxious. I don't even think anxious thoughts half the time, its just my body and my heart rate going up to 150+. I did a presentation with an apple watch on and it got up to nearly 180bpm.\n\nAnyways, I need help. And my current meds are not helping this. Does anyone have success from Inderal or other similar drugs that can be taken long term and don't completely ruin concentration/focus/memory?\n\nThank you for any thoughts shared",

      "selftext": "I was diagnosed with MDD + anxious distress last June after having my first ever panic attacks and GERD. I thought for sure I had cancer or something else that's serious. I tried medication, stopped, but had a relapse after a month. Went back to my old meds but my doc put me on sertraline. After 2 days, I woke up feeling so off that I truly believed I was gonna die, and be stuck in this hell forever. I feel I had DPDR. I decided to stop meds. For a good 3 weeks, I slowly recovered. DPDR was gone, still had morning anxiety but flipped off like a switch when I taught my classes. However, every weekend, I would have crazy amounts of anxiety and fear--since it always creeped up when I wasn't at school. The worst was last weekend where I couldn't get out of my head. I was so afraid of my situation, that I wouldn't get back to normal. I fell on my knees, and was in a fetal position. Took a week long break from work. Wild anxiety happens everyday. I fear going into a state where i can't control my emotions, and that i would hurt my loved ones. I'm so afraid that I might be going into psychosis or schizophrenia. :( Im back on my meds now and a bit more stable but still the fear is within. :( \n\nEdit: has anyone ever experienced something like this and recovered?",

The thing is, in taking this to be able to do stuff that stresses me out a lot like social √©vents or apointments but i dont know if ill be able to at all.

I don‚Äôt know how to tell her I‚Äôm not going to take it because I am bad at that because of my social issues. Does anyone have advice for me or experience with Zoloft? Do you think not taking it and just doing talk therapy and the Hydroxyzine would work? She said talk therapy would be for my mind and thoughts while the Zoloft is for my ‚Äúlevels‚Äù to balance because of my depression and anxiety. Every time I get prescribed an SSRI I don‚Äôt take it and panic and it makes me so unsettled to even think about after everything I‚Äôve heard. I‚Äôm terrified to have it not work for me and stop it and get brain zaps as well. I don‚Äôt want to feel numb, have low libido, and all of that stuff",

      "selftext": "\nHey everyone,\n\nI‚Äôve been on 50mg of Pristiq for about a month now for anxiety, but I‚Äôm not really noticing much improvement. At first I thought it might be starting to help; had a few better days early on, but lately my anxiety has come back full force.\n\nFor background, I was on Lexapro for about 5 years and it worked really well until it eventually pooped out. My psychiatrist switched me to Pristiq, but so far it hasn‚Äôt done much.\n\nI know Pristiq is basically the active metabolite of Effexor, but I‚Äôve read mixed things about which one works better for anxiety. For anyone who‚Äôs tried both, did Effexor end up working better for you, or were they about the same?\n\nJust trying to figure out if it‚Äôs worth sticking it out longer or bringing up a switch with my psychiatrist.\n\nWould really appreciate hearing your experiences, thanks.\n",

Every convo i have, im awkward, overthinking, i cant even make eye contact, my voice is shaky. And then I dont even know how to contribute a lot of the times, and i end up saying the most dumb shit thing ever, and i can tell when the person im talking to would rather be doing anything else than talk to me. Because of that any person i meet its like i become an interviewer. It makes me feel broken and as if im learning how to become human. Now i end up avoiding places and situations that require me to initiate a interaction.  \n\nIts gotten so bad, that its even worse with family. I use to be so comfortable around them and could talk to them, and now that im older, more is expected of me that it seems my brain goes into a shutdown mode around them. It makes me sad cause i do love my family and im afraid im ruining relationships because i avoid talking to them. The worse feeling is when i cant speak to my grandpa anymore. I love my grandpa like no other, he was always there for me and my siblings, he use to pick me up from school when he didnt have to, was literally my santa for every christmas, hes the one who got me into art and baseball among other things. And overtime for some reason i cant spark a single convo around him and its so awkward. I come visit him, do a simple how are you, and then dont say nothing. He has to be the one to ask me questions and i give him the most vague answers. Because i dont know what to say or talk about. This makes me depressed, cause hes 79 and if anything happens, im gonna regret not having one good and wholesome convo with him. That'll eat me up inside. Its like my mind is literal rot when comes to social interactions. Its ruining my ability to make friends, getting into a relationship and just enjoying my young life. Its like im wasitng my youth.",

I‚Äôve also been struggling with my health (dysphasia likely linked to my anxiety which means I‚Äôve not had a proper meal since July which‚Ä¶doesn‚Äôt help..)\n\nBut I don‚Äôt rest. I don‚Äôt relax, I don‚Äôt get hungry, I just feel like I‚Äôm fighting to get through each week so I can sleep as much as I want on the weekends. I‚Äôd love to be going out and doing more but my body and mind are just screaming please let me rest I‚Äôm so tired.\n\nI‚Äôve tried doing lists of to-do stuff, I‚Äôve tried listening to my body and just going to sleep after work if I need to, I‚Äôve tried implementing routines which only ever last a couple of months as I get more and more tired until I end up asleep at 6pm, I‚Äôve tried scheduling fun things during the week tj break things up but I feel like I‚Äôm only half there \n\nAnd then I realistically DO make mistakes at work with the problems I‚Äôm having concentrating which gets me in a bit of a spiral. \n\nHow are people managing this? I‚Äôm 28, other than the eating difficulties which will affect my energy levels more than usual, my blood tests show everything is normal so I don‚Äôt know how to deal with this",
