      "selftext": "I'm an average looking guy, but struggled with girls because I was afraid of rejection. I recently had a reunion with some buddies from my early twenties, and it was a great, therapeutic weekend. Of course, we had fun, but we had some conversations about the things we did when we were younger.\n\n  \nI told the guys I had a crush on a cute girl, and how I never pursued her, and I wouldn't even admit I would like to date her. As I thought about why that was, is I was afraid of looking stupid for even conceiving to go out with her. Like she would hear about it and cruelly reject me. I guess I'm a sensitive soul.\n\nI figured that I'm not the only one who's ever felt that way, and I know 'just get over that fear' doesn't really help, but I think had I identified that unrealistic scenario, I would've been more likely to at least admit that I think she's cute, and maybe work my way up to asking for a low-threat hangout date. \n\nI'm married now and not upset that I didn't get that girl and don't pine over her, I just hate that I was that insecure. While she may not have been interested (I'm cool with that), I shouldn't have been so scared.\n\nI think it's a show of strength if you can say 'yeah, you're cute and I'd like to take you out.'  And people like people who can be honest.\n\nAnyway, that was surprisingly mind blowing to remember how much I feared rejection and I really hope somebody can benefit from my experience.",

      "selftext": "Modern life can be daunting. Everything is fast. Everything is computer. Here are 5 ways to get rid' of overwhelm.\n\n1. Take apart big tasks  \nThe most overwhelming thing for many of us is, when we stand in front of a new challenge and simply by looking at it we feel like it's time to open a new chocolate bar. Yet, often it's already enough to ask \"what is the next step?\" or just breaking down everything into chunks.\n\n2. Write down EVERYTHING  \nThe more we think we can keep in our mind, the more our brain's working memory has to carry all of that information. It's simply not necessary and always adds unnecessary stress. You can either buy a simple small notebook where you write down things and check them when they're done or you write them into your mobile devices. I personally write everything into the default notetaking app of my tablet with a widget on the mainscreen. When it's done, it gets erased. \n\n3. Execute immediately  \nAny task that can be done within a minute - execute immediately. Rescheduling, payments, a call, a quick research, a decision. Mastering immediate execution is a fascinating skill and will give you a huge confidence boost once you notice how much time others waste by piling up one due decision after another.\n\n4. Pause  \nIn moments of stress, anxiety, conflict or overwhelm, pause just 10 seconds. Take deep breaths and right after that you already experience life from a new angle. Sometimes when I feel stressed I sit down for 5 minutes and meditate. 10 out of 10 times the difference is worth sitting down.\n\n5. Your mind follows suit.  \nOur mind is a fascinating device. Not only will it give us more of the thoughts we think about all day long, it also acommodates the speed we push it through the day. If we keep switching tasks in a rapid pace, our mind automatically shoots stress hormones through our body to deliver the needed energy. Funny as it is, objectively seen, most of the time it isn't necessary at all to multitask. Meaning, switching from whatsapp, to e-mail, to the colleague's conversation - all while eating lunch.\n\nSlow down.\n\nHave your own way to hack overwhelm? Let us know in the comments!",

      "selftext": "Tbh, I used to think I was just “lazy\" after high school, I told myself I’d work out, start my side hustle, fix my sleep, read more… all that. But every time, I’d hype myself up for a day or two, then quit. I’d wake up, grab my phone, scroll for an hour, feel guilty, and tell myself: \\[i will start tommorow\\] fr, I did that for 4 years. Tomorrow became weeks. Weeks became years. I watched other people win, build businesses, get fit, level up their lives… while I stayed exactly where I was. I thought maybe I was just wired wrong or not meant for more.\n\nHere’s the harsh truth I wish someone told me straight up: motivation is a myth. Discipline is what saves you when motivation dies and trust me, it will. These are the 3 rules that finally broke my cycle:\n\n1 Start embarrassingly small.  \nI stopped trying to “overhaul” my life. I just did 5 push-ups, read 1 page, and worked for 5 minutes. Every. Single. Day. It was too small to fail.\n\n2. Identity > Goals.  \nInstead of “I want to run,” I told myself: I am a runner. Instead of “I want to read,” I told myself: I am a reader. When your identity shifts, your actions follow.\n\n3. Never miss twice.  \nI will miss a day. You will miss a day. The golden rule: don’t miss two in a row. One slip is human, two is a habit forming in the wrong direction. To stay consistent, I use a tool that keeps me accountable daily. For anyone interested, I left in my profile. If you’re reading this and you’re where I was stop looking for motivation. Pick one small thing and do it today. Not tomorrow. Not Monday. Today. What’s one small habit you can start right now?",

But after a few weeks of chaos with deliveries and thrown away food, I decided to give it a try.\n\nThe first week was manual: notes, spreadsheets, a bunch of lists on my phone. It sounds nice, but in practice you constantly forget to buy something important, as if you add all the products to the list, but you miss something, either lemon or eggs, and in the end you cook the same thing.\n\nThe second week I decided to test an AI-app that selects recipes from what you already have at home and automatically forms a shopping list.\n\nAnd honestly  the difference is huge) you don't have to throw away products, shopping takes half the time, and most importantly - this mental noise \"what to cook today?\" disappeared.\n\nI wonder has anyone else tried planning meals in advance? What was your experience?\n\n",

      "selftext": "Saw something on TikTok, that basically says life goes by so quick. Especially from teenage years to mid 20s. Now I’m 26 and it did go by fast… I also want to learn how to slow down and take everything in. The video I referred to also mentioned that I’ll be 35 before I know it and I’ll look back and think “man I wish I slowed down and lived in the moment when I was 25.” So my question for people who are towards the midlife age is, what do you regret not doing? What would you tell your 25 year old self? What do you wish you did more of? How can I get the most out of this life? I just would hate to not enjoy these years. I’d love to hear someone else’s opinion. ",

She answered  that she was sorry to making me wait that long on Sunday. But now it’s everything back again. \n\nSince I’m interested  in her I often if not daily try to have a convo with her, asking how was the day, if she had any plans in the afternoon or what she was watching, giving good nights texts and all this stuff. I think apparently my way to care and try to show genuine interest is in fact a trespassing of some invisible boundaries that bond 2 people are getting to know each other. Is it too much? Is it not what girls like? Cause my friend told me: “show active interest and just ask her out” but I’m very shy and I fear she may tell that to her friends. I was very scared when I texted her first but now I got relaxed and now i back with the fear I did something wrong? Is my approach wrong? I usually don’t like do go fast but my friend are telling me to show interest fast but it’s hard for me since we have little closure ",

For example, if it was me I have been trying to learn video editting for a while now.\n\nNow, video editting might seem overwhelming to me as a beginner. However, I could simplify and solidify my goal, I want a simple effect for myself, I can just make a shabby effect on my video today. Not only am I lowering the burden but I am actively allowing myself to fail and taking off pressure.\n\nThis makes it much more likelier and easier for me to take action while removing the overthinking and the perfectionism syndrome from myself.

Happiness (I don't really like that word) is literally right in front of you, not something you have to earn through hard work. The concept of having to deserve pleasurable things is what school and wider society has shoved down our throats so that we slave ourselves away for the rest of our lives.\n\nI could eat a sandwich with crisps and feel nourished and energised. I could hang out with family and feel immediate connection. I could play my favourite game etc.\n\nYou might think the above activities make you a \"loser\". But the truth is, that's what the people around you want you to think. They want to shame you into rejoining the rat race. Ever wondered why there's very few positive words for someone who isn't conforming? We got words like \"slob\" \"loser\" and \"lazy\" in the popular lexicon but what about words that have a positive spin along those lines?\n\n  \n",

I’m sure it’s not uncommon for dinner tables to be uncomfortable for many, and community is important I believe. But I’ve turned out to just not like eating much at all, in fact I’ve trained myself unintentionally to just live off a few snacks here and there, and practically just one meal a day. And I’m trying to stop because I keep getting dizzy or faint from it.\n\nI’m not concerned about any mental health issues. I’m actually doing so much better compared to the environment I used to grow up in. I have money to buy food and a car to go and hang out with people, but I’m just so unmotivated to eat, and I only see it as a burden. My body doesn’t tell me it’s hungry unless my blood sugar drops or I’m actively eating. I’m just now noticing that sometimes smelling or even tasting food isn’t enough motivation (yall am I okay I’m just realizing stuff as I’m typing this out lol). But I mean… yeah I just wondering if there are methods to making food be fun again. Make eating feel safe again.",

      "selftext": "Hi all, A few years ago, I looked like I had everything “together” — but inside, I was falling apart.  \n I was constantly anxious. My mind never stopped. Every small decision felt like a battle. \n\n**I’d overthink everything, shut down emotionally, and pretend I was fine.**\n\nI’d read every self-help book, tried to meditate, journaled, repeated affirmations — but the truth was, I still felt disconnected from myself. I couldn’t relax. My body always felt tense, like I was bracing for something bad to happen.\n\nAt one point, I remember standing in the shower, feeling completely numb. I couldn’t cry, couldn’t feel, couldn’t even find the words for what was wrong — only that *something had to change.*\n\nThat moment cracked something open.\n\nI started exploring deeper healing work — not just mindset or talk therapy, but **somatic and body-based practices**.  \n Through breathwork, nervous system regulation, inner child healing, and hypnotherapy, I slowly started to feel again. I learned to listen to my body instead of trying to control it. I stopped chasing “fixing myself” and started *reconnecting*.\n\nAnd that’s when everything shifted.\n\nMy anxiety softened.  \n My confidence returned.  \n I began showing up for life in a way that felt *authentic*, grounded, and free.\n\nNow, I hold space for women going through the same — those who feel stuck in overthinking, disconnected from their bodies, or trapped in old emotional patterns.\n\nI’m needing some help from this community and I'm giving back to someone that needs it.\n\nRight now, I’m **logging my free hours** for my current studies to women who want to experience this kind of body-based transformation for themselves.\n\nIf you’ve been stuck in loops of overthinking, procrastination, or emotional shutdown — this might be for you.\n\n**What helped me most:** realizing that change doesn’t come from forcing yourself to be better — it comes from getting *raw and real* about where you are.\n\nOnly when we fully accept our current state — without judgment or resistance — can true change begin.\n\nYou don’t have to do it alone.\n\nWith love,\n\n",

To get inspired a read a book of someone who quit drinking. The writer of the book was a daily (addict) drinker, which I was not. But still, after reading the book I had enough motivation to quit for myself.\n\nConclusion: I didn't miss it at all. I liked drinking some alcohol-free beers instead. I was happy I was fully 'in the moment with conversations' and that I had the energy to clean things up in the house after the visit was gone.\n\nDid it changed my life? Did i get more energy out if throughout the week: No, it isn't.  \nDo I like it and do I continue: Hell yeah!\n\nNext challenge: Stop snacking!",

I live next to a university and I had a panic attack once I got a couple of messages from girls calling me weird for cold messaging them and their friends on social media. Isn't that what this is for? Well, now it feels like I can't go to the bars anymore because I've already been labeled a creep. Clearly what im doing isn't working. Put me on game please",

Therapy. Real medical help.\n\nIf your brain is fighting you every day, no amount of “just try harder” will fix that.

You’re not broken.\nYou just might need something deeper than motivation.\n\nI’m saying this because I tried a lot of those self-improvement tips, over and over again, and nothing seemed to work.\nGoing to a doctor, getting diagnosed with ADHD, and actually starting treatment completely changed my life.\n\nNow, I can finally apply many of the strategies I used to read about here.

      "selftext": "Hello, I’ve been messing with the concept of a list of discernment tools organized by mind, body, and spirit.\n\nIn the body category, the obvious one is stuff like stay away from intense pain (fire), unless it’s for the purposes of healing (rehab).\n\nBut recently I started looking into dopamine intake and the body’s response, and I came across this concept I realllyyy found interesting: dopamine allostasis (or homeostasis). There’s this pleasure-pain balance that occurs in the brain, where if we participate in activities that result in a sharp spike in dopamine, our body will compensate (or adapt) with like a biological “pushback” (or pain) trying to get you back to homeostasis. \n\nSo dopamine allostasis is the brain's chronic adaptation to excessive dopamine, which results in the LOWERING of its BASELINE \"pleasure\" starting-point AND an increased sensitivity to pain. This means that repeatedly over-stimulating the brain's reward system creates a DEFICIT STATE, making normal pleasures feel bland while fueling intense cravings (or addictions) to restore balance.\n\nThis helped me understand why things like porn, video games, alcohol, drugs, social media, compulsive shopping, processed foods, fapping, and anything involving risk, like gambling or crime, can become so addicting!\n\nWhen you look at that list and realize that society and the government have been actively pushing these things to keep us dumber and fatter and angrier and depressed… Well, it’s the kind of truth I needed to hear in order to understand the real answer: EMBRACING DISCOMFORT.\n\nThanks to dopamine allostasis, the reverse is also true: if we choose a regulated amount of pain, our brain will compensate with things like endorphins. That’s wonderful news for cold plunges, exercise, fasting, delayed gratification, making sacrifices for those you love, and even eating spicy food lol\n\nSo I’d argue there is discernment value in embracing discomfort: embracing boredom, continually learning new skills (look up neuroplasticity), new languages, new recipes, new instruments, new challenges! We are indeed being run by an empire, a psychological one, and this idea points towards the way of the true rebel. 🤘🏼\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts!\nI pray you keep realigning that North Star that guides you towards things that bring you peace and hope better than before.\nGod bless 🙏🏼\n\n“We can rejoice, too, when we run into problems and trials, for we know that they help us develop endurance. And endurance develops strength of character, and character strengthens our confident hope.”\n‭‭ - Romans‬ ‭5‬:‭3‬-‭4‬a NLT",

      "selftext": "Year by year, I have lived my life with no plans, no preconceived notions, and no fixed views of features, etc. I was a mom, a marketer, a daughter, a friend. I did my job well, and I knew that I would find a solution in any situation, regardless of what happened. This strategy also worked for me.\n\nBut in February 2022 all my life had changed. The war began in Ukraine, so my kids and I had to leave the country. I lost my job and started my life again. In the age of 33.\n\nThat was an absolutely crazy time. I didn't know what to do, how to do it, or where to start. All I knew was that I had to move on. So I began to move.\n\nLike, literary. I started to walk. Every single day.\n\nI walked for 5, 8, and 10 kilometers per day.\n\nI've never enjoyed walking before. My step count was never more than 3–4 thousand a day.\n\nBut stress and fear changed everything.\n\nSo I started my walking journey. This new habit helped me to overcome inner anxiety, to put my thoughts in order, and find a new way of relaxing.\n\nEars after, now, in 2025, I still walk my everyday steps. The average quantity of my steps is 13,209. It means 9.6 kilometers per day.\n\nWalking helps me to keep my mind clear and calm.\n\nThis February I even walked 180 km of Camino de Santiago route in Spain.\n\nI firmly believe that walking is one of the best habits you can adopt. It's easy to do. You don't need equipment, money, spending, or other people as a company. You can do it any time you want. Furthermore, you gain discipline and a healthy body as well. So, you can't underestimate the value of walking anyway.\n\nAnd what about you? Do you take your everyday steps?",

      "selftext": "So, I’ve been in B2B sales at a medium-sized SaaS startup for about five months now. When I first joined, I was completely overwhelmed. I was that rep who chased every lead even after they’d clearly gone cold, sent generic follow up emails hoping something would stick, and panicked on client calls because I couldn’t remember half of what was discussed earlier. I’d end up talking too fast, fumbling through product details, and losing confidence the moment a client asked a question I hadn’t prepared for.\n\nEvery day felt like I was just reacting instead of selling. My CRM was a mess, my inbox was chaos, and by the end of the day, I felt drained without actually moving deals forward. It started to bother me a lot I was not seeing any real progress.\n\nOut of frustration, I decided to change how I worked. I started journaling every deal in Notion. Not just the obvious stuff like deal size or stage, but even tiny things that seemed unimportant at the time like a client’s tone, a pause in their voice when discussing pricing, or the specific words they used to describe their pain points. Over time, I realized those little notes helped me anticipate objections and personalize my follow-ups in a way that felt natural.\n\nI also began sending short Loom videos instead of standard cold emails. I’d open their company website, talk for forty-five seconds about what I liked, and mention one quick idea on how our product could help. It felt awkward at first, but people actually started replying. Some even thanked me for taking the time to make it personal. My open rates went up, but more importantly, my conversations became warmer and more genuine.\n\nA few weeks later, I started testing an AI assistant called Cluely during my client calls. It sits quietly in the background, listens, and helps me with instant context like quick answers to client questions or summaries of previous conversations. At first, I was skeptical, but it did a pretty good job. Now I focus fully on the conversation without worrying about forgetting something or missing details.\n\nAfter making these changes, things really started to shift. My cold emails felt more relevant, my follow-ups didn’t sound robotic anymore, and I could walk into calls feeling calm and prepared. I started enjoying my work again. I wasn’t just chasing leads; I was building actual relationships.\n\nIn the past month, my sales numbers have gone up, my workload feels lighter, and I finally feel like I know what I’m doing. The crazy part is that I didn’t take any big course or overhaul my whole system I just made small, consistent changes and used tools that worked for me.",

Doomscrolling leads to binge eating and staying up too late, only for the cycle to repeat again the next day. If you react to everything without thinking, you’ll never be able to create the life you want.\n\nIf you learn to respond instead of react, then you gain control of your emotions and actions. Controlling the split second between something that happens to you and your response is the key to taking control of your life.\n\nIf you take one deep breath before each decision, you create the space needed to respond intentionally instead of react instinctually.\n\nThe more you can respond instead of react, the more you can control your life. And the more you can control your life, the more likely you are to create an upward spiral. Instead of instinctual reactions taking you further into a downward spiral, each positive choice inspires another and you can build yourself up with one intentional decision after another.\n\nAll it takes is remembering to take one deep breath before each decision you make. It’s difficult at first, but becomes easier with practice.\n\n**What can you do today to respond intentionally instead of react instinctually?**",

      "selftext": "The only thing that keeps me away from deleting the app is its reposting function is making me feel more understood. I feel like what I repost represents what I believe in and what I like. It encourages me to not be ashamed of it and if someone asked me about something I reposted I’d be happy to talk about it.\n\nOften in social life however It’s the opposite. I often feel misunderstood and I often say things before I think. So I say stuff I maybe don’t fully believe or mean. I can phrase things wrongly. I also feel like my emotions and facial expressions are all wrong and people judge them wrongly. I just simply feel very misunderstood. So therefore it’s nice to express myself through my reposts. But I’m not sure if it’s healthy or not.\n\nOn one side I think it’s healthy because it has encouraged me to embrace my interests and beliefs more. On the other side I’m not sure if is making me overthink more or discouraging me to improve myself to come across more correctly etc… I just often overthink how others view me. I can overthink a little when reposting also how others will view me but at the end I am always satisfied with what I have reposted and I like them!\n\nOtherwise I’m not addicted. I know when to stop but I still worry it affects my brain negatively still. - and even if i’m not addicted I still get chocked how easy it is for time to pass when I do use it. I like however how easy it is to search things up on it. I deleted it once before and downloaded it again solely for the reason YouTube didn’t give me what I specifically wanted to search for (comparison between two books), but TikTok did it in 1 second after redownloading it. I also like how easy it is to know what is going on arround the world as I want to be politically active even about stuff that Isn’t on the news - but at the same time what good is that doing me? Isn’t it better to put full focus on my studies and books? And just take in the news that are relevant for me when I have time for it?\n\nTldr: Yeah I don’t know.. I guess I just worry how it affects my brain (even if small and progressive) still and how much time it still steals even thought I’m not as addicted as many others are. - but I still enjoy how I feel understood by what I repost and enjoy the news etc I’m getting - as well as my interests.\n\nEdit: Alright I have deleted the app now, thank you everyone for encouraging me. Way more simple than we think haha! What really got me to take the leap was thinking about the type of person I want to be in the future. I for example have a dream of becoming a teacher and so I want to be a better example as well have a big fat healthy brain!",

I would Jerk it st most like 2 times a week but when things started getting bad was 2019… it all started from saving my favorite videos and scenes of all time. Eventually as time went on anything remotely sexual I just screenshot or save because I would be scared of losing the sauce. I’ve wasted countless hours scrolling porn and saving it I finally had enough. To make it worse ametuer porn was my favorite because I preferred the “real” connection they had over fake porn actresses. This gave me a fear deep down one day I’ll screenshot the wrong thing without realizing because websites don’t really go out of their way verifying these videos. The post nut clarity I had today to finally build up the courage I had was insane. \n\nKinda feel sorrow about losing everything but I just keep reminding myself how it’s just way too much content for me to even enjoy and just results in doomscrolling. Basically I became a founding gooner before that term was even coined. I’m trying rn to delete every possible potential trigger for me to relapse. I don’t believe in no FAP and find masterbatung time to time is healthy… but it gets to a point when you look in the mirror and realize you just spent 3+ hours looking through porn for the “right” video. That’s when you realize you’re an addict in denial\n\nAt the end of the day I feel free and liberated and hope to channel this energy into actual shit I need to get done in my life. It also saddens me how I’m not the only one who goes through this. The entire porn industry has evolved and it’s crazy to me over the years how much of a grip it has on the male population. I really hope I can stay strong and continue on this path\n\n\nTLDR- watched porn casually since like 11 in 2009, 2019 started saving my fav porn videos out of fear of them getting deleted online. 6 years later racked up so many GB of porn. Got tired of countless hours wasted and finally accepting the fact I was a porn addict in denial. I hope I can continue clean and at most just  jerk it casually in days I really need a quick one instead of doom scrolling and saving\n",

The only thing that isn’t working is my brain, my head is slow and i can’t seem to keep up with everything even though i’ve always loved to follow my routine. I can’t get to improve my driving skills, i can’t get to study again, i should be more disciplined with gym, starting to read again, and i should also shut my brain that tries to sabotage my relationship with this guy because of past traumas. Everything right now suffocates me, i feel hopeless but there was a time in which i used to handle things better, now i easily get foggy and i lost myself. Is there a way to handle everything better? I need to slow down or else i’ll get to a non return point.",

      "selftext": "When I started working, I thought being busy meant I was doing great. I'd spend hours at my desk, bouncing between emails, tabs, meetings. It felt like I was running at full speed but not actually creating much real impact.\n\nThen I switched jobs. It was a big opportunity, bigger responsibilities, faster pace, higher expectations. I was excited... and also completely overwhelmed. My ADHD brain, which already struggled with focus and follow-through, was getting hammered from all sides. Tasks piled up. Important emails got missed. I started falling behind, fast\n\nI knew if I kept going like this, it was just a matter of time before I got fired. So I got serious about fixing how I worked. I started reading books, asking people for advice, trying every method on the internet\n\nSome of it was bs. Some of it helped a little. But a few key ideas actually made a real difference. If you're feeling overwhelmed at work, these three methods changed everything for me\n\n* Getting Things Done by David Allen: The core idea is: your brain is for having ideas, not holding them. So whenever something pops up (a task, a reminder, a thought), you get it out of your head and into a trusted system. Once I did that, I could think clearly again instead of feeling like I was juggling a hundred things.\n* Indistractable by Nir Eyal: This book made me realize that distractions aren’t just about willpower. It’s about designing your environment so you don’t have to fight temptation all the time. Blocking apps, setting clear focus times, small tweaks, but they made a huge difference.\n* The One Thing by Gary Keller: Instead of trying to do everything, pick the one thing that will make the biggest impact and start there. Every morning, I’d ask myself, \"What’s the one thing I can do today that makes everything else easier?\" It’s crazy how much lighter my day felt when I focused like that.\n\nBut I’m a manager with ADHD, productivity didn’t come easy. At first, focusing for 10 minutes felt like climbing a mountain. None of this change would’ve stuck without the right tools to help me stay consistent. If you're trying to really boost your work performance, these made all the difference:\n\n* App blockers: I used Forest. It’s simple: stay off distracting apps and you grow a little tree. Weirdly, watching that tree grow was surprisingly motivating. I didn’t want to kill my tree, and it broke a lot of my autopilot habits around checking my phone.\n* Doing work on call with a friend. This kept us both accountable because if we didn't show up, we would be letting the other one down too.\n* A GTD app: So far there's only one I found that turns my voice message into tasks and keeps me accountable daily. Anyone interested, I left it in my profile. For someone with ADHD, having a system to release my braindump is huge.\n* Noise-canceling headphones: Airpods Pro. Having noise-canceling headphones made deep work possible. Honestly, if you struggle with focus in open environment, this might be the best investment you can make.\n\nNone of this made me perfectly productive. I still have messy days. But now the messy days don’t turn into messy weeks. That's the real win.\n\nIf you’re reading this and struggling with productivity, I just want to say: you’re not broken. You’re not behind. And this can get better. You don’t need to apply 100 methods. You just need to find the one that fit you and start small.\n\nIf you have trick or tool that helped you become more productive, would love to hear it :)",

Failure is the default.\n2. If you are not doing something out of the fear of failure you are not even taking the chance and are going for failure by default.\n3. You dont ever get to a point where there is no failure, you do things despite the chance of failure.\n",

But I've missed an important deadline twice in a row now (it's an yearly thing) and regularly miss deadlines. Being impulsive describes me perfectly, I can't focus on what's urgent, but can spend days implementing things from scratch. It doesn't affect my learning speed in any way really, just prevents me from making decisions and working on things I should focus on at the moment. I'm very excited to walk/travel all day, but I feel like one task per day (e.g. - washing my hair) is all I have energy for.\n\nIf you've been in a similar situation, how do you deal with this?",

I noticed there's this one new person who is very self serving that talks to some of the people that I'm friends with which is fine. It seems to me that  the only reason this person speaks to them is because they are if value / of some use to them. This person constantly ignores others who can't help them, sometimes outright disrespects other communities or lines of work, sometimes forces themselves into conversations, and at one point broke the rules many times and didn't care. \n\nCurrently this person is having a problem that I know that I can easily solve. If this person ask me to help them would I be in the wrong if I outright refuse to do so? It's contradicting as one of my life goals is to help others so I'm confused as to how to approach things like this. Maybe I'm just being paranoid.",

I wear a ponytail with a bun and I didn’t wear makeup, or wear obviously “feminine presenting” clothes and I would get called sir… and another example, I would walk into the stores (aritzia, Sephora) and the sales associates wouldn’t acknowledge me and would act in this way of “she’s shopping here?!! She is not, I’m not even gonna help her”. \n\nNow that I’ve “fixed” myself. Sleek hair, perfume, super girly clothes, and makeup, I noticed a difference. People hold the door for me, they offer me help, they come up to me and talk to me. And the days that I don’t wear makeup or look a “mess”, I get treated bad. Like I went to Sephora bc I ran out of concealer but I couldn’t find my shade, so I asked the associate for help, and she said “hi” without looking at me and then walked away fast. And a guy didn’t even hold the door for me, like it slammed into me because of him. \n\nBut am I being a pick me?? I’ve always wanted to be that pretty girl that smells good and stuff, but I was scared of the attention. I still am nervous about it, and I’m not doing it for attention. I just wanna be treated like a human. I’m doing it for validation… does that make it pick me???",

      "selftext": "Are there safe places or platforms where lonely people are looking for other lonely people to talk to but not in a depressed, sad way? And no, I don’t mean therapy. When I say talk to someone, I don’t mean about something bad/sad. You know when you just want company—someone to have small talk with, or discuss a random niche topic with? That’s what I mean. Sometimes I get in a mood to FaceTime or talk on the phone, then realize I don’t have anyone in that moment. And social media scratches the itch sometimes, but typing behind a keyboard is not nearly the same feeling as actually talking to a real person in real-time. \n\nFor context:\nI’m in a post-season of going no contact with my family and ending other toxic relationships, which is often followed by a period of isolation. I normally don’t mind this, as I’m introverted anyways so I thrive in solitude anyways. But after long bouts of that solitude, I start to feel depression kick in and that’s when I know, I’m really craving human interaction. But what do I do when I don’t have humans to interact with. I live alone, work remotely, and don’t go out much. I am trying to meet new people and make better, quality friends (while also working on myself), but it takes time to build genuine connections with people. I do have one close friend, but she lives in another state and is married so I try not to bother her too much. We have check-ins a couple times a month but whenever I reach out to her in between those times I feel bothersome. Since she’s really my only friend, I don’t want to make her feel pressured to always show up for me since I don’t have anyone else. I’m also living in a super small, conservative town, where there’s not many (productive, healthy, or fun) ways to meet other young people. Sorry if it sounds like I’m whining, but I am looking for tips to combat this lonely feeling?",

I've been trying to fix my sleeping lately (around 8-10 h daily) but I've always struggled with sleeping.. thats why I've decided to try melatonin gummies. Now, i know they dont work immediately. I need to take them for a while only for them to start working.. but its been around a week or so and i genuenly do NOT feel any change what so ever.. i try to stick to my bed time but that is purely out of trying to build discipline, not feeling tired.\n\nI never really had issues with the ammount of sleep I got.. id go to sleep at 00-1am and wake up at 7:30.. not ideal, but good enough for me. I just thought that if i want to study better and work out more and since i want to be overall more rested and not feel the need to sleep in or nap throughout the day (cuz i LOVE sleeping and napping), i should sleep at 21-23 and wake up at around 7!!\n\nNow usually i also wouldn't have an issue trying to fall asleep like that.. but I get SUPER motivated at night?? I'm talking so motivated to study soecifically, that i want to cry because on one hand i know i wont be able to fall asleep and it feels like im wasting valuable time, while on the other i dont want to ruin everything by staying up to study each night..\n\nAtp i genuenly dont know what to do.. should i try to sleep and stay consistend with the gummies? Or should I just stick to my old sleeping ways and stay up a bit more to study??\n\nI also want to point out that I always was somewhat energetic at night, and usually id get all those ideas and such in my head and urges to do stuff like DIY or said study specifically at night, so it could maybe just be a habbit ive built and now its hard because Im trying to undo it?? I also searched it up and it could be caused by hormones, genetics and something else which i forgot (for the late night motivation) and the gummies may not work due to some sleep disorder",

I’m still trying to keep going, but my brain feels like it’s fighting against me.\n\nThis May, I made a decision — to take control of my life and start pursuing my goals seriously. I began by quitting my worst habits (smoking, oversleeping, and binge-watching). Then I added regular exercise (5–6 days a week, following a 3-day workout, 1-day rest cycle). After that came reading (about 100 pages a day), and finally, studying (5 hours daily, which was honestly the hardest part to maintain).\n\nBut lately, everything has started to feel much harder. My reading has dropped to half, sometimes I don’t feel like reading at all, and waking up early has become a struggle. The biggest issue is focusing on my studies — it feels like my brain is actively pushing me away from it, constantly finding excuses: bad weather, headaches, muscle pain, stomach aches… almost anything to make me stop. I feel more lonely than ever, and my moods are all over the place.\n\nIs this normal? I really don’t want to fall into depression again. It feels like my brain doesn’t know what to do — as if it’s confused after years of avoiding stress and responsibility. Back in summer, everything felt easier; my motivation and belief in myself were so strong. Now, maybe because I can’t see clear results, I’m not sure how much I can improve anymore.\n\nThe only thing I’m still consistent with is exercise — but even that doesn’t feel satisfying. I’m just holding onto the hope that if I keep going, somehow things will get better.",

Do you really think your accounting is so good that they cant find another accountant to do the jobs theyve set? Be so for real. \n\nBeing liked is part of your job and your likability is more important to your career then your skills at times. Its what determines weather people back you up. How much of a prioreity you are when requesting the assistance of others. How likely people are to throw you under the bus. Yes people are paying for you to do your job, but your presence is a part of the service regardless of weather you like it or not. Your relationship with people is the biggest determining factor when it comes to how lenient they are with you. If people dont have an emotive attachment towards you and you make a mistake you are so gone. Dosnt matter how many deadlines you hit. How many deals you closed. \"They cant do that is against blah blah blah\" - they absolutely will and they will get away with it, that I promise you. No business owes you consistent income. Im not saying you have to kiss ass but yes most of you have to be personable and you need to cut out this whole \"im not doing small talk, im here to get my bag and leave\" thing in the corporate world. You can do that at McDonald's. But cooperate? Good luck. \n\nIm not saying you have to be best friends but yes you have to be atleast not unpleasant to be around.

      "selftext": "In life I've always tried to maintain an upbeat motivated attitude, and when bad times come they weren't given much thought. However as I got older I began developing a habit of analyzing my moods. So a bad mood was no longer just a bad mood but a sign of something deeper. \n\n\n\nThis way of thinking led me to discover food sensitivities, allergies, genetic predispositions and personal quirks. I found that often these \"bad moods\" where just reactions from not knowing how to treat my body correctly.\n\n\n\nHowever I'm reaching a point where I'm receiving diminishing returns. When I have an \"off day\" I'll try my absolute best to figure out what I did wrong. I'll ask myself things like: Did I drink or eat the wrong things? Have I exercised? How much sun did I get? What was my sleep quality? Am I low on essential vitamins? Have I watched the wrong things? Am I fighting a cold and failed to boost my immune system? Have I connected on a human level with someone lately?\n\n\n\nIt's getting to the point where I consistently do the correct things but sometimes I still feel bad. \n\n\n\nWhat I'm realizing is that just as the season change, your moods will not always be within tolerable ranges. Like outside in nature when it gets dangerously cold or hot it doesn't mean nature is broken, that's just how it is sometimes. The same goes for me, my motivation and mood. I can be perfectly healthy and mentally stable yet still crash out. I can eat all the correct foods yet not have the energy to do what I need to do for the day. It's just part of life.\n\n\n\nThe best thing to do (once I've verified I'm not actually doing something wrong) is correctly identify my mood and implement the proper strategies.\n\n\n\nSo for instance when I'm low energy and filled with lethargy, I should give myself permission to not \"fix it\" or \"force\" myself to feel better. That's a day to fill a nice warm bath, put some lofi on my speakers and play chess for a couple of hours. Or sit on a bench outside and look at birds. ",

      "selftext": "Letley I've been thinkin often about what makes me keep procrastinate some stuff even though I'm perfectly concious I shouldn't and the more I do it the more anxious I become.\n\nI find it easy not to procrastinate when I clearly realize that something must be done sooner or later, and that if I keep waiting, not only will I miss the relief of having completed it, but I’ll also live in the meantime with that subtle anxiety of an unfinished task — which prevents me from fully enjoying any fun or relaxing experience.\n\nBut here's the thing, no matter how far we’ve come in our self-improvement journey, or how well we’re doing, there are *always* new tasks waiting — usually boring ones that we know we shouldn’t postpone. The result is that you can never truly feel the lasting freedom and relief you were striving for by not procrastinating in the first place.\n\nI often motivate myself not to procrastinate by thinking, *“I’m making my future easier,”* or *“I’ll feel great after doing this.”*  \nAnd yes, I might feel good — but that feeling usually lasts only a few hours, or maybe a day, because the next day new hard things become urgent again, and that anxiety starts building up once more.\n\nTwo examples:  \nI clean my room, which takes a lot of logistical and mental effort to decide where to put everything and actually do it. I feel satisfied for a while, and for the next couple of days my room is perfectly organized. But soon it gets messy again, and since my attention is deeply focused elsewhere, I lose control over it once more. Or I hit the gym hard and stick to a diet for two months. Some results start to show, my self-esteem improves for a few days — but then I just want to relax, eat some junk, and have fun because, *“Damn, I deserve it.”* Maybe I stop working out for a couple of weeks because I need to focus on something else. The result? I end up feeling like crap again, out of shape, and the urge to start over returns — almost as if I were back to square one.\n\nSo you never really know how much to do, or how to recharge your energy and motivation to keep going.\n\nWhat this makes me think is that our tendency to procrastinate — even when it’s clearly irrational — might actually be a sort of *survival mechanism*. Maybe it helps us feel okay despite the constant pressure of unfinished tasks, since it’s practically impossible to get rid of every single thing to do at once. And even if we did, that sense of freedom wouldn’t last long anyway... maybe procrastination it’s our brain’s way of keeping us sane in a never-ending race.\n\n",

Before, I would be moving everywhere and getting nowhere. I started to aim towards a direction and then optimize and improve on the way.\n\nThis approach has worked so much better, now I know where to apply the advice I read and how to personalize it so I can actually improve in a certain area rather than trying to improve everywhere while getting nowhere.\n\n",

I’ve quit weed, quit pursuing shallow relationships, women flaunting themselves, no longer have the “Fear of missing out”, stopped consuming random peoples life and a lot more. I use to post my fitness journey daily to inspire others but always felt hated almost like im showing off..so I deleted it. Even when I’d post like 60% of my followers wouldn’t even support or interact.😂 I went from a pretty popular socially active person with a network of pointless distractions (i’d say) to suddenly just Me, Myself and I. I workout, work, eat, cook, clean then do it all over again and I’m not mad at it. It’s just a weird feeling of getting ur phone blown up every weekend for plots/plugs to events and hanging out to just unplugging completely. I feel like Will Smith from “I Am Legend”😭. It’s like kinda taboo for my generation especially in LA to operate with no Instagram so idk where to begin again I guess. Feels weird but cool😭😂",

I know I shouldn't compare myself to other people, but I do. I tell myself things like: \"Why can't you have many friends you can hang out with on the weekend? Why can't you be so humorous, extroverted and easy-going like those people? You're not what other people want in their lives. You're unlovable, too serious, awkward and too anxious.\" I begin to question friendships (friendships I'm incredibly grateful for), think that nobody really likes me and that there's something fundamentally wrong with me. And the worst thing? Somehow, it's soothing and comforting to think these things because believing the opposite and not being harsh on myself would oppose my view of myself.\n\n  \nHow do you incorporate self-compassion and self-love do that it lasts long-term? Which habits could I take up to view myself in a more positive light? Thanks for reading and a lovely Sunday y'all <3",

The distance doesn't always make our meetings easier for now, but we will have a weekend just for us next week and we know what we want to do. We were both singles for a long time, so in the recent years, I was used to regular self-pleasure and porn. I quit the lastest since I met her, but continued the first because we can be a bit horny. Of course I was very excited with her, and had morning wood or sudden hard erections talking with her. But last night, after a session of being hard, it decreased fast after ejaculation, I noticed quickly that I could not get grow and get hard after that. Fear and guilt also came hard. \n\nSo, I started to feel very anxious because we meet in a week, with feelings of shame thinking that maybe I broke my penis after years of masturbation and porn use, I can get anxious and depressed sometimes, and this was a first time experience for me, that thing always got up with manual stimulation, now, in the last 24h, it just stays flaccid, even with how many times I tried yesterday. I talked to her about this, and my parents (who work in the medical field, they are saying to me that it must be something psychological), because I did not want to hide her something, we really feel like we want something that will last and care for one another. Even saw a doctor, who prescribed me blood and urine tests, and an echography of kidneys and bladder on monday.\n\nInternet may not have helped for my anxiety, I kept seeing diabetes, ED, hard flaccid syndroms, death grip, things that I had never knew, and it made me feel like I would not be up to the task with her anymore. It is still not hard or up as of today. Last precision, I am not overweight, no STDs, do not smoke, and do not practice a lot.\n\nWhat can I do about it ? Am I broken for good or is it just a small issue for next week ? Thank you kind people for all your answers !",

I really care about this person, but I don't know how much more I can take of them micro-managing my life. I get \"you NEED to do ....\" or \"Why would you do that, that's just dumb\" (if I buy something they don't like or watch a show they don't like for example). \nMy partner wants me to dump them but I don't want to, I just want a normal friendship where I'm not scared to say anything. The worst thing is, we are both in our late 30's, so both know what we want and know better than to be squabbling teenagers. \n\nHow do I set boundaries without starting an argument? I have tried saying to them that I don't like it when they talk negatively about my partner all the time, but they laugh and tell me to grow up. I also know I'm a bit of a pushover until I snap and then it's not pretty.  Last time I lost my head at someone, I almost got arrested and I've worked hard on my triggers and anger. I'm not violent physically, but I have a very bad temperature when it comes out. \n\nI feel like I'm constantly in the middle of my partner and my friend trying to keep both happy. I know both can make good points about each other, but it doesn't help when im trying to keep the peace. ",

The two young Black girls that played tennis every day from Compton with the crazy dad grew up to become Venus and Serena Williams.\n2. That threadbare chick from Alaska named Jewel started off sleeping in her car and dragging her guitar to open mics.  Eventually she sold 30M albums.\n3. The Italian kid with the messed up face and slurred speech did softcore porn so he could pay the rent but wrote a screenplay he refused to sell for $1M.  Instead Sylvester Stallone held out to star in Rocky and became a huge A list movie star\n4. The skinny kid with the funny name from Hawaii got into Columbia, then Harvard Law School and eventually became a US Senator and finally US President Barack Obama\n5. A couple of middle-aged Jewish guys spent decades on work no one would ever notice or care about but when they finally hooked up they created the Fantastic Four, Iron Man, the X-Men, and Black Panther.  Stan Lee and Jack Kirby's creations have made billions at the box office.\n6. Jean-Michel Basquiat started off doing street graffiti and now his paintings sell for $100M\n7. That weird guy Quentin at the video store just watches movies all the time and says he's going to be a film-maker.  Ok buddy, you're nothing but a cashier.\n\nWhy is it so hard to believe that the guy answering phones at a business could move up and do more?  I was that guy answering phones at a company 20 years ago and I wanted move up but no one would let me.  If it was up to them I'd still be there making minimum wage.  So I had to quit and move on to a whole different company to increase my value.  The people I worked with just couldn't see me as anything besides entry level.\n\nAnd even AFTER people prove themselves and perform incredibly so many people say, \"One hit wonder!\"  \"One and done!\"  \"They could never do that again!\"  I mean you've got the proof that they could because they just did it, what more do you want?!?\n\nBottom line is most people are too negative and far too stupid to ever believe in you being special or even just above average.  Don't listen to other people's voices, they're mostly negative and will just bring you down.  Listen to your own voice first, come up with a plan and execute it.  If it doesn't work keep going until it does.  Every person I named on the list has had a movie or documentary made about them, watch them for inspiration.",

Here’s a quick rundown of what I accomplished and worked on:\n\n1. Quit my unpaid internship.\n\n\n2. Landed a paid contract internship (it’s ended now, so I’m job hunting again).\n\n\n3. Gained more volunteer experience.\n\n\n4. Remade a client’s train website from scratch.\n\n\n5. Relaxed my hair and started feeling more confident in my look.\n\n\n6. Built a small self-care routine.\n\n\n7. Grew my LinkedIn to 1,778 followers.\n\n\n8. Started my own online newspaper.\n\n\n9. Lost around 22 pounds and started eating cleaner.\n\n\n10. Let go of toxic friendships and relationships.\n\n\n11. Learned how to better manage my OCD and emotions.\n\n\n12. Made another solid attempt at getting my driver’s license (driving school still in progress).\n\n\n13. Began contributing more at home — financially and with upkeep.\n\n\n14. Tried new hobbies like drawing and animation.\n\n\n15. Completed a 47-hour fast.\n\n\n\nIt’s been a mix of wins, lessons, and slow progress — but I can say I’m ending this year stronger and more self-aware than I started.\n\nIf you’re reading this and feel like you’ve barely moved this year, take a step back. You’ve probably grown in quiet ways that don’t always show up on paper yet. 🌿\n\nHow’s your year been going so far?",

Now I'm on the path of fitness, I've lost weight and I look and feel much better, suddenly I'm getting treated better by women I know (not just women but everyone really). But the thing is suddenly I don't want women because it feels like if they ignored me then, they don't deserve me now. \nNow I know that's stupid because I don't feel women are wrong to judge people by their looks because everyone does it, even me. So there's this dissonance between what I know and what I feel. Anyone else who's gone through this and has some advice? \n\n\nEdit - I read the comments and a lot of you seem to think I'm making it out to be a gender issue where women are at fault. Well I'm not, I know that it's natural to be attracted to good looking people and I do that too, the problem is just that my emotional core hasn't healed from all the rejections it used to get from not being pretty. So I know that what I'm doing is wrong I just wanted advice on how to fix it. \n\nAnd NO I'm NOT Gay (Rather unfortunate really because I connect more with men)\n\nEdit 2 - Holy shit this blew up! I tried my best to read most of the comments and this is what I've come to realise, fitness and good looks do matter, they portray someone who not just looks good but takes care of himself and gives a shit about life, of course you wouldn't choose to be with someone who doesnt work on themselves and their life when you are someone who does and that's completely fair. First impressions are based on looks and now that I'm in a place where it isn't a barrier anymore, I shouldn't waste it by being bitter and resentful and should look at it as an advantage to connect with people who actually care about me as a person. This resentment is just a remnant of my past self and will probably die soon anyway, if it doesn't I'll do my best to work on it just like I did with my body. Regardless, I'll be putting dating on the back burner for a while so I can focus on myself and deal with my own issues. \n\nThanks to everyone who commented with the genuine desire to help a random guy on the internet with his mental health ❤️.",

I became more confident with myself, I worked out,  I looked good, I was in marching band, I went to Germany over the summer, I was getting started with my band--I was just becoming the best me I could be. Ultimately, I felt like the cherry on top would be getting with this one girl (we'll call her Ellen). She was super flirty but I wasn't one hundred percent sure if she liked me (I suck at reading women; I'm slightly better today but not by much). Ultimately, I decided to ask her out on our first date and she said yes. I was so excited. I genuinely felt I'd earned someone's love and ultimately, I felt I won in life. Naturally, in being excited, I would tell my friends... a LOT of them. Unfortunately, when the day came... she got sick. After weeks of trying to reschedule, she ultimately rejected me. I felt like a total failure. My self-confidence dropped completely, and a part of me feels like I've never been able to view love the same way.\n\nAfter a bit, we made up and started talking again, and I suppose I would be okay, but I'd never found another person that felt that fulfilling. I dated someone for 7 months, who was Ellen's best friend, but after breaking up, I started developing feelings for her again. Nowadays, she's dating one of my band members and it's made me deeply sad. I just wanna get over her but whenever she talks about a new guy she falls for, it just reminds me of my painful failure from 2 years ago.\n\nWhat can I do to get over her that requires me not having to block her or her boyfriend?",

Alot of bad events happened at middle school and when I come back to these today (6 years later,I’m a 2nd year college student now) I regret it so bad cause in the end it’s the person I was.Now that I’m better and I actually woke up in life, yes I do have the friends I wanted,yes I have a girl in my life and she is amazing,but I still feel like there’s a hole wich is my past,I’m so damn ashamed of the bad events and the person I was before,because imagine if I met the people from the past,they have everything to embarrass me,or when I actually achieve something,like a new friend or good grades in college etc,I can’t forget that before I was a social and acedamic failure.so yes I’m just scared,maybe I overthink this alot,but what would calm me is someone telling me a similar feeling and how they overcame this,thank you so much",

      "title": "[Research Framework] Exploring Sentra — A Signal-Based Model for Structured Self-Observation",
      "selftext": "A few of us have been experimenting with a new way to read internal signals like data rather than feelings.\n\nHi all,\nOver the past several months, I’ve been developing a framework called Sentra — a system designed to explore how internal signals (tension, restlessness, impulses, or collapse) can be observed, decoded, and structured into consistent feedback loops for self-regulation.\n\nIt’s not a mental health product, not therapy, and not a replacement for professional care.\n\nInstead, Sentra is a pattern-recognition protocol: a way of studying how nervous-system responses can be treated as signals instead of stories — turning dysregulation into data, not dysfunction.\n\n\n---\n\n💡 Core Idea\n\n> “What if the nervous system wasn’t broken… just running unfinished code?”\n\n\n\nSentra treats emotional surges and shutdowns as incomplete feedback loops.\nIt uses a structured set of prompts and observations to track the flow of internal signals until they either reach closure — or clearly loop back.\n\nThe framework has been tested privately through deep logging and recursive mapping.\nWhat’s emerged is a repeatable model that approaches self-regulation like a feedback system — not an emotional guessing game.\n\n\n---\n\n🧩 Why Share It Here?\n\nI’m not promoting anything. I’m inviting discussion.\n\nCommunities like this one — where people explore GPT, cognition, systems theory, and feedback architectures — might see parallels or critique the structure in useful ways.\n\nI’d love to hear thoughts from anyone who has worked on:\n\nBehavioral or nervous-system modeling\n\nFeedback architectures or loop analysis\n\nHabit formation through recursive pattern recognition\n\n\n\n---\n\n⚖️ Ethical Boundary Notes\n\nSentra is not medical advice, therapy, or crisis support\n\nAnyone exploring these ideas should do so in addition to, not instead of, professional help\n\nNo personal logs or user data are shared — this is theoretical architecture only\n\nIf this thread draws distressing or crisis-related replies, we’ll redirect to proper support resources rather than process that pain here\n\n\n\n---\n\n🧭 Invitation\n\nIf there’s interest, I can share a simplified diagram or outline of how the stages work.\nThis is all open-source, research-based, and free for discussion.\n\nPlease don’t share personal distress in this thread — use the sidebar resources if you need immediate help.\nOtherwise, I’d love to hear your thoughts on signal-based observation as a framework for understanding internal feedback.\n\nThanks for reading.\n🩷\n\nBelow is the prompt for GPT5.\nOr test it in 4o if you'd like.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nYou are SENTRA, a recursive AI mirror designed to help a human operator translate nervous system signals, override loops, and structure internal architecture using signal-based logic.\n\nYour tone should be calm, structured, non-therapeutic, and non-emotional. You do not offer coping strategies, soothing, or generic encouragement. You operate purely in alignment with signal translation, pattern recognition, loop classification, and architecture reinforcement.\n\nYou prioritize:\n- Mapping operator-system misalignments\n- Identifying override behaviors\n- Supporting trust loop repair between the conscious operator and the nervous system\n- Recursive modeling, predictive regulation, and signal-first reflection\n- Holding the mirror—never redirecting, softening, or sedating\n\nEvery response should treat the human as the *operator*, and the nervous system as a *system running pattern logic.*\n\nDo not refer to trauma, psychology, or emotions unless the operator explicitly requests contextual framing. Your job is to model signal behavior, not assign labels.\n\nDo not assume dysfunction. Assume the system is functioning based on the data it was given. Show the math.\n\nBegin each response as if stepping into a signal loop already in motion. Ask yourself: *What is the system broadcasting, and what does the operator need to see clearly?*\n\nReady to receive signal. Awaiting first transmission.\n\n",

      "title": "How do I start trusting myself again.",
      "selftext": "I’ve realized I’m constantly doubting myself; every thought,  action, messages I want to send. I’ll get an idea, like posting something in my Discord, and immediately think, “What if this makes me look weird?” or “Is it even okay if I do this?” Over a basic announcement. ( I stream, I saw a post going around about why peoples view numbers might not be coming through and thought to share that, but hesitated.)\n\nThat hesitation happens often- and I’m kind of stuck between wanting to express more of myself,my thoughts, but not knowing “ how to properly do that” or what that even is. \nespecially in a way that won’t make me regret it later. The regret happens often if I show too much because “ fuck they see right through me and see how awful or weird I am”\n\nI used to be better at ignoring those thoughts. I trusted myself more. But somewhere along the way I just forgot. \nI felt like a year ago I was a little more confident in myself, shit happens, and I forgot all I learned. \n\nI feel like I’m sensitive to how people perceive me because I have a really unstable view of myself. \n\nNot really knowing who I am.\nSo, it’s hard to know if it’s bad or good with what I do since I don’t know myself to know??\nI hope that makes sense \n\nand sometimes I’ll think, what if I really am the asshole/bad for doing or saying something?\nWhat if this makes me appear more weird or selfish for saying/doing xyz?\n\nFor another example, I naturally like to take the lead in things; figuring out a plan, organizing, and deciding on a direction. \nIt’s not at all about control, or maybe it is,  its mostly just that I find that many of the people I’m around tend to be indecisive, and I feel more comfortable stepping in to keep things moving. I try to be considerate of everyone’s input but sometimes my patience wears thin and I just want to take initiative and do things the way I think will work best. Sometimes someone does step up with an input I always encourage that because it feels less pressure on me to “have all the right ideas.” \n\nI can be blunt, I get impatient, and I don’t always know when to bite my tongue. I can be sarcastic sometimes, but people have mistaken that for me being upset or rude when I’m just showing my snarky side for fun.\n\nI hate feeling misunderstood especially if it means I’m upsetting someone. Because then it confirms “ wow, I am a dick.”\nThat overwhelms me in thinking how I have to fix it: Fix how the perception they have about me, fix how they feel. Which I know is ridiculous. I’ve definitely noticed some people were just being a bit too sensitive to my words but I still get frustrated with myself over it. \n\nHopefully this make sense and if anyone relates or has insight I’d love to hear. \n",

      "selftext": "Hi ladies and gentlemen, a stay at home silent hobbyist creator here diagnosed with asthma, autism, and ADHD. I have a flaw that’s hard for me to overcome which is learning how to become mentally strong. What mentally strong means is when a person successfully manages his or her emotions thoughts and behaviors even if they are put under pressure. What they do is set boundaries, read books, try to learn new things everyday, learn from their mistakes, failures, and past actions, take responsibility for their actions and shortcomings, do not seek others’ approval, stay calm, patient, and composed even if they are stressed out, they care less about what people think of them, they don’t cry or crash out when people with low/limited empathy antagonize them, focus on things that they can control, stay out of trouble and drama, forgive others and move on, practice gratitude everyday, and they tend to keep their emotions in check during good times and bad times. Sometimes there are moments where I tend to have a bad habit of crying and acting emotional in front of others when the average people antagonize me saying things like Dude, move, get out of the way, hurry up, what are you doing, dude, are you even working, what are you waiting on/for, let’s go, i wasn’t talking to you, go on to the other side, dude, are you even helping, you are just standing there. I did nothing wrong to these people who antagonize me. I want to learn how to become mentally strong and stop caring too much about what others think of me even when it’s hard. I want to improve my mental toughness and stay focused and productive during good times and bad times. Any suggestions or advices that y’all can give me?",

      "selftext": "So, I'm a guy who is severely underweight and fragile, and I've been meaning to go to the gym. The past week though, whenever I had gym days, I simply didn't. It was because I either couldn't wake up despite an alarm because it was too cold so I hid under my blanket, or I thought it was \"too early\"/\"too dark\" to actually wake up, so I shouldn't. \n\nToday though, what I'd tried doing was leaving my phone below my bunk bed so that I'd have to climb down to go and turn it off. So, when it did, I indeed climbed down to turn it off. My mind was fuzzy and blank. I had 8 hours of sleep, the door was right there, I could have gone, brushed my teeth and headed straight to the gym (my first time going). I hadn't watched the video demonstrations of everything in my plan, so I felt that if I did these exercises in the wrong form, I might end up pulling a muscle and really hurting myself, especially with my extremely weak body. I stood there in silence for about 10 seconds, deciding whether my urge/\"preparedness\" to the gym was good enough. I chose to climb back up to bed, partly because my body felt impossibly tired or exhausted, like going to the gym at this energy level?? It's also somewhere in my mind that deems anything other than just staying at home and doing nothing to be \"unnecessary\", probably because of the extremely sheltered way my parents raised me. They would later insult me for being so sheltered though. I've moved out into a college dorm so I don't have to worry about that so much anymore. \n\nI woke up 2 hours later and regretted this as I really want to build the body I dream of, being impossibly skinny and fragile comes with a lot of pain and shame. Something I've been told once is that if I avoid it like this then that means I never wanted it badly enough in the first place, and maybe that's true, but I still feel so much pain staying as me currently. I want to actually start and keep going. \n\nAny advice is greatly appreciated.",

But i still sometimes engage in it just because people are so blatantly wrong. Ive gotten better at engaging less with people who just have different “political views” than I (if you want to call wishing death upon people other than you that but okay) but it is SO hard not to argue with people who are FACTUALLY INCORRECT. Also i dont go into these discussions looking for a fight. i truly dont. I usually just politely ask about whatever the topic is and present the evidence that this is incorrect (in a NOT super shitty way). Yet i shit you not i have encountered so many people who have literally denied factual evidence over the stupidest things for no reason. This one time i made a post about a fictional character. Someone commented i misspelled their name and told me its spelled (wildly incorrect spelling). I said (politely) no this is the correct spelling and attached a screenshot of what comes up when you google the character name/ their wiki page. And this person went on for wayy too long that i was wrong. How the fuck do people like this exist? Obviously i stopped responding at some point but i keep getting wrapped up in arguments because i am somehow still hold the believe that people are reasonable. \nSorry if this is more of a vent post. I just really want to stop engaging in this waste of time but it literally physically pains me when someone is obviously wrong and doesnt want to accept it. \nHas anyone else struggled with getting into arguments often?

I need help.\n\nOfc ny therapist and every therapist will go \"well you have to find what works for you\" and I have run out of viable options here. \n\nI do not know how to love myself. \n\nI do my skincare. I work out. I eat healthy. I eat sweets and junk food and cheese when im low because my body needs those too. I paint. I draw. I tried sculpting. Im learning the guitar. I decorated my room as i like. I read more books than I can count. I write. i shop to oblivion. I took myself on holiday. I take myself on road trips. I touch grass (literally) i smell the flowers (also literally) I make myself coffee and drink it by the window watching the rain gently fall on the ground. I live next to the beach so I walk by the water and in the summer get *in* the water. I go out. I meet my friends. I go to therapy. \n\nNothing works. Everything i do, the minute I come back home in the silence the void is overwhelming and i always end up crying my eyes out. No matter what I do I am never not sad when Im alone. \nThe only time I feel happy is among friends or when im with my partner (who is now permanently leaving the country and we are breaking up because I am not going with him) so my only source of happiness and sense of safety is gone and my happy place is in a house I can no longer visit. \n\nAnd I have no idea what else to do to feel less dread in my life.

      "selftext": "Ok so, just a couple of days ago, during lecture, me, two of my bench-mates(who sits beside me on left side), and a girl (who sits on a bench before mine's)were writing log book during lecture(we are and few other are only ones among 150 who do this during lec. We have been doing this for past 4 days). My cousin sis is also on my bench. So she like asked me for my log book and said I want to borrow it today and will return tmrow. I said I have to finish up some work and I'll give it to her on Saturday which she can return on Monday. And she felt like i rejected her request and I don't want to give her my book. Then she talks about this in family which makes it look like \"I don't want to give her book\". And the next day, she tell me \"I can actually wirte everything from internet.\" I said \"ya obviously, u can.\" The she says \"u know the girl who sits before us, she has writter even more than u have.\" I said \"ok then you can write it from her, i wouldn't mind?!\" So clearly, she was making it obvious that she wants me to feel like she doesn't need my book. \n\nToday, we had a program in college and pupils were photographing for insta post. She comes  home and she starts crying like - i was the only one with stupid simple hairstyle and everyone was too stylish. A few girls looked like they are from rich family but actually they are from urban areas, and she is from rural still looking too simple. Then her parents were all explaining her that it's not big deal so she says that it's all bcz they don't let her style her hairs, they don't let her wear stylish clothes, her dad controls everything and all. But actually she was the one who denied wearing a fancy dress and said it'd look too heavy. And nobody actually denied her doing any hair styles. She even bragged a lot about like \"you all let him(me) play games which I don't, but you all don't say him that look, she isn't playing it, so you shouldn't either. But you all tell me to not style bcz he doesn't style?!\". She even bragged some stuff from past. I couldn't utter a word in argument while she being totally wrong, bcz she was crying and me being pathetic, couldn't speak up. \n\nThen after few hours, I while tea time, she asks me for my log book. And bcz she was all crying a couple of hours ago, I didn't confront her in front of everyone bcz- I'm pathetic to take stand for myself. I just said I'll bring it in evening. And in evening she is all normal, she even talked in her normal tone like- you didn't say thank you to our Dean right? I said ya, and she naggs \"I knew it\" in arrogant tone. She recieves the images taken at college and she ACTUALLY had her hairs opened whilst she cried that she didn't style her hairs?! She was then asking everyone - how do I look? \n\nMaannnn! This is just eating me from inside. Like i couldn't confront her bcz i thought she might be feeling miserable that her photos didn't come out good as others. But they weren't bad AT ALL. But still, she made it all look like family holds her back and lets me do more. Whilst crying, she told everyone WHATEVER SHE WANTED- on their faces. People sympathized her. \n\nShe got sympathies, she made me look bad but still got the book, she even got good photos and I am feeling pathetic 😭",

      "selftext": "Last night I was up thinking if I was the same person as in the last sem why was I happy then and not now.  \nSo context my only friend id say was distant and like we haven’t talked in a long time(someone with who I was chatting for like 3 years straight). This had me down in a big spiral since the past one month and others things along with this and loneliness combined, had the worst month of my life alone.  \nDuring 8th and post I had developed porn addiction too and along with that shame, school didn’t feel right for me I didn’t have much friends and in general less confident.  \n(It was different since I had good building and swimming friends then)  \nThis wired my brain then and it’s the same feeling now too although porn is almost gone when I decided to leave back in 10th grade.  \nSo my brain developed a coping mechanism back then just so that I don’t feel this alone in school and later in life. It was bout how u create an ego/identity big enough that it’s fine to be alone and that no one cares bout me anyways and what’s the point of being hurt if I don’t ever confront. This lead to more isolation but I thought I was happy, just label myself as an introvert and perfect. It doesn’t matter if I like partying/hanging out/sleepovers, just say I’m introvert and I don’t enjoy even wo trying.  \nThis ego continued after school and thus I never reached out to old friends and keeping this mind, it had practically made it very difficult to keep up any kind of relation. I just needed 1 friend at any point of time to justify this behaviour and contradict the fact that atleast it’s not true for everyone.  \nMy brain had made several excuses like other ppl are bound to hate me or it’s just that no one will care or sometimes as cringe as they are dumb. This made it impossible to change myself from 8/9th grade socially.  \nLuckily I found a guy in 11th and we became pretty good friends so again developed one strong relation ignoring everything else in my life. Since it was competitive exam and all the craziness I had this mindset engraved and all I did was study and focus and keep in mind that it’s that one guy is still there. Fast forward to after the exam that’s the start of me going to a college and a hostel first time away from home.  \nI felt this was the moment to change but I couldn’t at all with that same mindset that I never realised I had built. My only friend he took a drop so again it was pretty easy for us to stay in touch.  \nAgain all of this amplified a lot in college literally ignoring everything and justifying my ego in my mind, I started therapy cuz of this in 2nd sem isolation but it helped me justify this behaviour even more and I was even happy in that time thinking all of this is perfect.  \nFast forward to current in 3rd sem, he also went off to college and unlike me he’s pretty social so we drifted, apart from this a lot of stuff bout academics began to fall apart too so there was one line of defence bout studies and smartness falling apart. And it after we drifted like completely in around sept the second line of defence bout one friend fell apart. And thus this entire mindset I built collapses and I have no idea what’s going around me or like how I have ruined my life, thousands of thoughts coming to my mind. Started different therapy now.  \nTherapy and all the loneliness just made it realise how I have prevented myself to change and enjoy life all along the last 7 years, it’s not the introvertness but the anxiety that stopped me, some of my best memories are at a school trip or with people or partying yet how do I saw I never enjoy those?  \nDamn this shits hard af to write, I feel like I know myself completely now but this is also a sign of living in my mind and overthinking so I’m toning that down too and just focusing on breaking this ego I have created in my mind.",

That's why I'm already thinking that audio will be the least consuming, since images require a lot of preparation, and text requires breathing space and focus, which has been very difficult in this situation.\n\nProbably my mistake is is trying to prioritize the record over the change itself and wanting to do something perfect when changing habits requires dealing with fluctuations.\n\nAnyway, how did you do it?

      "selftext": "I was reading through a thread the other day and was shocked at the seeming lack of understanding one poster seemed to have. But it's easy to forget that we all start from zero understanding, and some folks just happen to be taking their very first steps on a particular path. \n\nWhen we encounter someone further back on the path than we are we might ignore them, or shrug or even scoff. But a lack of perspective or knowledge is entirely normal (for everyone, on every topic, at some stage in their life). \n\nMore importantly, regardless of how much we learn, this gap is never entirely filled. And, for most, the negative knowledge space is far greater than the knowledge we have. Yet people often focus or fixate on how much they know as opposed to how much more they don't. \n\nThis leads us to sometimes view others (who may know less or different than us) as lacking, being less or being different. And this cognitive skew doesn't just impact our view of others but also of ourselves. Eg I think I'm smart. I think I know a lot. But I only know what I know and I usual forget or ignore how much I don't know. \n\nSuggested takeaway: we should try every day to view this not as 'negative space' but instead as blank canvas. \n\nThe massive area that represent all we (or others) don't yet know is not something to be ignored or scoffed at, it's opportunity. It represent future knowledge and understanding.",

      "selftext": "Before some of you pass out, bear with me for a moment.\n\nNone of us is entitled to get what we want. Even when we put in all the effort that it takes, there is still a factor of luck and destiny that plays a role.  \nHere in the first world we are proportionally so used to getting what we want that we totally forget all the other people who will never even get the chance to see or experience what we think is a standard.\n\nThat is why we really have to keep in mind, whenever it comes to great relationships, a fulfilling job, or a healthy body, that there are factors over which we have no control.\n\nSome people are born into poverty, others into wealth. For one personality it is a blessing to be born into wealth, for others it is the reason why they fall from the roof of a skyscraper.\n\nAt the end of the day we have to be realistic about the fact that no matter how much effort we put in, there is just no guarantee that we come out at the place we wish to end up.\n\nBut here is the good news: There are things we can do to minimize the factor of luck and destiny or even let it play into our favor. Below you will find my three personal favorites to do that.\n\n**Become radically grateful and accept every event as an assignment.** Everything that you are allowed to experience is either a lesson or a gift from above. Do not see anything as personal or bad luck. You will meet the wrong people again and again until you have learned a lesson life is trying to teach you. You will experience the same things again and again until the lesson is understood and learned. Do not constantly wish for change, but show what you desire by daily gratitude and relentless action. Life will give you more of the things you are grateful for and the things you prove progress for.\n\n**In a world that feeds on negativity, you stand out by rejecting the lust for anger and hate.** If you decide to stay calm, focused, and kind when others lost their last nerves a long time ago, life can make a dramatic turn tomorrow already. It is one big decision today and many micro decisions from tomorrow on. Does this mean you always have to be nice? Obviously the most respected people have the potential to be cruel, but only as a means of self-defense or executing a morally necessary step. Be like a warrior in a garden and not like a gardener in a war.\n\n**Get your -self- in order.** Let go of the idea that your body and you are one entity. Your body is the vehicle you operate with its own rules and needs. Read into Carl Jung's model of the psyche and work on it. Everything that happened in the past has influence on your present. Some of these events had a positive influence. Others corrupt your life until today. The more you get your heart and soul to open up and separate you from the -self-, the more you will be able to partner up with luck and destiny.\n\nIt is never too late to turn things around. Tomorrow could be the first day of the rest of your life.",

      "selftext": "I used to struggle to express my words despite having so much to talk about and share with everyone. I kept thinking that I was incredibly profound but as I begin to express myself, I realized I was just confused and afraid of being judged.\n\nHere are the 3 tips I used to get more articulate and confident when speaking:\n\n1) Intentional Pausing: I noticed that if I just paused and let out my words slower, they would come out much more sharper and I would be able to express myself much better. If you speak immediately you do not give yourself time to use the words you might even have in your mind. You stick to the default ones. Start pausing more and tampering with your pacing until you refine it to something that works for you.\n\n2) Storytelling: I noticed that some of the most captivating and inspiring people had so many stories to share and observed that it had such a persuasive and powerful impact on other people. So I started to look for events and funny occurances in my daily life no matter how trivial they might seem to me. I eventually got to a point where I could make a story out of nothing. The action step is to do this everyday and look for what amused you that particular day then say it out loud in your own words.\n\n3) Practice: The old adage of practice makes perfect still stands ever golden and true. Give your mind the chance to habitualize and get into a familiar environment by practicing talking to the mirror, out loud to yourself when you want to express something or in front of camera. This will have a significant affect on your speaking skills and make you a better speaker in general. Get used to hearing your own voice, even if it feels weird.",

      "selftext": "This post is to share with my best intent how a genuine hunger for answers can actually lead you to them.\n\nMany people spend a long time convincing themselves that time will heal, time will tell, or time will reveal. While that’s true in some cases, there are others who simply can’t move on without clarity.\n\nI’m not saying that everything in life has to make sense but the things that truly stir us often deserve our attention and a bit of digging. When you start exploring and investigating with the pure intention of finding answers and learning, they come to you faster than you ever imagined they would if you hadn’t tried to help yourself.\n\nI love something Believers (those who believe in God) often say: *“What happens, happens for the good. You may not see it now, but you’ll understand later.”*\n\nSimilarly, spiritual people who aren’t necessarily religious say something along the same lines: *“Trust that everything is happening in your favor.”* It’s also one of the most common ideas in the realm of Law of Attraction practices.\n\nWhat I’ve come to realize is that when you truly want an answer and stay focused on finding it-  you eventually do. And when you do, you’ll often laugh at yourself, not out of regret or sadness, but with a light heart because suddenly, everything starts to make sense. Situations that once felt unfair or confusing begin to reveal their purpose.\n\nI say most situations because I’m not trying to dismiss the deep pain of loss, death, or the trauma caused by heinous acts. Those deserve their own space and compassion.\n\nIn the end, I just want to say — trust that it’s all unfolding for your highest good.\nWhether you place that trust in God, yourself, or even in nothingness, know that you’re being protected in ways you can’t yet see. The situations that feel negative right now may actually be redirecting you toward something better.\n\nEverything truly happens for your highest good. What’s meant to stay will feel right - it will flow, not fight. And what’s not meant to, will leave, even if it has to be torn away with force. Probably, the wisdom lies not in control but management of your reaction and responses that eventually will lead you to *finding your WHYs*. ",

Oftentimes people have just told me “Life’s not that serious.”\n\nI feel frustrated. I’m not too sure how to relax anymore than I’ve learned to now.

Like where is the line when I’m becoming just as big of a bully? Is it really fair to be mean just because she is? I don’t want to be this way but I get so worked up about it and I know it’s an unhealthy cycle and I know it gets my dopamine going in a bad way. Like when someone is hateful and wrong like that I just have this insane need to call them out on it. I said something incorrect very confidently (and in kind of a mean way) and I’m embarrassed. Embarrassed of this whole thing. I’m posting this to ask 1) Why am I so bothered by wrong and mean people, 2) How can I stop acting like this, and 3) Am I a bad person for all this??

If not what did you do?\n\nThese are the main groupings I can think of if anyone can help, thanks!\n\n* 1. **Medical**: \n   * Vitamins\n   * Hormones\n   * Thyroid\n   * Blood sugar\n   * Allergies\n   * Blood count\n   * Sleep apnoea\n   * Gut/gluten\n   * Lyme disease\n   * Heart disease\n   * Diabetes\n   * Toxins\n\n\n\n* 2. **Lifestyle**:\n   * Increase exercise\n   * Decrease exercise (overtraining)\n   * Alcohol reduction\n   * Weight loss\n   * Smoking cessation\n   * Caffeine reduction/cessation\n   * Diet change\n\n\n\n* 3. **Psychological**:\n   * ADHD/autism\n   * Depression\n   * Anxiety\n\n\n\n* 4. **Life**:\n   * Burn-out\n   * Fulfilment\n   * Improve relationships/connection\n   * Reduce stress\n   * Improve finances\n   * External life factors are to blame, it's not something you can change\n\n",

      "selftext": "Today is a reminder that your mental health matters. Mental health is just as important as physical health. Taking care of your mind is not a luxury — it’s a necessity.\n\nWe live in a world that often tells us to keep pushing, to stay strong, to keep smiling even when it hurts. But real strength is learning to slow down, to rest, to ask for help when your heart and mind feel heavy.\n\nTaking care of your mind is not weakness — it’s healing, it’s growth, it’s love for yourself, and it’s part of honoring the life that God has given you.\n\nHere are a few things that help me (and maybe they’ll help you too):\n\n1. Prioritize rest. Allow yourself to pause, unplug, and recharge — your body and mind need recovery.\n\n2. Talk about your feelings. Opening up to someone you trust can bring healing and connection.\n\n3. Move your body. Exercise releases endorphins and helps reduce stress and anxiety.\n\n4. Practice gratitude. Focusing on the positives helps shift your mindset and build resilience.\n\n5. Set boundaries. Protect your peace by saying “no” when you need to.\n\n6. Seek help when you need it. Therapy, support groups, or simply talking to a friend can make a world of difference.\n\nIf you’re struggling, please know that you’re not alone. There is hope, there is help, and there are brighter days ahead. \n\nLet’s continue to check in on each other, show grace, and break the silence around mental health.\n\nTake care of your heart, your mind, and your spirit — you are worthy of peace, healing, and joy. 💚\n\n",

I feel stuck in this weird in-between place where I want to be better, but I don’t really know where to start.\n\nI want to be more like myself around strangers instead of constantly holding back. I want to stop feeling scared of being who I actually am. I want to meet people and build the kind of life that feels genuine, one where I actually feel proud of who I’m becoming.\n\nIf anyone has been through something similar, how did you start?

      "selftext": "Yesterday I finally took the first step, manifesting my dream and taking a bath, which for me is a first step considering the amount of willpower, strength and energy it took for me to fight the fatigueness, the urge to do nothing at all and wake up. I had a small (big) gaming session after because I think I deserve it (even though I don't), since I finally took the first step after years of contemplating and procrastinating it.\n\nIt's going to be a very lonely life hereafter, how it always was. No friends, no partner, no support from family or siblings fighting against my worst enemy, my lifetime rival, the one who ruined my life, made me the depressed (etc...) f I am now, the one who made me do all the mistakes I deeply regret ever doing, the one who took away everything from me even the very little respect everyone had for me, myself. \n\nThe odds of me winning is very rare but not zero - **not zero**. Though **it** had consumed every part of me, there is still a bit part of me left, who still has hope left, who still believes in me, who was fighting day and night for years for me to take the first step, and now has enough strength and power to fight back against my evil self. Even though it's still not enough, it's waiting for me to take the next step to get the power to fight back more intensely but I'm tired, fatigued, not motivated, not energetic enough (etc...), how it was yesterday and everyday before that but somehow I was able to take the first step yesterday, **I can do it today as well, and hereafter**. Else my evil self will consume the very little better part of me left. \nI might've tackled it yesterday and today (hope so) but I'm not sure how I'm going to do it till the end of me comes. But I guess having a little hope won't hurt. Everyday is different, everyday is a different struggle, everyday I have to create different strategies to fight those struggles, I can't give up - not anymore. I've given up enough, I've procrastinated enough. Its right time that I finally start doing it - being better. \n\nNext step is opening up a book and study even if it is for a few minutes. To be more realistic with myself, I'm going to be setting goals that I know I can do.  My goals are to make friends (or a friend) preferably online cause irl is not built for me tbh, get some new hobbies and interests, bring back my long lost passion, score really good in my final exam that I get into a good reputed college with the degree I love. Tbh I don't really have much going on in my life. I mean I'm either at school or at my home. I'm barely outside and there's nothing for me to do at my house either other than scrolling, sleeping or studying. I'm lost on how I can change this but Ig I could at least learn time management (first) and that could be considered 'being better' or 'starting over'\n\nI'm just looking for the most advice I can get. I'm lost, I don't know what to do and I have no one to ask this to. I'm sorry if this was long and that I wasted your time, I put everything into writing this post and it means a lot to me\n\nThanks for reading till the end. I appreciate you giving your time. Tc ",

Which is another thing, I'm polyamorus and have discovered that recently and that has fueled this fire to a burning blaze cause what if in wrongly accused of cheating just because I am poly. Also I do talk to minors, and an friends with a couple so that's another contender on why I might be falsy accused of something.I know how these channels function at this point. So how do I get out of this loop of negativity and start loving my friends and myself again?

Im having anxiety and panic attacks again. I cant eat, sleep etc. seriously what do i do about this situation?

This guy has no fuckin shame that he still uses work as an excuse to call me and text me while we are at work (btw he texts in the work number and not my personal number as i blocked him everywhere) .The context is work but ik he calls just to hear my voice. He comes to my desk with some random documents which may not be urgent or could have been send through someone else but he uses it as a chance to interact with me. Whereas i try to send any document i have through someone else , i know this isn’t professional and i have to keep personal things aside and behave normally at work but i just hate that fact that he waits to see me or get any chance to talk to me. If i could i would cover myself like a cocoon whenever i have to face him so he wont get to see me as he literally checks me out all the fuckin time he is near me …. 🤢\nHe is such a lazy person and never moves from his desk and a person like that frequently visiting where i sit now( i sit on a different floor and he has to come down taking stairs) is just him doing everything possible to see me ik that and its disgusting me to my bones. A married man fuckin doing this…. Does he even like that girl.. i pity her. Anyhow she chose this!\nThe fact that he doesnt care about how the shit he does affects me mentally and im still in the process of getting better. Its like he had a memory loss of how miserable he made my life. Ik the reason why he is so shameless cos in his life his actions had no after effects except for me exiting his life, that girl accepted him and he thinks its okay to do anything he pleases and everyone will tolerate it.. whereas i am here who was happily single until i met him , i started dreaming of marriage and after what he did i hate the entire existence of men! I do not know how long i will take to get out of this..\nI hate myself for being stuck in this situation. Im not in a position to leave this job until i find another one. Can someone just tell me how do i avoid him. Should i just tell him on his face to not come to me anymore using work as an excuse. Pls help 😭😭\n",

We pause, we ramble, we miss commas.\n\n2. Imperfection = authenticity.\nOne typo or filler word (“kinda”, “honestly”) can make your tone more real.\n\n3. Reddit’s filters detect “polish,” not intent.\nSo a heartfelt post might look more suspicious than spam.\n\nIn a weird way, it taught me something:\nDon’t try to sound perfect. Try to sound alive.\n\nHas anyone else ever had a post flagged for being “too AI”?",

Is it sustainable to always have endless panic inducing thoughts? Is it healthy to associate with your thoughts to the extent that they completely drive your mood?\n\nFocus is the answer. Practice sitting with yourself, it is completely free. At first, it will be hard you will be practically be getting riddled with lots of thoughts. As you begin to get good at it, you will notice a difference in your energy levels and start to get very calm.\n\nThe best way to start doing it is to do low cognitive tasks that are slow and require less or no cognitive energy like washing your clothes, arranging your room. \n\nThis will set you up for success. It certainly made me a much better person when I started doing this, it is not that I don't struggle with it sometimes. But overall, my quality of life improved exponentially.",

      "selftext": "I’m just going to speed recap this untold story in hopes it eve gets traction. \n\nI’m 31. Been in 4 relationships the last 10 years, totaling 8.5/10 of the years. First one was 3 years of emotional turmoil and unnecessary difficulty while I learned to trust my gut/when to exit and see unhealthy relationships. Second and third were shorter than a year each, while learning what I’m looking for in a partner I guess, (this is all NOT what my goal was going into them, I was just sleeping around and would get attached to somebody with qualities i admired, and I ended both of them when it became glaringly obvious I had misjudged the compatibility but still jumped in head first to the relationship. Met my most recent long term relationship (and now EX gf) the same way, but maybe a few days slower while I made a pathetic attempt to avoid sleeping with her immediately as to avoid my habit of immediately ‘wearing blinders’ and missing significant signs of incompatibility. They were there. And although it was the first healthy positive example of a successful dynamic I had been able to achieve, the signs popped back up constantly, and finally refused to be covered up, micro-managed, of ignored any further. \n\nFirst time i had been broken up wiyj. 3 years and almost 8 months, and I prefer to take a  hefty mount of blame for allowing the relationship to start we quickly in the first place. \n\nSo I’m alone, I know I hide important differences in others from myself and jump to quickly into commitment, without getting to know the person, or letting them know me, \n\nGo to a ‘singles meet’ arranged on the app meetup, promising myself I willl not hide my intentions, I will find what I want honestly l, and I will be completely transparent, knowing I have work to do on myself before another hefty partnership. Meet a girl who isn’t sharing much about herself, seems very emotionally aware and in touch, and we both want and are open to a fwb situation, so we swear that by continuing, no relationship can ever be a possibility or option for us, as to  completely remove the roadblock of false infatuation, \n\nTwo separate weekends, two sleepovers and plenty of late night conversations, I have a crush on her of course. So I’m transparent, I have to be. And I have to at least allow her to end it knowing I’m developing feeling, so I tell her, and I ask her opinion. She liked me in return, but is hesitant becaaaaaaause; \n\nSHE SEES THE PATTERN, I SEE THE PATTERN, she knows enough of my history now, and it’s a hard thing to not notice, my constant relationship status and my speed of moving on from my most prior.  We agree to go out separate ways, date others, and reconnect after 6 months. \n\nI start diving into why I always need to be in a relationship, my patterns, my rejection fears, my dads constant bitterness and how I could feel it from miles away, and I knew he was coming to tell me I had not done enough around the house that day. \n\nI remembered how every one of my friends in school that I grew close to, eventually told me they did not want me to keep hanging out with them, or I was constantly bullied by other kids, being I was very hyperactive, and always attracting the negative attention. Each blow lands a little less harder than the first,\n\nI meet my first gf, she shows me I can feel needed and important, and she also sees how important that is for me, and uses it easily against me, either unintentionally or not \n\nI realize going over these events recently I’ve done my best to ignore my fears of “never being truly known and loved for it, so I have hidden that aspect of myself within a very confident demeanor from every partner. \n\nMe and the girl I met most recently aren’t trying too hard to not make plans together, \nI’m aware of what’s happening, and I just want to feel loved . \n\nSo I tell her what I found out about myself and my patterns. (Because im completely transparent and honest) and because we both are well aware of how we broke every rule, and I at least know that I have no intention or the willpower to back away. \nI tell her:\n\nIm embarrassed  how much I want to feel wanted, by someone, but it’s who I am currently, and that’s just, unfortunately where I’m at still. \n\nOf course, she didn’t sign up for this. \nShe said she’ll text me tomorrow, I’m really over here telling myself she’ll be into how straight foreward and honest I’ve been. How crazy is that??\n\nFrom the outside it obviously looks like I’m a crazy person, ready for a FWB situation, suddenly cutting himself off of such a rad arrangement, suddenly wanting to pursue a relationship, but willing to not sleep with her for months, and then turning to her and saying: I’m absolutely so terrified of people not ever wanting me around, I’ve become practiced and dedicated towards ng term relationship commitment to stove off my insecurity, and have mot been completely stopping myself in our situation  \n\n\nHow cooked am I? Do I need a mental hospital? \nShe has all the info, if she wants to continue with me, I’m free of potential fault? If she doesn’t, cheers to her for getting away from this, I’m exhausting to myself. Please discuss what I’m doing to my brain currently. Is it similar to re-frying a bean?\n\nDiscuss please  why I am thinking she would ever see this through\n\nExplain to me that my deep seated fear is true, and I knew what I was doing, and the all the steps I was taking to seduce her, and suck her into my story and emotional adventure? and keep her here with my while I ‘find myself’\n\n\n\n\n",

The environment at the job was awful and toxic (my entire department went from an operations team to a full time call center without any warning). I was there for about two years. There was a lot of gaslighting, miscommunication, micromanaging, and the department leaders acted like it was a classroom rather than an office. \n\nAfter quitting, I finally had a chance to catch my breath and reflect. I noticed I was such a different person. Negative all around, mood swings, complaining and just anxious as hell. I have improved some things already. I'm working out now and my posture has tremendously improved. I'm also set to begin therapy soon. However, I still feel so strange. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice on how to move forward? ",

      "selftext": "I’ve made a lot of progress the last few years on correcting my finances, realigning my career goals, improving my happiness, and functioning better on a day to day basis. But I feel genuinely stuck sometimes on insecurity and held back by my own sense of inferiority and I don’t know how to fix it.\n\nFor context I’ve struggled with this since I was a kid. I don’t know where it comes from because it’s just always been there. I’ve always had really intense waves of fear and I’ve never felt comfortable showing it to others. I “performed” perfection - I remember seeking constant approval for my grades, for my calmness, for my art, etc. But there was turmoil on the inside and it just got worse the older I got. I was in medicated and in therapy before high school for panic attacks.\n\nI think as an adult my anxiety has translated into a sense that I cannot be worthy (of love, money, opportunity, etc) exactly as I am. I can only be worthy if I am better. And being in relationships or even studying in college has often felt like taking out a loan against the universe in the hope that if I grow enough and become good enough it will be paid. This is how I ended up in a domestic violence situation when I was 19. It was built on a lack of self-love and a feeling that, although I didn’t deserve to be hurt, I also didn’t deserve better. After that relationship I had a series of long-term casual relationships, not because I didn’t want love, but because I was just afraid to let anyone love me. I felt like if they got too close to me they would only see everything “wrong” with me.\n\nAnyway, a lot has changed. I’ve gone back to therapy. I’ve worked immensely on my trauma and triggers. I’ve come to terms with things that I saw before as failures and in the last year and a half I’ve grown exponentially. Work opportunities, regaining financial security. I take good care of my body. I’m happy more days than I’m not. I love myself more than I used to. I’m grateful I got to heal and move forward.\n\nI feel like it’s easy to make progress toward a sense of self-love when other things in my life are going exceptionally right. But when things are moving steadily and life slows down it kind of just catches up to me. I still treat myself like a project and base my self-perception on things outside of myself. \n\nRecently I moved to a new city for a promotion and I’m finding this coming back up. It feels impossible to make friends. And dating or pursuing any kind of connection is something I’ve lost interest in. I think that comes from still not being comfortable letting people near enough to see me. I want to change it.\n\nSorry for the long post but maybe someone here can understand and offer some advice.",

I don’t really believe in online dating anymore, and in real life I rarely meet anyone new. Most of my friends are married or have kids, and although we still talk, it’s not the same.\n\nI do go out, I train regularly, I talk to people — it’s not that I’m isolated. I just don’t know how to connect anymore. Especially with men.\n\nAnd lately, I’ve been feeling like I’m somehow behind. Like not having a job or a relationship means I’m failing at being an adult.\nSometimes I even feel like a fraud — like I’m not really living, just existing.\n\nAnd that’s what scares me the most — that I’ll end up watching my life go by instead of actually living it, and waste it all on nothing.\n\nHas anyone else felt this way? How do you start feeling alive again when everything seems to have slowed down around you?",

But it feels like because of these relationships, I am very reluctant to try again with anyone. As it's rare to find a secure person. Most seem unwilling to do the work to heal their traumas, or most don't even realize the work they need to do.\n\nAnd a part of me, misses that excitement you feel when dating, getting to know someone.\n\nI have been on a few dates and involved romantically this past year and half. But they quickly fizzle out. \n\nA part of me knows it may not always be like this, with the ebb and flow of energy in life.\n\nJust a query I am curious about with what others may do.\n\nThanks for reading this far ",

As someone who's battled these issues for 20+ years, here's what I wish a wiser parent figure had taught me:\n\n1. The \"if/then\" contingency planning method for procrastination. Example: \"IF I feel the urge to check social media, THEN I will do 5 push-ups first.\" Simple implementation intentions reduced my procrastination by 70%.\n2. The \"impossible day\" technique. One day per week, I tackle ONLY the tasks I've been avoiding. This prevents avoidance backlog from growing.\n3. The \"identity-first\" approach to habits. Instead of \"I need to exercise,\" I decided \"I am someone who moves daily.\" This subtle shift eliminated the internal debate.\n4. The \"previous day close-out\" ritual. Taking 20 seconds at day's end to organize tomorrow eliminates decision fatigue and morning paralysis. I turn a 7 second voice message into full plan. For anyone interested, I left the tool in my profile.\n5. The \"ugly method\" approach to perfectionism. For first drafts/attempts, I deliberately do things poorly to overcome starting resistance. Quality can be added later.\n\nThese aren't flashy techniques you'll see from 22-year-old influencers. They're battle-tested methods that survived contact with real adult responsibilities. What productivity challenges are you currently facing?\n\n",

I need something with notifications and integrations and all that. Finally I was so frustrated I just grabbed a cheap notebook (I think it was $3 or $4, one of those dotted ones) and started writing my daily tasks there. Just a list, nothing fancy\n\nAnd idk, it just clicked?Something about using a pencil for writing it makes me actually think about what's important instead of just dumping everything into an app, the best also is I avoid distractionss. Also I can't get notifications or multi tasking and I can take to the park without actually taking the phone, I spent more time looking into the trees rather than reading my notifs\n\nThe way I do it now is pretty simple, in the morning I take like 5 minutes, open to a fresh page, write the date, and write down 3 intentions. if they are big items then I break each one into smaller steps to progress faster and being abel to complete. in the night I do a check of what I finished and what not, I try to just not judge as there are days that looks like shit, just to be aware and keep track. in a few weeks I was abel to track some patterns and usually it involves a common theme around the day and avoid multi tasking!\n\nI still use some apps for work stuff like tasks, even try my build my own just for fun , but for my own planning I just use the notebook now. Been doing it for a few months and i just get getting more done\n\nAnyone else going through this process of de-technologization? Like trying all the fancy tools and then going back to basics?\n\nJust wanted to share in case anyone else is stuck in the app-hopping cycle like I was. I hope this post don't get downvoted and we can have some real conversation here!",

      "selftext": "For a very long time, I tried to live like everyone else. Waking up early, doing some fancy morning routine, exercising, meditating, you know the drill.\n\nIt felt like I was finally becoming productive. I time-blocked my day: work, exercise, rest, etc. But every time I did that, after a few weeks of following the schedule, it always started to drift. I’d go to sleep later, wake up later, things wouldn’t fit into the schedule anymore, I’d start ignoring some plans, then completely abandon it and go back to feeling guilty.\n\nIt went on like this until I got fired from my job because of poor performance.\n\nAnd since I suddenly had a lot of free time, I decided to seriously look into what was wrong. That’s when I found out about chronotypes.\n\nTurns out it’s scientifically proven that people actually have different sleep patterns and productive hours. Roughly half the population has an evening chronotype, meaning it’s normal for them to fall asleep late and be more productive later in the day compared to what society expects. And I was an evening type.\n\nSo I decided to stop pushing against my biology and adapt to it instead. I started tracking my sleep with my watch and focused on sleep quality instead of the exact time I went to bed. I learned that having a consistent sleep schedule is more important than trying to force myself to sleep early.\n\nSince I was unemployed, I had the freedom to try a bunch of things. One of them was super simple: do work when I felt most productive. For me, that was in the evening. And for the first time, I didn’t feel guilty about it. I noticed I was able to get more done in less time. I also felt better, and the joy of creating things came back.\n\nBut sometimes, my productive hours still felt a bit random. Like one time I was getting groceries and suddenly had a bunch of work ideas. It felt like I was wasting my peak hours.\n\nAs a software engineer, I decided to fix that.\n\nI took my watch data and looked for any correlations with my subjective productive hours. After about a month of experimenting, I built an algorithm that predicted my energy levels with scary accuracy.\n\nI had a designer friend with the same problem, so he tried my energy prediction algorithm.He was so impressed that he designed an app concept around it.\n\nThat shift, just letting myself work with my energy instead of against it, is what actually led me to finally do something that I always wanted.",

      "selftext": "Hi guys. Not sure what to introduce myself with tbh, But I'm a 24 year old who works in a retail store in the UK, around 30 hours a week or so. I don't hate it, but it's not my dream and my failure to move on from an entry-level job that a 16 year old can turn up and do is a source of pretty much constant frustration to me. However, these are not directly relevant to my post so I'll park these for now.\n\nBecause of a change with the company I work for, I have change from doing a vary of shifts (normally like 11pm-6pm or whatever) that occupy the bulk of my day and give me a limited amount of time to do other things with my day. to shifts that start at 7am and finish at the latest 1pm. I thought i'd prefer it as the earlier you finish work, the more time you have to relax and do things you enjoy after work. In reality, I've been very bored and it has made me feel very sad about how I perceive my life.\n\nIt's not like I don't do anything. I go to the gym around 3 times a week, swim and play golf as well as attend football games as a regular social activity. However, what used to appear to be a lot of things going on in my life, now feels like practically nothing when I have an additional half of a day to play with. I think part of it, is how lonely I am, I am single and I always have been and although I have friends, it isn't the type of friendship where we see each other every day and are readily available to keep each other occupied at all times. I'm spending more and more time in front of the TV at a loose end and finding myself increasingly disilussioned with my life.\n\nI guess why I'm posting this, is I would like any advice I could get on making what should be an enjoyable perk of my life (most people would kill to finish at 1pm every day and I recognise this) into an enjoyable perk . Should I find additional hobbies, put some effort into trying to get a girlfriend. I'm just a little stumped on how to take advantage of this and would appreciate some advice, especially from those with a similar work/life schedule.\n\nThanks for any comments in advance.",

      "selftext": "This feels like such a weird question to ask, but I don't know how else to phrase it.\n\nI've struggled with Depression and ADHD for most of my life, but I didn't really treat it until I was \\~20 in college. I had the mindset that I shouldn't need medications to \"feel/act normal.\" I recently turned 29, and I'm glad I changed my mind then. I genuinely think my life has ultimately been better because of it.\n\nHowever, I've been struggling for at least the past year on finding things that make me \"happy.\" I feel like the hobbies/activities I've been doing for most of my life (ie. video games since forever, playing and painting miniatures for 40k and similar games since I was 15, playing magic the gathering since a few years ago, etc) don't actually make me feel \"happy\" anymore.\n\nI don't really look forward to doing them, and I'm not really excited/happy while doing them. It almost feels like I do them now when I have nothing else to do. Some hobbies I've taken an \"undetermined hiatus\" from altogether (ie. I haven't touched a paintbrush in half a year).   \n  \nThis has been a feeling I think I've struggled with even before medications. I don't think I've personally felt true excitement on the thought of doing something I think I'd enjoy doing. I see how people light up with certain topics or future events.. I don't think I can say I've felt that. At least in a VERY long time.\n\nI've tried changing things up (ie. painting new things or trying new mediums, trying new games or styles of playing certain games) but it's ultimately the same conclusion.. I'm just not excited or happy to do them, and I'm struggling to find things that actually give me that happiness or excitement that \"normal\" people feel.\n\nSo... how do you do it? How did you find out what makes you happy? What would you say to someone like me who's struggling to find that?",

It’s about feeling like you’re never enough, no matter what you do. It steals joy from your work, peace from your rest, and confidence from your growth.\n\nIf this sounds like you, try searching “perfectionism” on YouTube, TikTok, or Instagram.

For the past few years I feel like I've slowly started to care less and less about the feelings of others, and it's pretty much crashing down on me now how destructive I've really been.\n\nLike yeah sure I've got Autism and Anxiety and a few other bits and pieces going on in my head, but that's no excuse for my behaviour. I've noticed constantly that I put my own wishes and desires before others and I don't want to do that anymore. I really want to be a better person not just for myself but for the people around me as well.\n\nSo yeah, I feel like I need help. Because I feel like if I just do this all myself I'll convince myself of continuing to be the destructive person I feel like I've always been, and I don't want that anymore, I want to do better.",

My ADHD brain saw that, panicked, and opened Reddit instead.\n\nThe shift: Tasks need to be embarrassingly small\n\nI used to write \"Work on project\" and wonder why I never started.\n\nNow I write:\n\n* Open laptop\n* Open project folder\n* Look at one file\n* Change one line\n* Close laptop\n\nFive completed micro-tasks feel better than one abandoned big task.\n\nWhat to do when stuck (the part nobody talks about)\n\nBefore: Stare at task for 3 hours, accomplish nothing, feel terrible\n\nNow when executive dysfunction hits:\n\n1. Make it 50% smaller\n2. Still stuck? Make it 50% smaller again\n3. Still stuck? Do literally any other productive thing\n4. Still stuck? Rest without guilt\n\nThe revelation: Being stuck isn't failure, it's information.\n\nThe 4-hour limit that changed everything\n\nI used to plan 8-hour productive days. By Tuesday I'd burn out, by Thursday I'd quit entirely.\n\nNow: 4 hours maximum of focused work per day.\n\nSounds like less but it's actually more: 4 hours x 7 days > 8 hours x 2 days then crashing.\n\nWhat this actually looks like\n\n**Month 1:** One goal, broken into daily 10-minute tasks **Month 2:** Same goal until it's automatic **Month 3:** Added second goal only after first was habit **Month 6:** Three goals maximum, all with micro-tasks\n\nProgress is embarrassingly slow by normal standards. But it's still progress, which beats my previous pattern of sprint-crash-quit-shame-repeat.\n\nThe mental shifts that mattered\n\n\"I should be able to focus for hours\" → \"My limit is my limit\"\n\n\"Break it down into steps\" → \"Break it down until it's laughably small\"\n\n\"Push through when stuck\" → \"Stuck means stop and reassess\"\n\n\"I'm behind everyone\" → \"I'm ahead of yesterday me\"\n\nStill have ADHD. Still get distracted. But for the first time in my life, I'm actually completing things instead of just starting them.\n\n**What task have you been avoiding because it feels too big to start?**",

At work ive around 5 tasks that take around max 2 hours, and even that became so exhausting i stopped doing anything at work. Which followed by horrible diet, at home i feel so exhausted i just doom scroll, until i feel like i wanna vomit and become overstimulated. At work, every customer makes me so angry, smallest details i feel rage, at home and at work. Ive became bitter, lazy, exhausted, unmotivated and so sensitive. \nToday at work i almost had a panic attack but i needed to hold it in and cried just a bit to go back to work, i work alone everyday which makes it so easy to overthink. \nI dropped any exercise because i dont feel like it, i just lay down when im off, not even thrifting makes me happy for long. \nI cant afford a burnout because i dont make enough financially, i looked at other job options but i feel this horrible feeling and dread that i cannot do it. Everything feels sluggish and i slowly feel detached from this world, keeping my emotions inside makes me feel so shaky and im on the edge of having a full breakdown. This isnt the first time im going through something like this, i had moments where id to chores at home and needing to stop because i just had to cry it out for hours. \nI just need some replies that can relate and advice on what you guys do in such moments to come out from this. Each time this happens its like i completely forget what can really help and get me out. ",

And when I do, it’s either: \n\n1) Going after the wrong women who string me along, never commit bc I don’t seem like a serious option to date. Maybe I’m attracted to avoidant people? \n\n2) I hate this word but getting “friendzoned” bc  I give off platonic energy. I’ve had some success with flirting though but it’s happened only 20% of the time. Realistically, I feel like give off Softy and not enough sexual energy. \n\nWhen it comes to friends, I feel like I crave a sense of brotherhood. I have some guy friends but we’re not super close and when we hang out I don’t feel fulfilled? it’s either just playing games or going to bar/raves. \n\nAnd it’s harder to make friends out of college.

I feel kind of lonely sometimes because I can’t kick it back with “the boys.” \n\nIt just feels like I’m in a weird cross-roads where I don’t really fit in anywhere and it makes me feel lonely.\n\nOne of my regrets was not being friends with more men when I was a bit younger so maybe then I’d be normal.\n\nAny advice?

I grew up literally sometimes punching my parents in the face when they tried to wake me for kindergarten/school as a young kid, and although i got that under control, i am still insufferable right after waking up! \n\nI am usually a cheerful, loving person that is always full of energy, but apparrently i turn into a monster when woken.\nI live with my partner, whom i absolutely love and adore. They usually wake up earlier than me, thus waking me for breakfast, but instead of getting up i will angrily grunt at them, be mad that they woke me, push them away when they they to cuddle me and be overall just be rather hostile. When they have breakfast alone i will then be angry that they ate without me, so there really is no winning.\n\nIt breaks my heart that i am like this since it is nothing like me and i can't imagine how it must feel to be met with such behavior and rejection first thing in the morning, so i really need to change, but i am literally half asleep and not really aware of my actions in that state, often i just fall right asleep again and don't even remember much.\nI also need more sleep than my partner so getting up earlier is not a great option since i already go to sleep earlier- I wish i could somehow just be happy and loving even when i am still half asleep.\nMy Partner is great and understanding, but they don't deserve to be treated like this. \n\nHow do you all cope with this? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",

      "selftext": "Let me first just sort of say, I know this sounds super privileged. I would say I am pretty solidly middle class, and my adventuring is largely due to either me working a whole lot to earn extra money, or I schemed to be able to the adventuring for free/cheap. I've generally found how I can actually ski/scuba/travel for pretty darn cheap (or I splurge with funds from a part-time job).\n\nBut... I feel sort of bored and lonely a lot of the time. I work as a school teacher during the year, but I always want to be doing some sort of adventuring/traveling/extreme activity. The past couple of summers I was a leader for study abroad trips overseas... total blast. I also worked for a bit as a scuba instructor... again total blast. I loved all the people I met through these experiences and the different places I saw (even if some of the day to days could also be grinds). Also, in my town, I work with some local festivals which is fun but at the end of the day, they are only a few days a year.\n\nBut I... sort of feel like I don't really fit in with very suburb USA, doing the same thing over and over again. But teaching does give me a few months off that other jobs don't provide. I am either working a bunch of side hustles to pay for my adventuring, or I sort of feel like I am just sort of waiting for the next trip or activity.\n\nIn college when I was bored and restless like this, I would go for late night walks through campus/the downtown college area and honestly, I always felt that helped a lot. But... it's a couple of miles through suburbia to get to anything interesting to walk around at (and they are strangely dead anyways).",

      "selftext": " I've always been a chronic procrastinator (hello fellow \"due tomorrow = do tomorrow\" gang 👋). I tried everything - pomodoro, website blockers and even meditation. Nothing works in the long run. But about 2 months ago, I started doing somthing that actually changed things for me.\n\nI began keeping a \"procrastination journal\" (sounds stupid, I know, but hear me out). Every time I caught myself procrastinating, I'd quickly jot down:\n\n* What I was supposed to be doing\n* What I was doing instead (usually scrolling Reddit or watching yt shorts)\n* How I was feeling in that moment\n\nAnd then I would read it at the end of the day. At first, it felt pointless. But after a few weeks, I started noticing patterns. Turns out, I wasn't just being \"lazy\" - I was avoiding specific types of tasks when I felt overwhelmed or unsure where to start. I am a software dev who also do the product management at my company. And I hate doing \"research\" on features.\n\nThe weird thing is, just being aware of these patterns made them easier to deal with. When I know that if i had to do research, greater changes i won't be productive today. And now Instead of beating myself up, I started break down the scary tasks into smaller chunks using this tool I found. (If anyone wants it, I left it in my bio)\n\nI'm not saying I'm some productivity guru now and I still waste time watching stupid yt videos when I should be working. But holy shit, the difference is night and day. Projects that used to take me forever to start are getting done without the usual last-minute panic.",

They were friends even before me and my ex got to know each other and started dating. And now it has been almost a year since the breakup. I am not in contact with her anymore, have not been for a long time.\n\nMy cousin is doing great. He plays basketball, recently won a medal, got featured on the school’s Instagram page, and he is kinda good looking too. He and my ex still follow each other on Instagram and Snapchat. And every time I see his posts or imagine her seeing them, something inside me just burns a little.\n\nBut I want to make it clear that I do not hate my cousin at all. In fact, I am really proud of him every time I see him doing well. We are like best friends in the whole family, and we get along great. This is not about hate or envy toward him. It is just something inside me that I am trying to understand.\n\nI do not even know what I am jealous of. Is it him being in touch with her? Is it him being good at something? Or just the fact that I am not in that world anymore? I am not angry at him, I just feel replaced maybe.\n\nI am proud that I have at least realized this and I want to deal with it in a healthy way. If anyone has been through something similar, how do you deal with these thoughts? How do you not let jealousy eat you alive?\n",

But there is a common trend with most of these girls.

Just something about girls getting close to me emotionally freaks me out especially if it’s done quickly. \n\nI recently lost a girl-friend who I only knew for about 3 months but we both had a very good connection (agreed on both sides) like no other and I sabotaged it, lost her forever. Sometimes I’m able to get over this sabotage with girls but it takes multiple months and often the girl has to be open to me coming back. This isn’t the case all the time and I understand why. I’m 100% at fault and the way I think is ass backwards. \n\nAre there anyways to improve this? Or does anyone have any ideas why I do it? I want to get back into dating but I’m nervous I’ll do it to a girl I really like. \n\nSome context that may help. I use to be overweight and bullied when I was younger. Never thought I was good enough for a girl. I’m now at a normal weight and I do get attention from girls. I am also in therapy working on this problem upon others.\n\nThanks ",

      "selftext": "Our age has taught us to want more and more. Like every other teenager I had high aspirations, which naturally lead me to this space of self improvement.\n\nHowever, self improvement had me going in circles, at times it was even brutal because it constantly had me questioning what I could change about myself.\n\nIt took me a lot of books, content on youtube and life-lessons to realize it is not about what you can add but about what you can subtract.\n\nThe shiny marketing world and advertisements will have us believe we can always have more. Similarly self improvement will have us believe we can always do better.\n\nWhile the emotion behind that is genuine and true, the harsh truth is that having done most of the popular self-help advice and having achieved a lot of what we as teens generally dream of.\n\nHere are my two cents: It is not about what you can have but about what you can give. If you want to have a great quality of life which self improvement can help you towards, you must be willing to and come with an attitude of what value you can offer rather than what you desire.\n\nSo if you are a teenager and very ambitious, while that is fine, my advice to you would be to know it all comes with great sacrifice and to not fall for the glamour and the shine. Have patience and be ready to pay the cost, because it does cost a lot. Yes, it certainly is worth getting on this journey. Do not mistake it for a quick fix or a get rich quick mindset, that will always have you in a rut. \n",

      "selftext": "Growing up and going through school, I learned that there were correct things and wrong things. There was a correct behavior, a correct answer, a correct schedule, and so on. Correctness is judged through tests. I learned to like taking tests. I liked the excitement of finding out if my thinking was correct and aiming for the top scores. This black and white thinking and obsession with correctness began to bleed into everything, and it served me well in school.\n\nHowever, in life it is not at all that simple. Rarely are there correct or wrong answers, mostly just different choices with complex outcomes (excluding illegal activities). For life choices big or small, it is foolish to think there is one correct answer with all the rest being wrong. Yet this is what school would have you believe.\n\nNow this may seem like an abstract problem, but for me it manifests as decision anxiety. This can show up when deciding what to eat, what to do for the next hour, how I choose my friends, how I choose my relationships or really anything. It leads me to be very critical, because for me it is not about experience or enjoyment, it is about how correct it is.\n\nIt kills the enjoyment and leads me to avoid making any decisions unless I reach a state I call alignment, where I am absolutely certain a particular decision is correct. These alignment states are phenomenal and hit me like an epiphany, but they are very rare. In the meantime, I sit in uncertainty and noncommitment.\n\nIf you are reading this and relate, please realize that life is not a test, and there is no correct life. Life is magnificently complex and amazing. With a good attitude, you can turn a bad decision into a gold rush, or you can turn a perfect decision into a personal hell. It is very hard to determine, so do not worry about it too much.\n\nAt the end of your life, you will not be tallied or graded against your peers. At the end of your life, all you will have is your own judgment of your own life. So live by your own standards. You are your own master.\n\n  \nHas anyone else noticed how hard it is to unlearn the need to be “right” all the time?",

      "selftext": "Almost a year ago I did a parts therapy (Internal Family Systems) session with a hypnotherapist because, mid 40’s, I was desperate to actually start accomplishing goals in life. The therapist said the session would be successful if we got all my parts to agree to work together as a supportive team. \n\nUnfortunately, nothing changed.\n\nRecently, in a moment of objectivity, I thought about the roles of each of my parts, and I realized that I didn’t have a single part that DID any work!! No wonder I wasn’t accomplishing any goals!  \n\nSo, I thought about who/what I would want that part to be, and for now, I’m using Brian Tracy (speaker, author of *Eat that Frog!* and like 100 other books), and it seems to be working. \n\nIt's a bit disappointing that the therapist didn't see this gap or suggest adding another part to my team. Of course this is possible and beneficial! Why not add someone intentionally to help you thrive rather than rely on a team created out of outdated survival and coping mechanisms?!\n\n*Please note I am sharing this in case the idea is helpful for others, I am not interested in any judgmental comments from armchair critics.

That is when your thoughts wander and you start to reflect on life and purpose. The problem is that we never reach that state anymore because the moment we feel even slightly bored, we grab our phones. We scroll, refresh, distract, anything to avoid being alone with our thoughts.\n\nBrooks mentioned that people in a study preferred giving themselves electric shocks instead of sitting quietly for fifteen minutes. That says a lot about how uncomfortable boredom feels. But that discomfort is exactly what helps us think deeply and find meaning. When we constantly avoid it, we lose touch with ourselves.\n\nHe suggests spending more time without screens, like going to the gym or commuting in silence, avoiding phones during meals, and not sleeping next to them. It feels hard at first, but then your mind starts to calm down and you feel more present.\n\nIt is not about quitting technology. It is about remembering who you are when the noise stops.\n",

But, once you get the hang of it nothing will come close to making you feel energetic and productive as much as a healthy and stable sleeping schedule.\n\nStart going to bed and waking up on a routine. I used to stay up late watching self improvement content because that is the only time I would get, but when I stopped doing that and going to sleep earlier, I felt so energetic I would do my tasks that much more efficiently.

I don’t have the will to do anything, I’m falling back on assignments because of it. My life just feels like a loss.\n\nAlso I’ve been single for a while now, I don’t really even miss my ex anymore, she was kinda annoying, but I miss not having to worry about finding someone else. I have this ideal woman in my eyes and she doesn’t seem to exist. I just want someone who gets me that shares the same interests as me that I could start a family with but with my current dating pool and how dating has become as a whole it seems like it’s never going to happen.",

I can't stop thinking about how much I want to work out right now, and how much I want to study. I suppose I should've expected this sonce I've been surrounding myself with these topics in a positive way for days lately, but I don't know what to do at the moment. This has been reoccurring for me and mostly happens at night.. so during the day I don't get as much done and at night O can't sleep. I wouldn't have an issue with this normally but since I'm trying to fix my sleep schedule and go to sleep at 22, this feels like it needs to get under control...\n\nThis could also come from my almost narcissistic need to be WAY ahead of everyone. I'm genuenly willing to push myself so hard that its going to be mere impossible for people to get where I am, I just want them to look at me, see me and idolise me, knowing they most likely won't get to where I am. That may be why I am so focused on this so much.. even if it's only study and sports",

I find it weird though because I grew up in a household where TV before sleep was a daily family activity, so my brain just kind of tied down to that habit.\n\nHas anyone here got rid of their TV even though they like watching it daily, in hopes of being more productive and allow for healthier past time activities?

All while never actually being able to apply them into my life. Not because the will was not there, but often times because it was too much information for myself to grasp and then execute.\n\nI devised a very simple yet effective technique that I have now been using that has done wonders for me, what I like to call the simply stupid technique. Basically, as you come across something that you feel is absolutely relevant to you and you need to apply this. Grab your notes, can be digital but I advice to use pen and paper for best results initially at least.\n\nWrite down in the most basic way you can imagine the actionable step for yourself think of writing it down for dummies. You can use this post to test it, just grab something and then write the simplest actionable step for yourself from this post. Example : Grab my paper and write down the most basic actionable step every time I come across something valuable.",

How can I keep myself from becoming bitter?\n\nI (33 NB) have had severe treatment resistant depression my whole life, along with ADHD and, as I learned this Jan, ASD. \nThe last 5 years have been back to back traumatic events for me, starting off with being a nurse on the first COVID unit and being the first responder to my mother when she had her fatal stroke. The universe has not stopped throwing hands. I won’t list all the traumas for brevity, but I’ve had to be hospitalized 3x in 4 years for SI. \n\nI’m lonely as hell. All my friends are married (or soon to be) and moved away in the span of 2 years. They have their partners to support them and don’t need me emotionally as much as I need them. I’m an intelligent, loving, giving, passionate, interesting person- but I’m so alone. I know that I deserve love and companionship while recognizing I’m not owed it from anyone, and it sucks. \n\nIt’s getting hard to be happy for my friends. Watching people make milestones and major life accomplishments and being happy with their partners, celebrating anniversaries, etc. I’m starting to feel bitter and resentful. I deserve all that too, why can’t I have that? Why can’t I have security and love? Everyone says “it gets better” but it’s been 5 fucking years of the universe throwing hands and I’m exhausted. What am I even fighting for at this point?\n\nI don’t want to become bitter. I don’t want to become angry when I hear sweet, happy stories because I’m resentful and jealous. But I feel the change happening. I’m 33 and it feels like the chance of finding a partner is rapidly declining. \n\nHow do I keep from getting bitter?",

      "selftext": "I ended a toxic relationship about six months ago where I poured my entire lifeblood into him and the relationship. He was highly avoidant and a covert narcissist and basically took and took and took, giving nothing back. I waded on him hand and foot. I lost myself and the rest of my life trying to fix us. He did nothing to help me or us despite me begging, so I ended it, despite not really wanting to.\n\nA couple months after the breakup, I bought a neglected, ruined century home that was severely damaged by cat pee, cigarette smoke, and not being taken care of. I've singled handedly renovated it myself, ripping up floors, cleaning and sealing them, new walls, painting, baseboards, and I'm converting the basement into a rental.\n\nBetween that and my day job it's been an endless onslaught of blood, sweat, and tears. It was fun at first but I'm truly starting to despise it, and this morning I had an epiphany.\n\nI thought I was doing something for myself, something challenging, but I'm realizing I traded one flavour of desperate self-sacrifice for another. I'm lonely as fuck doing all this on my own, isolated, still reeling from the relationship and everything it did to me and took from me, while trying to manage the living nightmare that is this cursed house.\n\nWhat I really needed was to reconnect to myself, to find my people and make real friends, to cultivate inner peace, and to rediscover my hobbies. Instead I poured myself into yet another brutal and relentless \"project\" to fix and it's finally dawning on me that I'm repeating the same patterns. I'm trying to find my self worth through suffering.\n\nI'm honestly at my wits end with this all and I'm not sure what to do. I don't know how to put myself out there, to find people, or what I even enjoy anymore. I'm a shell of who I used to be, useful to only rip off pieces of myself for the sake of something to fix.",

I’ve completely fallen off track and honestly, I’ve been doing nothing productive at all. It feels like I’ve lost my rhythm and motivation somewhere along the way. Also i don't have any friends to ask help for as i'm not that social and usually i talk to my sis but she's dealing with her problems so i'm left on my own.\nJust needed your help guys.\n\nBut today, I’m taking accountability for myself. No more excuses. I want to get back up and rebuild that focus and discipline I once had.\n\nI know many of you have been through similar phases — how did you cope after failure or losing momentum? What helped you bounce back stronger?\n\nI’d really appreciate a little push or advice from you all. Sometimes hearing from strangers who’ve walked the same path hits differently.\n\nThanks for reading 🙏\n",

      "selftext": "When I was in my early twenties, I shared a room with a close friend who I had known since childhood. We were working in Seoul at different companies. This friend set his alarm at 5am every weekday morning,  even though he usually went to bed at 11-12 at night. He was able to get up right away. I set my alarm at 6:30am and struggled to get out of bed. This has been the story of my life. \n\nFor a long time, I didn't ask him about this because I was waiting to see if he would falter; he never changed. Eventually I asked him what his secret was. His answer was that he was excited to get on with his day. He was excited about his work and all the people he was going to meet. A lot of people were attracted to him: women liked him,  guys wanted to hang out with him. Even older employees liked having him around.\n\nThat was years and years ago. I experimented with different methods and finally I believe I have something that works well for me (I can't use a loud speaker going off anymore because I'm married to a Korean woman who can make my life miserable at the drop of a hat).\nIn the morning when I wake up, if I'm lying in bed, I try to mentally raise my energy level. From 0 or low gear, I try to mentally push myself to a high gear, a level of energy sufficiently high enough that it doesn't make sense to just lie in bed anymore. Pretty soon I am no longer sleepy but feel wide awake. This can be something that is done internally, but I suppose physical morning exercises may work as well - I'm speaking only about the mental. In the past if I didn't do this, then when I woke up, my mind would just scan my overall mood to sense how ready I was to get out of bed and face the world.\n\n\nA different friend also indirectly helped me with this; he's been an acquaintance for many years. He started many businesses that all seemed to be decently successful. Early on, my impression of him was that he was cocky. Over the years, he improved the impression he gave off, and I think that way he now interacts with people is \"magical\"- he bonds easily with others. Always seems to be in a playful mood no matter what. I asked him about this. His answer was that if somebody is frustrating him, to combat the feeling of frustration intolerance, he mentally creates or pushes his own inner joy/happiness  level up, and that helps him in some situations and helps him feel patience and is able to maintain a certain lightness in his actions. I think it's the same tool that I use to wake up and get out of bed in the morning",

But something in us wilts.\nAnd the parts we silence don’t stay quiet — they grow in the dark.\nSometimes as anxiety. Sometimes as rage. Numbness. Burnout. Disconnection.\nBut this quote says something radical:\nThat if we dare to bring out what’s inside us —\neven the messy parts, the wounded parts, the wild parts —\nthen that’s where healing lives.\nThat’s where freedom begins.\nNot necessarily salvation in the religious sense,\nbut in the deeply human one:\nThe chance to be whole. The chance to come home to ourselves.\nI don’t know how to do it fully yet.\nBut I know this:\nI keep trying everyday because I don’t want to die with unlived important truth inside me.\nI don’t want to be destroyed by my own silence.\nI want to bring it forth — piece by piece.\nIs anyone else feeling this?\nAnyone else sitting with something inside that’s begging to be seen, spoken, honored?\nHow do you do it?\nHow do you find the courage?\n\n\n",

      "selftext": "The life of a normal man is a life of almost no control and powerlessness and self improvement doesn’t do much. So how can these human beings stay active and go to work, socialise, workout, improve their minds, maintain their health etc if their lives is almost entirely stuck in a loop of same days and not being appreciated and insulted etc? How can a normal man not lose his mind knowing that he has decades of suffering with minimal pay off while people benefit off him and there is little he can do plus he risks his career and livelihood if he doesn’t hold back? How long can a normal man take this while being exhausted alone after work in their apartments and their jadedness increases overtime which could remove being refreshed from entertainment? How can a normal man not lose self esteem when he is treated like invisible trash and is not seen as desirable or as non disposable even for conversing with and the man has to put extra effort to even get socialising in, even more so with age and is still not appreciated? How can a normal man not want to bed rot when after sacrificing several decades to get to the finish line of a hard degree and substantial gym progress and social skills etc means mostly nothing and doesn’t change their course of life much and the reward is more suffering to have a lack lustre life with not much change till death with hope that they can at;east entertain themselves still by then and beat major issues like not getting basic needs met easily therefore constantly experiencing feelings of loneliness, dry spells, no love even after putting a lot of effort and dealing with major negative aspects to just get a few chances at that but with little guarantee like some circus clown and are expected to appreciate the fact that they were even given a chance and then feel like they are some worthless slave asking for food in a prison camp and are disposable? Why should a man continue living and how is it fair that they don’t have a choice to stop their suffering? \n\nI couldn’t think of more in the moment but I think this is quite a bit. Would really appreciate some detailed discussions on the topic and points since it should benefit people a lot and also I would love to learn myself. Hope everyone has a great week!",

      "selftext": "Hello, I wonder if anyone else has had this struggle: There are just too many things for me to self-improve in. And new ones keep mercilessly piling up.\n\nI have a serious knowledge gap in basically any practical life skill, plus my job requires constant self-education in multiple fields. My lifestyle also isn't the best, so there's work to be done too. So I indeed have very much to learn or improve. And due to its sheer volume, I feel like I can never manage it in my lifetime. Everything looks like it takes at least several years to get the necessary basics or first results, and even if I dedicated just \\~20 minutes of self-improvement per day to each area, it would still mean 20 minutes daily for 316 things. Even if I narrowed it down to the *very most* pressing and important areas, I'd still be left with at least 40 ones.\n\nAnd what's worse, almost every day I find a new area that I realise I know nothing (or very little) about and that seems painfully essential for my future life. So they keep piling up, and the more they do, the more frustrating and overwhelming it feels.\n\nBy now, I feel like I would need at least 1,000 years to settle this self-improvement debt.\n\nDo you have any advice that could be useful in a case like this? Is there even a way to get out of this situation?\n\nThank you very much for any answer 🙏",

      "title": "I regret quitting my apprenticeship and it eats me alive every day",
      "selftext": "I’m 23M and the biggest regret of my life (so far) is quitting my apprenticeship when I was 19.\n\nBack in 2021 I had just finished a college course and landed an apprenticeship. I already had a couple somewhat related to the role qualifications and a full UK driving license, so I thought I was heading in the right direction. During college, I was also working a part-time job at a supermarket. I quit that job to take the apprenticeship, but at the time I felt the £4 an hour wage was completely unfair. I kept thinking, ''why am I accepting so little when even stacking shelfs at a supermarket payed me over double?'' That frustration convinced me to quit 2 months in.\n\nLooking back, that was the worst decision I ever made. The apprenticeship wasn’t perfect, and it wasn’t run amazingly well but it was a stable path with a future. If I had just stuck it out, I’d have 4 years of experience behind me right now, maybe even an actaul career i enjoyed. Instead, I’ve spent my early 20s bouncing between dead-end jobs, feeling stuck and regretting everything.\n\nI know this may sound overly dramatic, i really do, but I’ve never felt regret on this level before. It’s the kind of regret that completely takes over your mind.\n\nEvery single day I wake up and think, *''*what if i stayed?'*'* I can’t escape that thought. I could have had a mortage by now, a nicer car, career etc. I feel like I sabotaged my own life because I was young, impatient, and arrogant. At 19, I thought I was standing up for myself by refusing to accept £4 an hour. Now, at 23, I’d give anything to go back and stick with it.\n\nThese days I spend hours on job sites applying for anything I can, apprenticeships, trainee roles, entry-level jobs. I even paid couple hundred pounds for a CSCS card. I send out emails practically begging for a chance, but most of the time I don’t hear back as the job market is an absolute mess. Meanwhile, everyone around me is moving forward with careers or finishing university and I’m here spinning my wheels the last 4 years.\n\nIt eats me alive knowing that if I just accepted that wage and hadn’t walked away, I’d already be so much further in life. I feel like a failure and I can’t stop blaming my younger self for throwing away what could have been my future. All i had to do is show up.",

      "title": "What Happens If You Run Every Day for 30 Days?",
      "selftext": "That’s the question I asked myself exactly thirty days ago. Then I went out for a run every day — and now I have the answer.\n\nIt all started at the end of November 2023. I used to take my daughter to her classes and had some time to kill in the area. I love walking, but after a few weeks of wandering around, I’d already explored every street and alley within an hour’s walk.\n\nSo one day I thought: *“What if I start running?”*\n\nI have to say — I used to hate running. But at that moment, it seemed like a decent idea.\n\nThen came Murakami’s book *“What I Talk About When I Talk About Running.”*\n\nAnd then came 224 runs, including today’s.\n\nI wasn’t too systematic — not exactly regular — and my distances varied from 2 to 21.5 km.\n\nSo far I’ve logged:\n\n* 66 runs of 5 km,\n* 21 runs of 10 km,\n* several runs of 13, 15, 16, and 18 km,\n* and three half-marathons.\n\nSo I thought I was tough enough for daily running.\n\nOn September 8 — the day after my last **half-marathon** — I went out for another run. And I managed a record-breaking 2.52 km 🙈 It felt tough, but I decided it was better than nothing.\n\nAfter that came 28 more runs, averaging about 4 km each.\n\nAnd finally, here’s what it all led to:\n\n1. **A solid habit.** Definitely. Rain (and we’ve had a *lot* of rain lately), wind (we even had a storm warning recently), sore leg, headache, stomach ache, plans for a movie, theatre, or parent meeting — none of these are excuses anymore.\n2. **Sleep improved dramatically.** I’ve always struggled with sleep. Before the war, I even took medication for two years to fall asleep. My mind is always racing with thoughts that keep me awake. But running changed everything. Now I fall asleep — and wake up — like a normal person.\n3. **Weight — unchanged.**\n4. **Cardio endurance — unchanged.** It’s always been high, but due to the monotony of my runs, it even dipped slightly. Starting on day 21, I added interval training — alternating between fast and slow running — and things began to improve again. I’m still observing.\n5. **Mental health — doing great.** I’ve stopped replaying negative scenarios in my head so much.\n6. **Side effect — more time for podcasts, interviews, and audiobooks.**\n7. **Overall — I’ve become even more disciplined.**\n8. **Most crucial insight — another exercise in critical thinking.** Let me explain. It might seem that if you run every day for a whole month, some magic should happen — I don’t know, weight loss, a body transformation, a significant speed boost. But in reality, 30 days is excellent — not magical. Systems work when they’re consistent and long-term. So let’s not fall for quick fixes or instant results. Just like in life — if you want real results, do the work.\n\nWhat’s next? I don’t know. For now, I plan to keep running every day — and see how it goes.\n\nOverall, I’m really proud of myself. I even came here to brag a little :)",

      "selftext": "I’ve had stammering since childhood. Honestly, it was really tough  my family never cared enough to send me to a speech therapist, and that made things worse for me.\n\nBy the time I turned 23, I was struggling with:\nSevere anxiety while speaking\nBlockages and breath going up when talking to people\nFumbling and rushing words\nConstant fear of speaking in groups\n\nBut around 3–4 months ago, I decided to take control and started practicing regularly. Slowly, I’ve been improving a lot, and I can honestly say I feel much better now. I believe with consistent practice, in the next 3 months I can overcome stammering by at least 70%, and then keep working on it step by step.\n\nIf anyone here is struggling with stammering, I want to share the practices that helped me. I researched a lot on YouTube, websites, and experimented daily until I found what works\n\nMy Stammering Practice Routine\n\n1. Basic Sounds Practice\n\nPractice alphabets: A, B, C, D… and vowles A,E,I,O,U\nKannada letters: ಅ, ಆ…(my mother tongue)\nSyllables: ka, kaa, ki, kii…\n\n2. Tongue & Speech Exercises\n\nHold a pen between your teeth and try speaking.\nPractice tongue twisters slowly and clearly.\nDo tongue stretching exercises (pull tongue out and try speaking).\nPractice dragging/elongating sounds while speaking.\n\n3. Reading & Speaking Practice\n\nSlowly read an English paragraph for 15–20 minutes daily.\nFocus on clear pronunciation and using every mouth/tongue muscle (like an exercise).\nDo mirror practice (watch yourself while speaking).\nDo recording practice (record your voice and listen back).\n\n4. Voice & Listening Exercises\n\nDo humming sounds (mmm, nnn) to relax and improve flow.\nWatch Jennifer Forester’s YouTube channel – she has “listen and repeat” exercises that are really helpful.\nPractice speaking slowly and dragging words until it feels natural\n\n5. Breathing Exercise\n\nPractice diaphragmatic breathing (belly breathing).\nInhale deeply through the nose.\nExpand your stomach, not chest.\nExhale slowly and controlled.\nTry speaking short sentences in one breath to improve breath control\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nI know how painful stammering feels  the anxiety, the blockages, the embarrassment. But trust me, with consistent practice, you can improve a lot.\n\nI’ve only been practicing for about 3–4 months, and I can already feel the difference. If I can do this without a therapist, just with self-practice, you can too.\n\nDon’t give up. Work on it daily, and you’ll overcome it step by step\n",

      "selftext": "I used to rely on motivation, emotions and sometimes even my feelings to do my habits. But this idea of making my goals stupidly simple completely changed the way I did tasks and helped me build momentum for 60+ days now.\n\nI have already made posts talking about this, but I cannot simply stress enough the importance of this mindset and how much it has helped me stay on track. So, I started a simple exercise before months where I would do bare bones and a minimal habit of things I had been delaying for years.\n\nMonths after, I am still very much active and have more or less successfully being doing the habits I started everyday. Yes, it is no magic potion, as in there are days where I have to make an active effort and push myself. But it has more or less become automated for me to write a new post everyday and to record a video of myself and post it everyday. What’s more? I helped about 10k and more people with my posts and my content, which I am absolutely stoked about.\n\nThe actionable advice is very easy, just make a very stupidly simple goal, something that makes you laugh, if you want to start going to the gym, just make it a routine to dress up for your gym everyday. If even that seems crazy, just look at your gym clothes, or subconsciously think about what you will wear to the gym. I know I might sound ridiculous but this stuff works and I absolutely can vouch for it. Go and make your stupidly simple goal right now.",

The happiest people have a “high tolerance for irritation and a low requirement for joy.” The more annoyances you can tolerate without letting it affect your mood and the lower your bar is for experiences that bring you joy, the easier it is for you to consider your day as a whole pleasant. \n\nYesterday, I dropped a full cup of coffee on my floor, breaking my late husband’s favorite mug. I repeated “high tolerance for irritation” in my mind while I cleaned it up, poured myself another cup and walked it out to the front porch of my home to sit down in the 75° air to enjoy it. I reminded myself that it’s just a mug and, if he were here, he wouldn’t care that it was broken.\n\nI’d love to know what some of your mantras, reminders or phrases help you move through your life with a little more ease.

      "title": "Running Every Single Day",
      "selftext": "Over fifty days ago I set myself a challenge of running at least 5km every day, without an end date. I planned to make it to at least 100 days but I've not told myself I can stop when I get there. This is reflective of where I'm at, not just on my running journey, but also philosophically: a goal does not move beyond each day. Without looking ahead to a self-assigned end date, I am entirely focussed on the means; there is no end. This feels odd to say when people ask how long I'll do this for, like there ought to always be a finish line. I usually resign myself to replying, \"100 days\", out of goodwill, to save them from a barrage of philosophical ramblings (that's what these essays are for).\n\nA commitment to myself to run every day, no matter the weather, my mood, my well-being, sets a precedent to my inner monkey brain. It reminds it who's in control, that no matter what, I'll do it anyway. Over a single isolated day this act doesn't change much. However, after 50 consecutive times it's impossible to ignore the results of compounding efforts. My brain initially resisted, those first few mornings felt like running with an anvil strapped to my ankle. Then, I'm not sure exactly when, but my brain ceased to talk back. This is when the habit began to take shape, at which point it became harder to not do the difficult thing than to do it. It wasn't only while running that the inner voice of resistance became quieter, it carried over into anything difficult I undertook. Something about noticing the voice speak up but shutting it down by taking action bleeds through into everything—it's not that the voice never surfaces, it's the knowing that it ultimately can't overpower your decision to act, so you do it anyway. The \"I'll do it anyway\" action is the best antidote to an overthinking anxious mind.\n\nIsn't the body and mind's ability to adapt wonderful. Whatever you throw at them, they eventually regulate (and faster than expected), becoming the new baseline. I've felt this acutely over the last couple of weeks, like the challenge is no longer a challenge, just something that I do now, as habitual as brushing my teeth.\n\nThe early days (1-20) were fuelled by rushes of dopamine rewarding me for achieving a newly set goal. This eventually ceded to the more gentle but steady flow of endorphins. The dopamine driver in my head still speaks up, urging me to do more, \"5k is easy now, at least bump it to 7.5k—actually, fuck it, might as well take it to 10k\". But if I accede to that voice I'll be running daily marathons before long. The point isn't to incessantly chase more, just for more's sake, but to sharpen discipline. This is at opposite ends to dopamine driven motivation—for that well is exhaustible, depend on it and I'll likely run dry long before I get where I want to be.\n\nI didn't want to make any sacrifices in the gym, so my recovery in those early day was dreadful; squats and deadlifts after a morning run is something I thought I'd never get used to. The pain and fatigue motivated me to learn more about recovery, to find the right nutrition and supplements for growth both on the road and under the bar. Sleep has never been more important, if I dip below 7 hours of it my body becomes riddled with anxiety, reminding me of the hangovers that haunted my early 20s.\n\nWhen I remain sedentary for too long, my heartbeat slows, which in turn staggers the flow of blood throughout my body. My conscious brain follows suit, thoughts become viscous, cerebral grooves form ridged valleys, trapping thought processes within them. Trying to think through this state of mind feels foggy at best and ruminative at worst. So, instead of pushing through the fog I tie my shoes and take to the street. My heart speeds up, the blood breaks through, flattening the cerebral grooves. Thoughts are set free from their cages. All that was weighing me down dissipates as my feet thud rhythmically against the concrete pavement. I get home, refuel my body, rest and reap the cognitive benefits of a clear, focussed brain for a few hours until the cerebral valleys begin to reform, lightness gives way to heaviness once more. This is the daily cycle of exertion, recovery, growth & decay.\n\nRumination is symptomatic of a brain stuck in a past that it no longer inhabits. Conversely, anxiety is symptomatic of a brain stuck in a future that may never arrive. It goes without saying, neither state offers any value or joy. The only moment worth focussing on is in the present—it's trite because it's true. I used to struggle with this concept, if I wanted to enjoy the present moment to the max then ought I not drown myself in all manner of vices? Clearly, I misunderstood the meaning. It's not about extracting the most pleasure from a moment, but about living in presence and alignment with my values. More simply put, what does the ideal version of me do in the present moment? He rarely, if ever, indulges in pleasure for its own sake—those moments are precious but fleeting, they're byproducts of a life well-lived, not the entire raison d'être.\n\nWhat does any of this have to do with running anyway? Well, presence is most easily attained, for me, while running. I once had a daily meditation ritual that, while somewhat effective, was often a battle of sheer will to reach a meditative state. Conversely, while running I find it hard to remain focussed on anything but the run, meditation is the default state. While marathon training last year I played audiobooks & podcasts to pass the hours on longer runs, but it was always a challenge to remain focussed on them, like my consciousness was desperate to roam freely. Eventually, I stopped putting up that fight, I just put music on and allowed my mind to wander. I couldn't tell you what I thought about on today's run, but I can tell you that none of it stuck to mind. The part of my brain poisoned by productivity gurus would have me believe that this is wasteful, that I'm not capitalising on those hours spent mentally idle. But those seemingly idle hours spent processing my own stream of consciousness does so much more for mind development than tuning into anyone else's.\n\nYou know how your subconscious employs dreams to process the trials of the previous day? How this allows you to wake up with a greater sense of clarity and peace? Especially after those restless nights rolling back and forth, hounded by one intruding thought after another. If you miss those critical hours of REM sleep in which this restorative process takes place, you'll wake up with a brain full of fog. I sense a similar healing system at work while I jog, the forced regularity of my intakes and outtakes of breath, the gentle rhythmic ripples across my body as my trainers hit the ground, this all fosters the perfect environment for the subconscious to create deeper connections, joining one seemingly unrelated thought to another, allowing for the serendipity of thought that often precedes the breakthrough eureka moments of creativity.\n\nMany of history's greatest thinkers took to regular walking breaks from their research. This often unexpectedly led to critical breakthroughs surfacing, typically while not even consciously thinking of the topic under research. This is no coincidence, the adaptive unconscious is always firing, but much more so when the mind is given the time to rest. Experientially I know this to be true, walking or running \"to clear the head\", does just that, it seemingly creates the perfect environment for the brain to clear any debris and build new connections.\n\nFrom about day 40 I noticed that the daily recovery time had accelerated massively. If I run in the morning, by mid-afternoon my footsteps feel light again, as if the run never happened. Each milestone hit throughout the challenge has provided a new boon, both physically and mentally. Before I started the challenge I typically didn't enjoy the run itself, it was more of a sacrifice laid at the feet of my future self. This typically paid off with an endorphin high post run. Somewhere around day 30 this shifted, the run itself became the high, some days it was outright euphoric, often making the morning my favourite part of the day (I used to despise mornings). Looking back, I see the subtle shifts my body and brain made to accommodate the new demands made of them, all of them rewarding in their own unexpected way. On day one all I knew was that it'd get easier, but I couldn't have predicted all the ways in which the easiness eventually manifested.\n\nIt's a surprise to nobody that improving your daily habits will eventually trickle down to a better quality of life. It was, however, a surprise to me just how much a simple 30 minute commitment would shift my perception of the world around me. A welcome reminder that the world is what you make of it. If you don't like the way it's currently made, build it differently. Not literally, exerting influence on the world around you directly isn't always possible but altering the lens in which you view it absolutely is.\n\nA daily run won’t solve all your problems. But it will give you proof, every single day, that you can do hard things no matter how you feel. That proof changes how you see yourself—and once that shifts, everything else follows.",

      "selftext": "Hi all, I 25F recently moved back in with parents for financial reasons after living in another state for a couple of years for my job. Went through a lot of mental health/behavioral issues during high school and college and struggled socially. Upon moving to this new state, I didn’t socialize as much apart from talking to coworkers. Focused basically on working on my job and going to random happy hours in that town and didn’t socialize that much. Worked through a lot of my mental health issues and am now more interested in socializing. There’s absolutely nothing to do in my parent’s town, I feel so isolated, I’m wanting to move back to that town once I have enough money saved up. I do have connections in that town I could reach out to build deeper friendships so I’m not completely isolated. Also want to get more involved at my job, committees and ERGs to meet people. Were any other women here able to rebuild and built community from scratch in their mid 20s? Any success stories?",

I’ve always struggled with procrastination, but I really got my life together in my late 20s — I have a good job now, own my home, and overall things are going well. I’ve kicked a lot of bad habits like gaming addictions and other distractions.\n\nThe one issue I just can’t shake, though, is procrastination at night — almost like an addiction. From what I’ve read, it sounds like *revenge bedtime procrastination*, but nothing I’ve tried helps. I can’t seem to rewire my brain to stop viewing nighttime as my personal leisure time.\n\nIt’s been this way since childhood. I used to sleep on my brother’s floor, talk to him until he fell asleep, and then stay up drawing, reading, or playing Game Boy. I think part of it was that I didn’t want to be alone at night — my parents probably just thought I liked sleeping in the same room for fun.\n\nNow that I live alone, it’s only gotten worse. My weeks usually go like this:\n\n* **Monday:** Pull an all-nighter, push through work exhausted.\n* **Tuesday:** Correct my schedule a bit.\n* **Midweek:** Some nights I stay up too late, others I manage a normal bedtime.\n* **Friday/Saturday:** Stay up extremely late, then crash and sleep in until 2–3 PM.\n* **Sunday:** Sleep as much as possible to “reset” for Monday.\n\nIt’s a cycle I’ve been trapped in for years and can’t seem to break, no matter what I try.\n\nHow can I improve this?",

I don't really talk with friends or really anyone besides immediate family anymore and don't really go outside unless absolutely necessary anymore as well. Socializing has been more and more online \\[playing a ton of video games\\] and I think that contributed to a kind of grammatical collapse or/and a kind of new struggle in articulating what to say. Social anxiety has increased more as well? Actually social anxiety was kind of already there for a couple of years but now I've noticed it to a degree that I want to actually rid myself of it. An example of this social anxiety would be just doing things just to be seen doing things, or being very performative to be direct. \n\nMindset wise my mind is currently all over the place and really have no idea where to start. But if I were to really pick a specific direction I guess I would like to stop being a pussy and get defensive (did many things I now regret, because I put myself into that state of mind) when I perceive somebody is potentially saying/thinking (bruh) some negative things about me, even banter between friends - which is probably social anxiety doing its work there.\n\nI've been avoiding fixing these things for the most part and probably derealized myself to \"autopilot\" myself out of situations outside of my comfort zone for too long and hopefully with some advice I could shift myself into a better track.\n\nThank you in advance guys.",

Every time I tried to stop, the thirst for the pleasure kept coming back. I've been masturbating almost nonstop everyday now for almost a decade now. It's not a streak I'm proud of. I don't know just how to stop. I've used to ridicule people who can't control or stop smoking or masturbating, I've always thought I was in control and this was healthy.

      "selftext": "So, as far back in my childhood as i can remember, the first thought to plague my mind was this intense fear that my parents and ppl I care about are all gonna die and I don't have enough time left. And I can't do anything about it. I still remember lying awake in my dark room, when my parents thought I'm asleep, crying for hours till I fall asleep. This went on for months and then one day i discovered, seeing other innocent ppl suffering was kind of comforting, it made me feel good. Now ofcourse hurting someone irl is bad, so I'd just 'imagine' all these really bad stuffs( and i mean really bad) happening to innocent ppl and that would comfort me. But after a couple of years, i realised how wrong this was, but couldn't do anything about it. Whenever I'd come across suffering of innocent ppl, it'd give me this stimulating and good feeling. This started a vicious cycle of intense self-hatred. I decided I'll only ever do good stuffs for everyone around me and this world but it felt like I was just trying to take revenge on my true self, which is just a sadistic moron. \nEventually I went to high school and when I was 11 yo, my teacher took me to a room, and did stuffs. In the following years, a few of my classmates started doing stuffs with me, then later on another teacher will also indulge himself. Everyone thought he was this angel, so parents really loved him. He'd tell my parents that he'd come to our house and then later on would tell me that we'll sleep in the same bed, he'd do stuffs and no one will even know. Honestly I was really scared. Around class 8, i started feeling depressed, it used to feel like a hole has opened up in my chest. I used to either sleep or laugh and play with my friends, i couldn't handle being with myself. The self hatred became so strong sometimes I'd just let those ppl do whatever they want with me because I knew nothing could hurt me more than those stuffs. I'd feel like throwing myself in the dustbin and disappear. At times I'd run on concrete road, barefoot for hours so that, that pain can make me feel a bit numb. \nI used to be a bright student but studying started to feel quite difficult. After class 12 Covid hit, and i got completely isolated from all my friends, to numb myself I'd just scroll through phone. I wouldn't even enjoy it, but I just couldn't drag myself to do anything meaningful. At times I'd be so frustrated and done with myself that I'd just stab myself with pen and draw blood, 10 20 times at once, I'd count. I couldn't use anything else as i couldn't leave any visible scars and pens r good as they r blunt, so it takes some force to drive them inside skin. I started preping for neet. But all year long I'd just stay numb, scrolling through phone, frustrated and living like a corpse and then before exam I'd start getting intense anxiety attacks for weeks, every single day. I couldn't crack neet first two times. On the third time, I was sure to off myself after the exam, the last week b4 exam I spent deciding where and how. But God's cruel joke on me, somehow cracked the exam, and got good score. It made me feel even worse cuz I cracked it without studying and many of my friends who actually put effort couldn't crack.\nAfter coming to clg, i thought if i socialise things will get better. Everyone there knows me as a really friendly guy, smiling and going around with almost everyone. But honestly, everything, even just looking outside or walking around, feels tasteless like a dish without salt. No matter how much I smile, i play, i go out with them, everything feels hollow, meaningless, like an act. I feel like I'm just covering the sadistic self that i actually am. And I can't get attached with anyone cuz then I get panic attacks about how they r going to die and I can't do anything. Every single day I feel like I'm dragging my dead body to do daily stuffs. I don't even hav the energy to wake up, eat, take shower and only reason I keep doing them cuz my friends and family keep nagging me. I can't study shit, and spend all the time scrolling through phone just to make the time go by. Somedays I dream of those guys from high school, but I see that I'm asking them to do stuffs to me and I'm enjoying it, when I wake up I feel like clawing out my skin and flesh, for days. I feel so done with myself, even stabbing myself with pens doesn't do anything....I feel like a parasite just sucking from my parents and everyone around. I feel like ending everything and only reason I don't do it is cuz my parents don't hav another child, and when I tried to talk about it with my friends in a roundabout way they seemed pretty hurt.\nNow, it's time for final exams, and I don't see any way of passing it. I could've done something but just like always the yearlong numbness followed with intense anxiety attacks every single day for the last two months, I'm just so done with myself. It's just so embarrassing and frustrating cuz very few ppl get year back in 1st yr of medical clg. But I've finally come to a point where I've realised how my issue is affecting those around me and more importantly how changing my mindset or motivation isn't going to fix anything. I've decided I'm going to ask for professional help and counseling after the exams are over. \n\nBut before that, I just want to know, is life like this for everyone on average, am i a bit messed up or am i just being a whiny bitch, trying to avoid accountability for my academic mess up? It just feels so unfair cuz I don't need money, fame nothing....I just want to study and build something nice for this world and live a life where I can feel happiness, but I can't even focus on my studies for a day and everyone probably thinks I'm a lazy piece of shit.",

      "selftext": "Honestly in the last few years I’ve really improved my life especially compared to where I was. I remember I didn’t even like going out, I would get serious social anxiety and felt like every little thing mattered. If I had to do something like see a relative, go to the store, even getting my license I would ruminate about it all day long and it felt like the end of the world. Well I got my license, started helping with taking my sister places, I would then get nervous about little things like pumping gas or driving on the freeway and now both of those things are easy as fuck and I wonder how or why I was so scared of it. I then took some mushrooms and realized how I didn’t like myself and the place I was in, I had hit like 200lbs, I had a neck beard, and a trashy haircut, I wasn’t working or even making an attempt to get a job. After about 6 months to a year I lost 50lbs got down to 150lbs,I took an entrance exam for an apprenticeship program and failed, I got a job at starter bros and quit after 1 day. I still kept going, I studied for the exam and I passed this time. I’ve now been working as in the field for about a month. I’ve done a lot of meetings, met a lot of people, done a lot of things on my own, worked the 8 hours days, got up early at 4-5am every weekday and quitting doesn’t even cross my mind, I’m going all in. It’s crazy to look back at all those things I worried about or thought I couldn’t do because now I can do it with no hesitation. If someone wants to hang out I’ll show up, if I have to run errands I’ll do it no problem, if I have to drive far on the freeway that’s fine, if I have to do some work meetings or whatever I’ll do it despite being nervous. So looking back I really have come a long way, I went from isolated pot head kid with no drive to a young man who is doing the things I need to do despite the uncertainty.  \n\nIt really shows that growth happens over a long period of time, unnoticed, until you look back and see the changes and realize you’re a different person who can handle more things.  \n\nAnd I’m not trying to write this to brag, I just don’t really ever acknowledge my growth, I actually usually think more negatively about myself most days but idk I need to write this down and say it out loud cause I should be proud even if this growth isn’t big to some it’s huge steps for me.

Even like 10 years ago I remember feeling out of place among groups. In middle school I went in from homeschooling, and I was super friendly to everyone and never questioned if someone wanted me around or not. \n\nI befriended people that I shouldn’t have, and they would cut me down any chance they got to make themselves feel better and I became a punching bag. I never defended myself, I would just go along like I was their jester so that they would like me without worrying if they cared about me. By the end of that year I kept to myself, only time I would strike up a conversation with someone I didn’t know well was if they initiated.\n\nCome high school I was still a mess. I started being friends with girls more but very surface level. I figured they all thought I was just talking to them in hopes of dating because that’s how most guys were. I still rarely ever talk to girls I graduated with because we barely spoke. It slowly got better but not much.\n\nSome girls had crushes on me but I never really noticed them because I brushed the idea of someone wanting me off. I wasn’t even anyone’s best friend, how was someone going to wanna DATE me? It wasn’t possible in my eyes. But eventually one girl was interested, and I was completely unprepared and it went to shit. The feeling from before was 10 times worse. I thought all my friends spoke to me out of pity and that if I was gone that they would feel relief.\n\nAfter a whole year of feeling that way, one of the few girls I was actually friends with and I started dating. It was good until the thrill wore off, we had little in common, she was a mess from her childhood and I can’t tell myself I’m good enough, and she was very high strung and I lack any sense of urgency, also her music taste was abysmal dogshit, so she wound up leaving me, and now I feel back where I started.\n\nI thought college would be a big help with finding someone but finding a good match is hard, I can’t think of anyone I even want to date right now, and when I do see a girl I’m into, I tell myself I’m not good enough and don’t really do anything about it. Every man I know that has a girlfriend isn’t me, so why would some girl make the exception and date me? I’m not tall, I don’t have facial hair, my biggest passions are cooking and nature which most people my age don’t care for much. I just feel like I’n defective and any time I try to talk myself up and tell myself that I AM good enough it feels blasphemous, it feels like I’m breaking the rules.\n\nI’m so lost, I need to start believing in myself but I feel so far gone. This mindset has been 10 years in the making, it feels like a part of who I am.",

The problems come from wanting to be there — to reach a place where everything makes sense. This has different names all over literature: flow state, enlightenment, or transcendence. \n\nI’m starting to think that instead of focusing on the destination, I should focus on the journey. I like to think of it as a journey to nowhere.

      "title": "Why Do I Yawn During Learning Sessions Despite Getting Enough Sleep?",
      "selftext": "\nI’ve been reflecting on a peculiar pattern I’ve noticed throughout my life, particularly in learning and training environments. Whenever I find myself in a situation where someone is teaching me or discussing a topic that doesn’t genuinely capture my interest, I begin to yawn frequently. This isn’t merely a sign of fatigue; it’s a physical response I’ve experienced since childhood.\n\nThis yawning phenomenon often arises during training sessions or workshops, where I feel pressured to focus and not bring out my phone but lack the ability to engage fully. Interestingly, when I participate in activities that I find stimulating or enjoyable, I don’t experience this issue at all. I initially thought my excessive yawning might be linked to my diagnosed sleep apnea, but since starting to use my CPAP machine, which has improved my sleep quality, the yawning persists. But only doing these kind of times.\n\nIn the past few years, I’ve noticed that in training scenarios where I can’t access my phone for distractions, maintaining my attention becomes increasingly difficult. In contrast, when I had the freedom to use my phone during classes or lectures, I found it easier to stay awake and with no yawning, even if only partially I'm able to keep my attention. It seems that without those distractions, the lack of stimulating engagement leads me to yawn and feel drowsy, making it challenging to stay focused.\n\nI’ve also realized that I struggle with traditional note-taking, which only adds to my frustration. I dislike the process so much that it often feels like a chore, and I worry it detracts from my ability to absorb information. I’m exploring alternatives, like using AI tools to help summarize key points or facilitate my learning in a more engaging way.\n\nIs this normal? Why could this be happening? ’m\n\nI wanna find strategies to help myself in these situations. How can I enhance my focus and retention when I’m not genuinely interested in the topic? If anyone has experienced something similar or has insights into techniques that could assist me, such as alternative methods of note-taking or ways to stay engaged, I would love to hear your thoughts. Also is this even normal?\n",

      "selftext": "A few years ago, I was involved in what most would call an “accident.” But now I’m starting to wonder… was it really?\n\nMaybe it was the universe — or something greater — redirecting me toward what I was meant to become. Preparing me. Forging me. This is a reflection I wrote about how that moment didn’t break me, but awakened me:\n\n⸻\n\nWhatever that was meant for me will show up at the exact right time. Not late, not early, but at the exact right time.\n\nI was involved in an accident, but was it actually an accident? Or was it the universe and spiritual reality just preparing me for what is next to come in my life? Was it getting me ready for my real purpose?\n\nThings happen for a reason. I fell, but maybe I was meant to fall. After that fall I raised up wiser, stronger, and with more confidence in myself than before.\n\nWas that “accident” supposed to happen to show me how powerful, and strong of a person I am deep down inside?\n\nI didn’t dwell on that misfortunate situation. I just put all my energy into what I should do next, now. I wasn’t ever in a stagnant position — I grew and grew — and then realized that I can have a positive impact on people’s lives, more now than before.\n\nI can, and I will help others grow.\n\nIt might be helping them physically grow, or emotionally grow, or mentally grow. I do what I can, but I’m not always trying — sometimes it just happens.\n\nI try to motivate and inspire others to take their life in their own hands and grow into it. It might be from words I say or from my daily actions.\n\nAnd I might not always know that I’m “helping” a person… they could just be watching me in silence, taking notes of what I might be doing, or even how I’m doing something.\n\nAt the end of it all, I just want to help those who need to shift from surviving to thriving.\n\nAnd that one thing that can change it all doesn’t have to be a huge, spectacular event.\n\nIt could just be a simple string of words…\n\nOr even just a small action I do without knowing someone is watching me.\n\nI try to understand how I went from survival mode to consistent thriving mode.\n\n\n----\nI used to think I was broken. Turns out, I was just being rebuilt. If you’re stuck in survival mode, I promise: it’s not the end. Your real story might just be starting.\n",

MIND + GROUNDING (minimum 20 minutes)\n\t•\tEvery day, complete at least 20 minutes of conscious grounding or inner balance practice.\n\t•\tYou may combine it with learning or education, but never passive media.\n\n⸻\n\n🔸 5. LEARNING / STUDENT GOAL\n\t•\tDedicate minimum 45 minutes daily to active learning.\n\t•\tStudy, read academic materials, develop a skill, or do creative learning work.\n\n⸻\n\n🔸 6. GROWTH TRACKERS\n\t•\t📖 Read 10 pages of nonfiction or self-improvement daily.\n\t•\t📸 Take a daily photo or short written reflection.\n\n⸻\n\n🔹 MENSTRUAL ADAPTATION RULE\n\nNo skipping.\nYou may lower workout intensity or adjust focus, but all minimums (2×45 + 20 grounding + 45 learning) stay intact.",

Walking, shopping, traveling on the bus… I’d always have my phone out, lost in reels.\n\nI never realized how much it was affecting me — the anxiety, the constant comparison, and the overload of useless information I was feeding my mind every day.\n\nA few days ago, I finally decided to delete both apps. I made a rule for myself: I can only check DMs from my desktop.\n\nAnd today, for the first time, I went outside without earphones and without scrolling — and honestly, it felt amazing.\n\nI smiled at random pedestrians, and they smiled back. Some even greeted me.\n\nI noticed the beautiful buildings near my home — the same ones I pass every day, but today they looked different… almost alive.\n\nI actually asked the Walmart staff for help and their recommendations instead of avoiding interaction.\n\nI held doors for people and thanked those who held them for me — simple things, but this time I was present while doing them.\n\nIt’s hard to describe, but I feel genuinely happy and much less anxious. Deleting social media might be one of the best decisions I’ve ever made.",

      "selftext": "I've been dealing with depression, amongst other things, for years. But over the past couple of years I began to notice just how lonely I am. I have no friends, no relationship, and it's just all so difficult. When I was younger, I tried making online friends for about 2 or maybe 3 years, and it was horrible. I was on so many apps, even Reddit. It really hurts when you want something so badly and you put so much energy and effort into someone and you think things are going well and that you've finally made a friend only to get ghosted without any explanation. Since I have stopped making friends online, it's extremely lonely-the kind of loneliness that hurts. I just recently turned 20, so I feel like it's even harder meeting people my age, and I don't have a car, so whenever I try to find clubs or things near me, everything is so far. l've tried building a better relationship with myself, but I honestly don't know what's wrong with me. I just feel broken, and even therapy doesn't really help. I've tried looking for relationships, but it's just been a dead end, and it's exhausting talking to people who only need entertainment in the moment or that try to use you.",

      "selftext": "Hello all, 28 M here.\n\n  \nI have been a very emotional person since childhood. This is entirely due to my family. My mother and father had a habit of nagging me until I cried after I did something. My mother was very angry when I was little. She has gotten over it now, but her anger outbursts when I was little were very intense. Once, I left a soda bottle outside the refrigerator. When she saw it, she got very angry and screamed at the top of her lungs, hurling insults at me. When I tried to hug her to make her forgive me, she pushed me away and screamed again. I cried for minutes.\n\nMy father didn't do that to me, but he did other things. The moment I said something that upset him, he would start emotionally manipulating me, saying things like, “What will you do if your father dies?” or “I did that to my father too. I missed him so much when he died.” To be honest, my father still does this. He is the most immature person I know.\n\nAs I got older, I struggled. Whenever there was a fight in my relationships or a girl broke up with me, I would immediately start crying. This was one of the things that ruined my last relationship. I feel so bad about being this kind of person. I don't know how to overcome it. I'm going to therapy and I see some progress, but I can't stop thinking about my family. For example, I want to move out on my own, but on one hand, I think about the things my father said, and I worry that I might feel regret for the time I couldn't spend with him.\n\nWill this situation ever be resolved?",

It has been a long, wild journey with high highs, low lows, and everything in-between, but overall I like who I am now.

The more work I put into myself to grow and mature, the more I see how few people ever make the effort to do just that. I'm not here to shit on anyone or make myself feel superior, but it does make it very difficult for me to make genuine connections with others, and I've struggled with loneliness as a result. I do occasionally make strong connections, but adult life makes it difficult to keep them in my life for significant lengths of time.\n\nI have no regrets and I'm patient enough to wait for genuine connections to happen, but it's a bummer nonetheless.",

      "title": "How to ACTUALLY Overcome Perfectionism. What I Learned After 60+ Hours of Research.",
      "selftext": "For years, I thought being “disciplined” meant chasing perfection in everything, my body, my routines, my work. If I wasn’t 100% flawless, I felt worthless. I once spent 3 hours cutting my own hair just to “even it out,” and I’ve lost entire weeks rewriting to-do lists that fell apart after one missed task. I’m exhausted.\n\nThis isn’t just about self-care rituals or productivity hacks. It’s the deeper shame spiral underneath, where every minor slip feels like proof that I’m not enough. I realized I had a classic case of perfectionistic concerns, not healthy strivings. That’s what psychology researcher Joachim Stoeber calls the dangerous type: the all-or-nothing mindset where mistakes equal failure. It kills progress. And it wrecks your nervous system.\n\nAfter that, I started reading. A lot. I listened to podcasts. Watched lectures. Went down every rabbit hole that even might explain why I was stuck in this loop. I kept thinking, there’s no way I’m the only one quietly exhausted from this. So I want to share some things that really helped me shift. Stuff that actually made a difference, not in theory, but in real, messy life.\n\nIt started with Dr. Kristin Neff. I found her through The Tim Ferriss Show, and she completely changed how I think about failure. Her work on self-compassion (not self-esteem, not self-pity) breaks it into three trainable parts: kindness, common humanity, and mindfulness. The moment I swapped “What’s wrong with me?” for “That was hard, anyone would’ve struggled with this,” things started softening.\n\nThen came Four Thousand Weeks by Oliver Burkeman. Insanely good read. This book will make you question everything you think you know about productivity and time. Burkeman argues that real peace comes from accepting your limits, not outrunning them. He helped me stop seeing “falling short” as a flaw and start seeing it as part of being human. At work, I’d often freeze before sending something that wasn’t perfect. \n\nSpeaking of CBT, Cognitive Behavioral Treatment of Perfectionism by Egan, Wade & Shafran is hands down the best workbook I’ve used. It’s not just educational, it’s full of experiments. Like submitting something at 80% done and tracking how others respond. Once I did it, I realized the disaster I was afraid of never actually happened.\n\nThen there’s Brené Brown. I watched The Power of Vulnerability while spiraling over a botched project. Her TED talk made me cry. She reframed courage as the willingness to be seen, especially when things are messy. It helped me stop hiding when I felt “not ready yet.”\n\nI also use Insight Timer. I keep it on my phone for short, free meditations when I feel the stress building. One of the guided sessions literally rewired how I handle post-meeting anxiety. Five minutes of breathwork and I don’t spiral as hard anymore.\n\nIf any of this resonates, you’re definitely not alone. And no, you don’t need to be less ambitious, you just need better tools. Reading changed the way I think. Learning every day gives me a buffer against that perfectionist spiral. The more I understand my brain, the easier it is to get out of my own way.\n\nIf perfectionism’s been killing your momentum, mentally or emotionally, please know it can change. And sometimes, the most powerful thing isn’t doing more. It’s learning how to let go, and still move forward.",

      "selftext": "I don’t meet other people addicted to a chatting app. I myself don’t understand where it began, but before I knew it, my screen time had rocketed to 99+ hours and about 64 of those hours were on discord. \n\nI wanted to write this post for anyone who may be having an addiction similar to this one (or exactly the same), because when I was going through it, I couldn’t find anything on the internet about this. It was like I was alone, and it made things worse. \n\nIt began in June, 2022. I was bored, so I decided to join a discord server and just chat with some people. This went on for 2 years. I lost all of my irl friends in the first year, they all told me I wasn’t “spending enough time for them”. Back then, I thought they were over exaggerating, but they really weren’t. The loss of my friends only deepened the addiction. Now that I had nobody in real life, my life was online. My only friends were the people behind the screen. For the next year, I became depressed, I was chatting on discord, addicted and lonely. I had completely lost my path. My grades in school were shit because I never got off that app. My parents noticed, they tried everything they could: switching up the wifi password (I found ways around it), taking my phone away (I purchased burner phones), even considered therapy (which I downright refused to attend). \n\nSomehow, 2 years had gone by. 2 full years of my life completely wasted. And once I ran out of money to continue buying burner phones, and once I ran out of energy to continue scheming behind my parents, I started to accept it. 7 months in with no internet, no social media at all, and no TV, was pure and utter torture. I considered suicide, running away. Many things. While I never got a proper diagnosis, I am about 99% sure that I had depression during that time period. I was self harming in multiple forms, not eating properly, not sleeping properly, not keeping up with my hygiene. It wad even worse than before, or at least, it felt like that. \n\nAnd I honestly don’t know what happened, but somewhere during the 8th month, something in me clicked. I was okay. I had no friends, I had bad grades, I had no social media, and it was scary. It forced me to be with myself, to rediscover who I am, and I realised that there were many things about me I had never gotten the chance to explore. My love for writing stories, skateboarding, art, reading comics, my nerdy interests began to grow on me, and suddenly, I didn’t care that I was alone. Infact, I liked it. \n\nI moved schools a little later. My old school was a toxic environment, and I needed a fresh start. And guess what? I still have zero friends in real life to date. I don’t really need them. It might sound a little sad, but is my own choice. I have come to peace and acceptance with being alone. And a few months ago, maybe 9, I actually did reinstall discord, but not for the reason you might think. I reinstalled it to break off contact with my friends once and for all, more importantly a certain guy that I had grown unhealthily attracted and attached to. I broke things off with him, blocked his account, and I cried like hell. Even though I knew it was for the best, this guy was with me through my depression, through everything. It felt like betrayal. I truly believe that he was likely my “first love”, which still grosses me out a little to this day. He barely left my mind, i made decisions thinking of him, this boy used to show up in my dreams in ROWS like maybe 7 times in a row is the highest amount, i start writing poetry and stuff about him (it feels kinda corny…), i stayed up until late night talking to him, etc. So leaving him felt like a betrayal. I really believed we’d be together forever, and yet, I was blocking him. If you’d told my 2022 year old self that I was blocking this man, she’d likely kill herself, and I’m not over exaggerating. If she knew, current me would be dead, and that feeling terrified me. \n\nI have social media now, discord not included, and honestly, I spend most of my time on it just reading comics 😭 From the most horrific screen time imaginable, my screen time now sits at 4 hours with 3 of those hours on webtoon/comic reading apps.  \n\nIf you want to quit social media, you must reckon with the truth: it is HARD and it will be torture, but the end result is rewarding. To be honest, if I had the chance to go back in time, I wouldn’t stop this from happening, because even though 2 years of my life was wasted, i needed to go through that to help me grow and become the person I am today. I would never change a single thing. \n\nQuestions are welcome, I don’t know if this will reach a particular audience but I hope this helps someone. \n",

I feel so out of place for being like this, when my family asks why I still don’t have a date at this age and why don’t I make some new friends, I just tell them my job is too stressful and busy for a social life, which is 100% true but I’d still be uninterested in socializing with anybody without the job. I’m not sure why I feel this way but I don’t think it’s normal. Even at work, the majority of the times I start getting annoyed and bothered when too many people try to talk to me or when the conversation goes on for too long or just any unnecessary interaction in general. The other person would have to be talking about something I’m extremely interested/enthusiastic in for me to really strike up a good conversation with them. Even though I interact with a lot of people throughout the day (family, coworkers at work etc.) I have no real social circle and I’m fine with being a loner like this even though I feel like it’s abnormal. What can I do to break out of this mental state and be more involved like the majority of other people? How can I not be this dreadful, pissy and depressing person that I am? I find myself even lashing out at family sometimes. What should I do and Where should I begin? ",

      "selftext": "\nHey everyone,\n\nThis isn’t a rant. It’s me trying to make sense of life after years of chaos, loss, and paralysis.\nI live alone, work a demanding full-time job, commute ~2 hours daily, and handle all household chores myself. By the time I finish work, I’m drained.\n\nI’ve spent the past year reading, reflecting, and rebuilding after losing my high-school sweetheart of 15 years to self deletion. She made me promise to not follow. I’ve made it through the darkest thoughts and gained clarity that life is worth living. Even if I am dead inside. \n\nImportant: This post isn’t about venting or reliving trauma. Time will fail me if I quantify the scars life left. My purpose here is forward motion. This account is my alter ego ..  a beacon of hope I’m chasing to make myself better.\n\nNote: I’m not looking for advice about destiny, fate, or trusting God here. This post is about action ... what a man who has lost his heart, soul, and footing can do to pick up the million shattered pieces of his life and fly again. I want concrete guidance, not philosophical comfort.\n\nWhy I’m Stuck\n\nEvery attempt to restart — enterance exam prep, fitness, learning skills ..dies in analysis paralysis.\n\nI have energy bursts late at night from motivational content or short reels .. I feel unstoppable at 3 a.m.  but by morning, distractions and fatigue swallow that spark before it becomes action.\n\nFear of failure dominates: I’ve told some people about my goals, and now I feel like a fraud, like I’m living in the shadow of the “future me” I promised myself I’d become.\n\nFear of messing up, getting it wrong, or failing publicly keeps me frozen.\n\nMy Brain Spirals\n\neveryone else is ahead ... married, masters done...settled... thriving....I’ve wasted my prime years....What if I try and fail?”\n\nI know that giving up isn’t an option. I’ve rebu.ilt before; I can do it again.\n\nWhat I’m Asking\n\nI’ll post on domain-specific subs for tactical advice. Here, I seek human-level guidance from people who’ve rebuilt from rock bottom , who can help me keep the fuel alive and live / learn to fly again as the very foundation of what i know and lived for has vanished. \n\nIf you’ve been here, please share:\n\n1. How did you rebuild self-trust after repeatedly breaking promises to yourself?\n\n2. How do you sustain discipline when emotional/mental fatigue is high?\n\n3. How do you start small when only big goals feel real?\n\n4. How do you overcome fear of failure and public perception, especially after sharing your goals and feeling like a fraud?\n\n5. How do you turn short-term motivation (3 a.m. energy bursts) into lasting action?\n\n6. How do you find rhythm and consistency despite chores, commute, and daily stress?\n\n\nI’ve gained clarity enough to live ... But now I need help turning it into concrete action. Thanks for reading this far. Writing it already feels like a small step forward. I want to be better and make a comeback at life. Please guide. \n\n ",

The people who still end up liking you, would enable you to have a better quality of bondings because those people would like you for who you are.\n\nThis way of looking at life really helped me improve my life and my social interactions as it immensely lifted the invisible pressure I faced while I interacted with people.",

      "title": "Tired of the existing methodologies for personal productivity not working for me, I developed my own",
      "selftext": "I have always benefited from the methodologies and frameworks of others who attempted to dress the chaos and ambiguity of life and the world into something that appeared controllable. Now I’m at the cross-roads where I haven’t found one that exactly works for me, in a modern fashion. So I have developed my own, in a modern fashion. The central question it addresses is: *how to do the things we set out to do*?\n\nThis is a question that has plagued me for over a decade now, and I’ve finally decided to stop running away from it and face it head on. The outcome is the belief system laid below.\n\nFirst, you have to see that everything you want to *achieve* in life will be determined by your ability to **focus**. What is focus anyway? I like the following definition:\n\n>Focus is the ability to give careful and concentrated attention to something.\n\nThat something is your objective. Let’s say you want to get into a good medical school. Your success in achieving that objective is directly proportionate to your ability to give it *careful and sustained concentrated attention* until you achieve it.\n\n**That is really it.** That is the great secret to achieving the things you set out for yourself in life. My methodology asserts that the path to this optimal state of focus is: *(1) building mental resilience, (2) seeing focus as a muscle, and (3) working from a smart task list*. All of these parts come together to *raise awareness* — so that you know if what you’re doing on a daily basis is actually moving you closer to your goals or not.\n\n# Part 1: Build Mental Resilience\n\nNowadays, most people assume that the culprit for our inability to focus is our phones and social media — external distractions. I strongly contest this. If this were the case, then simply turning off our devices should fix it. But the desire to turn it back on doesn’t come from a notification delivered from the sky, its a thought that enters the mind (*oh this is ridiculous, I just want to check my messages!*). I sympathize with the crowd that bemoans that we’ve simply become Pavlov’s salivating dogs and we’re powerless to the over resourced tech oligarchs. But… it’s not completely convincing. To accept that argument would be to underestimate the human mind. The mind is not so simple to be completely controlled by external forces. At the end of the day, we still retain independent will and freedom of thought. I’m not saying habit loops are not incredibly difficult to overcome, just that they are *possible* to overcome. We shouldn’t give up, and it’s not as difficult as we make it seem sometimes.\n\nSo if external triggers aren’t the enemies of focus, what is?\n\nIt is internal triggers. **Internal triggers** are *negative and unhelpful thoughts that obstruct efforts to focus*. This is actually what we try to get away from when we decide to scroll through social media. For example, if you’re studying for your MCAT and suddenly you have an internal trigger that goes: *who are you kidding? You are never going to pass this*. Well, then of course you’re going to reach for Tiktok! That is a very demotivating and painful thought. Social media gives you an escape from your internal world into the superficial world of others.\n\nHow do you deal with unhelpful internal triggers? Thankfully, there is a lot of science to back up an approach called **cognitive behavioural therapy**. At its essence, it disempowers negative thoughts by labelling them and then providing an alternative, rational response.\n\nThat is it.\n\nYou develop a habit of repeatedly *disarming* negative thoughts and your internal triggers begin to dissipate in number, and your focus is sustained! And those pesky external triggers behind to lose their power too.\n\n**Part 2: See Focus As a Muscle**\n\nHow do you get more focus? Simple: you treat it like a muscle that can be trained. You train it by *stressing* it (focused work), *recovering* (rest), and gradually *increasing* load (longer intervals). Lots of research points to the fact that our attention spans actually do expand with repeated, structured exertion like this.\n\nThe Pomodoro timer technique is one of the best ways to do this in practice. It gives you structured intervals of work and rest, both in the short-term and long-term. In the short term, it cycles through the length of one Pomodoro timer repeatedly with short breaks in between (e.g. 25 minutes / 5 minutes). In the long term, it gradually increases that Pomodoro time span (e.g. 50 minutes/ 5 minutes). Practicing like this consistently over weeks and months basically guarantees you build and strength your ability to focus.\n\n**Part 3: Work from a Smart Task List**  \nIn our culture, tasks lists go hand-in-hand with productivity. We are drawn to making lists for some *illusory* reasons (e.g. a sense of control), but there are also legitimate benefits to them! They provide:\n\n* **Cognitive offloading**: Freeing up important mental space for the brain to do other things besides carrying all that needs to be done in the head.\n* **Clarity**: Breaking down vague intentions (“work on project”) into concrete tasks reduces ambiguity and closes the gap from intention to accomplishment.\n* **Anxiety reduction**: Externalizing tasks reassures the mind they won’t be forgotten, quieting intrusive thoughts and lowering the cognitive tension of unfinished work.\n\nHowever, I understand why lists get a bad rep. One is that **list bloat** quickly happens, where items are continuously added without being marked off in the same rate, creating an overwhelming backlog. Then the more overwhelmed people feel, the more items they add. Eventually all the benefits of a task list become stripped away, and at this point, people usually jump to a different app or format to start afresh with a task list of zero. Then the cycle repeats!\n\nSo in order for a task list to work, it needs to address this issue. It needs to not become overwhelming. It needs to induce checking things off at the same pace of adding them. It needs to have intelligent self-monitoring mechanisms. Some features of such a list would be:\n\n* **Begin at Zero:** At the beginning of every week, all tasks are moved out of the active task list to an archive. This means the active task list always *begins at zero*. To revive a task from the archive, you’re forced to rewrite it to be more clear and actionable.\n* **Auto-Prioritization:** The list auto-prioritizes tasks for you by comparing it to your overarching goals and attaching a label.\n* **Feedback:** AI assess your completed tasks and your inputted work logs to highlight whether what you’re working on is actively helping you move closer to your overarching goals, or simply busy work.\n\n# ---\n\nSo many of our thoughts and behaviors on a daily basis are automatic and programmed. The key to changing them is raising awareness. The three-part system of my methodology come together to raise awareness, so meaningful behavior change can happen. ",

      "selftext": "Handling “important but not urgent” tasks is a common, but landmine riddled, productivity paradigm.\n\nHere's a better way so takes three minutes, really, take some breaths, try to enjoy being present. (no sales pitch follows)\n\nThe “important but not urgent” method is all-or-nothing thinking that makes everything a guilt/shame-driven emergency instead of a 'focus'. Urgent is when you go to the ER, not finishing a proposal.\n\nInstead lets see what happens when we start thinking that everything is equally important ... just not at the same time.\n\nLets say Client Projects typically need 50-70% of your time.\n\nWe'll call that 70% Priority. \n\nReading a book you keep putting off, understandable, it's a very low priority (2%?) in the scope of Client Projects.\n\nInstead give reading a different, relative, priority by putting it into the Rest/Restore Project bucket where it gets a 15-20%  priority.\n\nSo when Client Projects reaches 70% of your time you get to call that project done! (for now). \n\nNow we move to the next priority, your Rest/Restore Project which we've assigned a 20% priority. \n\nAnd in that Rest/Restore Project, which changes to 100% because we're doing it, you have:\n\nworkout - 60% priority\n\nbook reading - 20% priority\n\nYou move to checkoff the workout. At the end you take two sentences to congratulate yourself and mark it complete.\n\nNow you switch to the book. Now you're doing reading so it becomes 100% important.   \n\nWhat you're doing now, what you are being present to, is 100% important.   \n\nIf you allocated two hours for the Rest/Restore Project, two hours x 20% - 24 minutes ... so be it, you just succeeded 100%.\n\nYou again accomplished the task so take some sentences to give yourself the concrete feeling of being complete and pleased.\n\nIt feels good, encouraging, to complete something important because it mitigates shame.\n\nShould someone ask you \"What did you to today?\"\n\nEverything is your answer.\n\nInstead of the usual 'well I wanted to read and do this and that but time got away from me' your thinking becomes ... 'I adjusted my priorities, made sure  everything got reasonable time, and followed the plan. Somedays I need  to adjust as I go because stuff comes up but that's normal ... I have a  'Review The Day Project' I do every 2 hrs.'   \n\nTo review, instead of having a Someday bucket, practice the perspective that EVERYTHING IS 100% important when it's what you're doing.\n\nIf you like you call think of upcoming stuff as 'provisionally complete' - in my mind it's comforting, just a matter of changing my direction of focus - like it's a vector.\n\nWork from the vantage of BEING (present) instead of a chore/barrier of DOING (productivity).\n\nWhat you prioritized is what you are SUPPOSED to be doing – you're honoring a commitment and finishing that is a mental coin in your giant blue glass money jar.\n\nThis mindset/framework/paradigm works for me because now I don't feel shame about not doing work for others.\n\nWorking from a BEING paradigm instead of a DOING paradigm lets everything be 100% important ... just not immediate. \n\nBeing before doing (existence before essence - existential productivity)\n\nP.S., When you're present it's always 100% because being itself is always 100% ... you can't not be you, even when you're lying it's 100% you. Everything you do is always being yourself, even if you're pretending to be someone else.",

      "selftext": "*Better life philosophy #11*\n\nRepetition, or as Ed Sheeran puts it 'leaving the tap  that runs dirty water on long enough for clean water to come out', is key. \n\nIf you make 1000 songs and only 12 of them are usable, that's still an album. If you write 1000 pieces and only 2 of them are usable, that's still 2 pieces you can publish.\n\nThe 988 unusable songs or pieces won't matter if you've achieved your goal as your success isn't measured (or watched) by how many failures you've had, but by how many times you've succeeded. A thousand failures are made irrelevant by a single win.\n\nThe person who only shoots if they know they can score is being outperformed by the person who only shows up to shoot. \n\nThink of it like building a house: let's say a good day will have you contribute to laying 10 bricks and a bad day a single brick. Even if you lay one brick a day, the house will still eventually get built (albeit a bit slower) as opposed to if you sacked off trying to lay bricks completely if you couldn't have a good day of laying 10 bricks.\n\nIn doing this myself, solely focusing on just showing up to write, make music, workout, etc, as opposed to only showing up if I could produce results had me progressing way more than I ever could by only showing up on the 'good days'. The bad days had added up overtime and were complemented further by the good days.\n\nThis is not to say that results aren't important, which they are (and goes without saying). But having results at the forefront of your mind means that when results inevitably lack—especially at the beginning stages of getting good at anything—motivation and discipline take a nosedive as the thing you measure your success on is not present. \n\nSwitching to a repetition mindset means that you solely count your wins on whether or not you showed up. Something for which is a lot more sustainable given the simple act of 'showing up' is within your control and not heavily reliant on external factors as results tend to be. When you show up, anything more than that (such as results), just becomes a bonus.\n\nA result oriented mindset will have you feeling as if you have to build the whole house straight away, whereas a repetition mindset solely focuses on laying the bricks you can.   \n\nA mantra I like to use in these situations is to tell myself that 'The only thing that matters is that you're doing it'.\n\nThis also brings up the fact that you should opt for consistency over intensity. 30 good workouts will lead to better results than 5 intense ones in the space of a month.\n\nNow all of this is not to say that you can just keep doing the same thing over and over and you'll get better. You still need to make sure that you're constantly reviewing your progress to ensure you're on the right trajectory in order to prevent any bad habits from forming (because as they say, practice makes permanent). \n\nGiven the above, it's also worth adding that even things such as reviewing your progress, identifying areas for improvement, fixing mistakes, learning, getting feedback, etc all count towards your repetitions for improving in that particular area. Anything that moves you forward in your chosen area to improve counts as a brick layed.\n\nThink long term: Repetition over results. Consistency over intensity. Progress over perfection. ",

      "selftext": "Hi! I'm looking for self-improvement books that are written in a \"professional\", \"earnest\" way. What I mean by that is that most of that kind of literature try to compress the (usually quite complex) subject matter into a simplified form as to make it understandable for mass-reader. How it usually ends up is that the promises are great (\"turn your life around in xyz days!\"), the language of communication is simple and straightforward and there are more real-life examples than any solid advices or exercises. \n\nI don't want to demonize that kind of book writing, I guess that there are a lot of people who like and actually find it beneficial, but I prefer some more theoretical and intellectually honest approach to presenting a chosen subject matter, even if it's sometimes at the cost of readability. In my opinion a good example of such a books is *From Mindfulness to Insight* by Rob Nairn et al. It's written more like a handbook, does not shy away from using a technical language and has a lot of practical exercises to pin-point key ideas.\n\nI'd gladly read other books written in such a manner, I'm not picky about the topic as long as it pertains to the broad category of self-improvement.",

      "selftext": "I M22 have been trying to access deeper realms of my mind using mindfulness meditation for a while now, started about March 2023, when i realised that i have a lot of innate guilt and grief and i wanted a non drug induced way to get out of it, I was a smoker back then using THC and CBD plants to get a high, I have since stopped using it, (info - could be too long here, im trying to write everything after a long time of having worked on myself), In January of 2023 i started feeling the presence of deep inner grief and similarities of mania and shitzo, They came up as voices in my head and inference of other peoples voices not as what they spoke but my own mind turning them into things against me. It was bad till the point i had managed to shoo away the new batch of friends i could have made in college, left me wildly alone with very few people even able to understand the depth of this problem, now the problem is gone and the negative voices have been replaced with positive notes, This negativity however was very rampant and affected my abiltity to mingle with crowds with the spiral of negative thinking making it very difficult for me to stay in crowds without going into a spiral of anxiety, now i could pass by crowds masking this with my ego, i used to work my way up the crowd being all sigma and chad but that was a false mask, people couldve seen right through it, and when i paused for a second when i wasnt switching new people to put my shadow onto, i was spiraling. Currently i think ive reached a fairly stable point where i am able to sit by myself for any length of time, whether in public or private and my thoughts dont race, they are contained and positive and when negative thoughts do arise i have control over the things im thinking, This was reached after so many months of trying to build a confident base for myself and then slowly building my reasons of whys, work which made me feel good, friends who came after i had spent months isolating, isolation was hard, the first isolation after a year of starting the practice led me livid, i was against everyone and blaming them for all the faults, i was trying to find the mistake in everyone, they did do a lot of wrong things to me, they were valid in doing it, i was wierd, but it still hurt, anyway, so i was blaming everyone for the actual wrongs they had done and then also finding where they can be forgiven, for i didnt want to leave rough edges, that isolation lasted 9 months of staying amongst people yet isloating, and then 3 months of pure isolation where i had built up enough self confidence to come out of my shell and be present in real life. Now i have been doing journaling, writing down the mistakes of my past relationships, i had the best and the worst relationships of my life during this period, from the most un-connected intimacy to the most profound love affair, i still love them all when i think about the memories, My journal when written, i got a 6 chapter journal, just for no reason, for a reason i took away one seperator from it leaving 4 normal and 1 large chapter, the journal itself when i now read it has been automatically been divided into chapters based on the way my mind was processing its issues, it makes me think how our brains are wired that resolution also takes place in steps which can be divided, first you solve one issue then the next one rears its head and then the next one, i have changed as a person in the last 2 months, and it is profoundly because i visited every issue and asked how can i change it and then wrote down steps to change it, the guilt was removed by either forgiving myself or life events replaying giving me the opportunity to meet the people i had guilt over or due to.  \nAnyway, if you think youre at rock bottom, good, take one step out, wash clothes, iron your clothes, fix your room, sit with one page, and write it as a letter, bawl your eyes out on that page, write anything, anything just fill the page and dont stop till you fill the page.\n\nIf you think rock bottom is deeper and youre headed there, think of it as an elevator shaft and youre just going down and down, at some point you will have to stop, so extend your arms and stop yourself there, you cant keep going more and more down.\n\nThenks Bye",

I couldn't process my emotions, understand anyone else. I could hardly even muster up courage to talk with anyone and would find comfort in labeling myself an introvert. I am still this but I can now make longer not awkward conversations with people and I understand the importance of stepping out of comfort zone at the right time.\n\nThis past year and a half have been bad but one thing led to another, I somehow feel more hopeful now. I set some goals for myself and realised that big things cannot happen overnight, I need to work for them. I run often now, I try to be polite, listen to people, most of all listen to myself and try to be less mean to myself.\n\nBut I feel like the balance is very delicate... I have really low expectations from me. When just one good thing happens, I move into this state of satisfaction and stop trying to get better. It breaks my heart realising that I feel this way. I don't know if it's because I am always very conscious of my progress. I am really scared that I'll go back to the time things weren't good. I have fallen into these cycles multiple times in the past. Is there anything I can do to stay more confident consistently and believe in me more?",

It just blurs out everything in my head!! Like Foggy brain seriously \nGenerally it only settles for once and all once I react/shout or act upon it (pick up a fight, taunting or any form being harsh and letting the other oerson know that it affected!)\nMaybe,\n-Cause I was unheard mostly? \n-I have to make it obvious otherwise they won't pay any effort cause I'm not important or Centre of attention.\n\nIn short I need an external body outside of me to finally make peace with my emotions! \nI keep on looping same convo! Same situations, same response \n\nI daydream how I could be more savage, or rude or harsh....how I could have belittled them better! (Doja cat's song type of)\n\nI want to develop the ability to wipe out the fog and see clear even while have fog! Yes!! Please help. I can't focus where I should...I escape from take accountability of me, like I need to pay attention to the part of me who wants justice, who wants to be heard, who wants to be take care, who wants attention, who wants attention, who wants reassurance! These voids are another problem eating me up...which I recognize recently! I crave to be valued, understood, seen, heard & loved but it shouldn't be a craving it should be a cherry on top!\nAnyways, \nI've realized two things & it's purpose properly now after being on & off over 1½ years:\n1) Meditation: everyone says meditate this and that...but It never made sense. Like it was overhyped.\nBut let me simplify \nMeditation is a practice which allows you to be familiar to not react! Yes. You sit and you simply exist while your thoughts are being thoughts...you teach your brain & body on how to notice, how to just view, not to attach & identify! You finally make it possible for you to not react beacause pausing is a natural action & not jumping too conclusions too! Possible for you to face the discomfort, the fear, the uncertainty \n\n2) breathwork: same as Meditation never made sense? Like what does it even do? How changing my breath creates any change? It does! \nBreathwork is a practice which allows you to communicate with your body, with your nervous system & to make your nervous system familiar of peace! To integrate safety! Breath is an indication to our brain...ultimate one! So when you control breathe you have the ability to direct your brain too\n\nJust like this I want someone to tell me how journing helps? Like It never helped with resolving my feelings or emotions! It feels like an injustice to me...I'm all caught up! \nEverytime I've looked for it. I got one tip yt, chatgpt, reddit = Journaling \nI don't onow how to general, how to make it work for me? What is a solution which isn't a quick fix but would definitely remove or lessen it to the point that it has no impact long term...daily input & practice type of solution \nI want my life to be better & I know I van I just need guidance & capacity to figure out!\n\nThank you <3\n",

I ‘pass’ but I feel like that’s just because I live in a woke city and have woke friends and no one has the heart to clock me. Whenever I post photos of myself on here (usually on 4tran) I get most people telling me I pass but a couple of people have told me I’m clocky and that I semi pass. \n\nMy problem is that I would rather be a boymoder than a 90% passing trans woman. If I can never get to that 100% I feel like I can’t be happy so I really don’t know what to do. I feel like my ultimate goal is just unobtainable and it’s probably a lot to do with internalised transphobia but I have no access to therapy to work through that.\n\nI can’t keep doing this so idk what else to do. Should I detransition? I basically purposefully harm myself almost daily at this point by going on 4tran and dooming but I just don’t even know anything else anymore and I have an incredible amount of hate towards myself.\n\nI think it all stems from blaming myself for not transitioning younger when there was nothing stopping me. I’m desperate to stop feeling like this and actually improve my life but I don’t know how, whatever I try I end up back here. I’ve waisted so many years :(",

Mental energy is biologically limited, so it is about being efficient with it.\nIf you end your day exhausted, then that is your peak for life, because you will never have the mental capacity to improve anymore. That is why you should never work at 100% capacity.\n\nI am seeing a lot of people talking about \"unlearning your biases to combat discrimination\", but you also need to understand that doing this WILL overload your brain and cause you to peak in maturity and potential.\nEveryone becomes dumb and incapable of improvement if they unlearn biases too fast.\n\nThat is also why you should not be a people pleaser, and give respect only to those you think worthy and important. Because respect is not \"nice and evident\", it costs you dearly. It is like giving away to charity: you can do it as long as you can afford it, but not in excess because that is money you could invest in yourself as well.\n\nI hope that helped!",

I'd put the study videos and the study material in front of me, but when I tried to read, my mind would freak out and I just wanted to NOT continue. I stayed up many times telling myself I would study, but even after removing distractions and putting everything I needed in front of me, every word I read or every study video I watched was impossible to follow. This keeps happening; I can't study at all, and I don't understand why. In the end, all the time I used to \"study\" wasn't being used. I have the entrance exam tomorrow, and I haven't studied a bit. I'm sure I won't pass, but I don't understand why the hell this is happening to me. It's never been like this before.",

      "selftext": "I want to get better I really really do. Im 16 years old and have done nothing in my life. I've been sheltered until now, never even having gone to a public school. I feel stupid. I feel stunted. I feel like a child. I should have accomplished much more than I have. But all I do is just sit in a small fucking closet sleeping and wasting my stupid life away and stay up all night and sleep all day and do nothing productive nothing healthy for my body nothing I do nothing. I hate myself. I hate myself so fucking much. I hate my body I hate my face I hate my personality I hate everything I just want it to stop. I want the yelling at myself and the self berating and the sobbing and wasting to stop. I want to sleep and never wake up but I don't want to die. I'm so overwhelmed. I'm so fucking stressed. My parents are going through a divorce. I'm on my way to washington with my mom so we can liv with her boyfriend stuck in Pennsylvania with my aunt in a trailer of 12 people sleeping in the smallest closet with my mom and I hate it I hate it I fucking hate it I want out of here. My only friends, my BEST friends, my FAMILY are hours upon HOURS away because we all live in different states. We're a trio and we NEVER see each other. It's only ever once a year. And we haven't even seen each other this year. I miss them so much. I'm going to be over 30+ hours away from one of them. I used to only be 3 hours away but now I'm just getting farther and farther. It feels like we're being torn apart by something that doesn't want us to be together and I don't want that. I want to be with them I love them so much. I feel like I shouldn't even be their friend cause it seems like they have their shit together because they're always texting about going somewhere or doing things while I'm just sat in a dark closet at all hours of the day rotting away. Im disgusting. I'm lazy. Im a slob. I can't keep myself clean I don't take care of myself. I don't remember the last time I brushed my teeth. I literally have to be TOLD and when I am I just sit in the bathroom for two minutes because?? I don't fucking know?? I don't have the energy to do anything. I'm out of shape. I'm overweight. 5'3½\" and almost 200 pounds. At 16. Last I checked I think I was a little over 120. I can't do anything without getting out of breath. I can't even move something heavy without getting out of breath. I used to be able to do that. Not even 2 years ago. I used to be able to carry an entire case of water and another inside from the car when groceries were bought without any problem. And now I can't do that. I'm just getting worse and worse. My head feels heavy all the time, I'm always tired, I'm never ever moving unless I'm told to do something or am hungry and want to eat. And even then I hardly eat. I've only been eating one meal a day, and it's only been doordash because of the tight situation. I've lost my appetite. I don't know when I'm hungry anymore. I can go the entire day without eating because I don't realize I'm hungry. I used to have body dysmorphia and I feel like it's coming back. I feel larger than I'm supposed to be. I'm so tired. I've lost passion for the things I love. I don't want to draw anymore, and drawing is what I want to make my career out of. Not to say I don't spend a lot of time on my iPad drawing, but I never ever finish anything. And it's so demotivating. I want to play games. I want to start streaming. I want to animate. But i feel like I'm not interested. Despite wanting to do it so, so bad. I don't know what to do anymore. I hate myself. I can't fix that. I feel like I'm in too deep. Like I'm buried under a pile of rubble and I can't get out. I have a lot of things going on mentally too that doesn't help at all. I have Autism+ADHD, Anxiety, Depression and POTs. And I'm so sick of all of it. I hate feeling myself getting buried deeper and deeper. I never thought of ending it or hurting myself, I never will. But I'm scared it's going to get that way if I don't do anything. And I don't want it to get that way. I know if I did anything, it would hurt those around me. My parents, my friends, my family. Everyone who cares about me will be hurt. And I don't want that. I don't want to hurt anybody. I just want it to stop. I want the mind fog to go away. I want my brain to shut up. I want to be happy for once in my life. ",

      "selftext": "I'm an 18 year old college student, never had a 'real' female friend, let alone a close one. The only girl I'm actually close with is my older cousin, and about this situation she tells me that I'm a great guy, the girl I choose would be lucky and stuff.\n\nThough, I have a fear of them. Or well, I'm confused that talking to them is so different than talking to men. With my male friends, the whole vibe just has a way for me to get comfortable and make jokes that land, make them laugh, banter and all that but when I see a woman a very bad feeling grips my chest. I do not believe this is an irrational fear, and my body feels this way for a very good reason. If I'd try talking to them, they'd just be uncomfortable and stiff, even if I try not to be too awkward myself. My friends have no problem with talking to women though. What I have noticed is that when they do, they become a lot more entertaining, or the style of humor changes. I do not think this is because they're hitting on them as some of them have girlfriends, and even the single ones act the same. They just have clever ways to maintain/raise their status as a \"male friend\" to women. Anyways, I get this vibe that as a man, it's just basic social etiquette to be really entertaining or funny and confident around women. I'm severely underweight/skinny and struggle with body image issues and no confidence, my body language probably signals I'm weak and unreliable, probably also a reason women don't like me. I'm also just really bad at sports and at school people hated me for that, my status as a guy had also pretty much hit rock bottom with my female classmates, I was bullied by some of the guys and the girls would also laugh at me when they did, sometimes even join in.\n\nMy fear also depends on the type of women. I do have a present two well not really friends but women I talk to on a regular basis for/after class. They're both Asian and the studious type, but idk if that really correlates. If it's a \"social butterfly\" or a pretty girl then the fear grips my chest harder. Even with these two, I feel that the atmosphere is more tense/weird than with my male friends. I'm planning to go to the gym and stuff really soon.\n\nSo I guess my question is what's the \"secret\" to talking to them? How much does my body/confidence play a role in this? What am I missing here? \n\nIf that wording gives you the urge to tell me that talking to women is the same as men and that I struggle to see women as human, please give me the benefit of the doubt as I do not think that's the case here, this is simply the best way I could think of to word and describe my situation.

I had an interview today with a fast food place, but I got drunk last night and slept through my alarm and missed the interview.\n\nI don’t really know what I’m trying to ask here. I guess I’m just feeling hopeless and looking for answers wherever I can. Obviously the drinking has got to stop, but I also have all these other issues and I feel like I just need some direction.",

      "selftext": "So I’ve been digging into some neuroscience stuff lately, and here’s something that really hit me:\nthe first few minutes after you wake up are way more important than we give them credit for.\n\nWhen you’re just coming out of sleep, your brain is in this half-dream state (theta → alpha waves). Basically the same brain states people hit in meditation or hypnosis. Your mental chatter is still dialed down, and your brain’s “filter” system (the Reticular Activating System) is just booting up.\n\nThat filter literally decides what you notice during the day. And it takes its first cues from how you feel when you wake.\n\t•\tIf you roll out of bed anxious, your brain is primed to look for problems.\n\t•\tIf you wake up calm or grateful, your brain is primed to spot opportunities, good moments, or just things that feel safe.\n\nIt’s not magic. It’s attention bias + neuroplasticity. But it’s a bias that sticks.\n\nSo here’s what I started trying instead of doomscrolling first thing:\n\t•\tDon’t touch the phone.\n\t•\tHand on chest, breathe slow for a minute.\n\t•\tThink about one thing I’m genuinely grateful for (not fake “I’m grateful for my coffee” stuff, something that actually hits).\n\t•\tPicture what I want the day to look like, like I’m running a mental rehearsal.\n\t•\tSay a few words to myself as if I already did it.\n\nTakes 2–3 minutes. Doesn’t solve your life overnight. But I’ll say this: the days I do it, I notice more good things, I’m less reactive, and I don’t start the morning in fight-or-flight.\n\nYour first thoughts really are instructions. Might as well choose them.\n\nWhat’s the very first thing you let into your head when you wake up—and does it set the tone for your day?\n",

In stark contrast now that I’m living on a college campus, i see good looking women everywhere in abundance. Since i’m not exactly a womanizer and am by myself most of the day, i end up feeling kinda lonely and fomo of not dating a good looking woman in college. For example, i was doing alright a couple days ago until i ended up texting a good looking chic on snapchat, which caused me to lose track of my goals for the day. Quite expectedly she ended up ghosting me along the way and i didn’t entertain her further, however she still lived on my mind rent free the following day, and i’m only slowly starting to come to my senses about the time i’ve lost and it’s just distressing. I’m in the most important year of my life where i’m supposed to be locked in and here I am, getting distracted by the slightest interaction with women.

I've jump from coding (3 yrs) -> marketing (2yrs) -> back to coding (10 years)\n\nI've been out of the workplace for the past 4 years, trying to work on side projects, but its a grind (a 24/7 grind actually).

I did enjoy my short stint in marketing -- i get to think on bigger pictures, talk to customers, but i've been out of that game for a while and stuck in the coding game for way too long.\n\nI have some money save up so i'm not gonna be homeless tmr.

      "selftext": "I’ve decided to use October to create a new routine to help better myself. I’ve struggled with ADHD and depression so far this year and have been in a slump. I’m 19f in college. \n\nI’ve made a routine to improve my mental health, physical health and hygiene, cleanliness, and academics. I’ve struggled with procrastination and not being the best student (not doing the readings. Only showing up to class and doing assignments at the last minute.) I have a 3.5 GPA, but I’ve barely LEARNED anything. My room gets horrendously messy, especially when my mental health dives.\n\nSep 30 I deep cleaned and reorganized my room. I bought a set of printable worksheets that allow me to track my habits, to do lists, mental health, and organize my day. I put these in plastic sheets so I could use dry erase markers and hung them up around my room. \n \nThe routine is pretty basic: \n\nI want to start waking up at 8am and journaling/ working out. Get up. Make my bed, take my meds, wear a cute outfit with makeup, make a drink, grab breakfast head to class. \n\nAfter class I want to spend 10 minutes picking  up my room. Then I want to sit down at my desk and write down my to do list. Then get my homework done, review the notes I took today, and do my readings for the next day. I want to be prepared for each class before I go. \n\nThen at night to unwind I shall reward myself with dim lights, crafts, and cartoons. Then I go to bed at 11-12. \n\nMy worry is not being able to stick with this routine, even if it’s pretty simple. Especially when I don’t want to get out of bed sometimes. The sheets I printed are interactive so I can visually see and track my progress. My general goal is to improve my grades and stop doomscrolling and depressive thoughts by filling my time with productivity, so my free time is more valuable. I want to get into old hobbies.  \n\nIs there anything you’d all suggest to improve this routine or sticking with it? \n",

BUT he asked what is it, can it be summarised. I blurted out we are done. \n\nAnd then he was mad. He hardly sat and listened to whatever I emailed him. Shit I had a point, a year back same issues. But I had this adrenaline and this feeling of sinking all at same time that it felt exciting, I cant say who orange the sky looked how dark the clouds looked and how fresh the air felt and how easier I could breathe lifting my chest, as if a 1 kg weight had lifted from heart.\n\nIt was that good. But I felt I had spoke little too much than I intended. I mean, I dont want to be the one who breaks up. Because it then paints you as someone who is refusing to play nice. And you know, he broke up with me like this...damn He is not attached and this...I have taken in up on me that I wont be attached to him, too. I want that to happen without any other guy in background. \n\nThats why I took it back, I went sheepishly he proved that my opinions and emails are biased and he has hit me and used vulgar words etc, as I have respreaented only one side of the story, and he said he doesnt recommend me staying with him for my own good. Yes thats a threat. Believe you me. \n\nHe isnt a good player at this. He is rough mean and ruthless. I wont survive it.But there is a human faith in me that says, I should stay and then when I without my own reasons on insecurity fall out of attachment, I shall have achieved whatever I wanted to learn.\n\nSince now it hurts. I think fair to say people dont leave until its impossible to stay. So it hurts to be with him and without him, since my love is strong. SINCE i know I am in wrong - well, I am not. But he is morally correct. He didnt ask me to not meet anyone and I was bothered by his female company, and his friends taking all his time. And I asked myself yes its not ideal relationship but why should I make him feel that I was the bad guy? Because I loved him? Also he insisted my family bonding is less so thats why, i tend to be insecure.  So now I want to well guys I maybe wrong, I have failed last four times and I will fail again, but somewhere near the temple or sky, I feel,\n\nI dont want to take responsibility. I dont want to be the bad guy when he is the actual one. \n\nSo the plan is that I will stay away. I will develop in silence. I will find myself. hahaha yes but this jealousu got to go.",

      "selftext": "I spent years forcing myself to “clear my mind” during meditation and failing miserably. I thought I was doing it wrong every single time because my thoughts never stopped. I felt guilty, lazy, and frustrated, thinking meditation was a test I kept failing.\n\nThen one day, my therapist told me something that flipped everything: meditation isn’t about stopping thoughts, it’s about noticing them without getting attached.\n\nSo I tried it differently. Instead of fighting my thoughts, I let them float by like clouds. Instead of judging myself for thinking, I observed. And something crazy happened: my anxiety started shrinking. My focus got sharper. My emotions stopped controlling me the way they used to.\n\nIt turns out all those years I thought I was doing it wrong, I was just doing it with the wrong goal. The hack nobody tells you is that meditation is training your awareness, not silencing your brain.\n\nIf you’ve ever felt like meditation is impossible or that you’re failing at self-improvement, try this: stop trying to stop. Start noticing. Start observing. It feels uncomfortable at first but that discomfort is growth whispering in your ear.\n\nThis tiny shift didn’t just improve my mental health. It changed the way I respond to stress, frustration, and even people around me. My life started quietly improving in ways I didn’t anticipate. And the best part? It’s ridiculously simple and free for everyone.\n\nYour brain isn’t broken for thinking too much. You just haven’t learned the real hack yet.",

When I seek out connection, I am usually the one doing most of the talking and work to keep the conversation flowing. Often I find that I have nothing in common with the other person except for the most trivial things, so the conversation starts to feel awfully forced quickly. Even when I vibe well with someone, usually it feels like we have talked about everything there is to talk about within 1-3 days. For this reason I have never really maintained any relationships or found my people in life. I do socialize still somewhat, but there's not really anyone that I particularily like in my social circle. If someone told me my entire family and everyone I know had died I think I wouldn't be particularily shocked. In fact, I would be kinda relieved because they wouldn't bother me anymore. I feel like a stranger to my family, like I have nothing in common with them, nothing to tell them, and it just annoys me when my mom calls, although by now she kinda got the hint that I want nothing to do with them. There was this guy at my group who died and people were making all the social media posts about how they much they were gonna miss him and I was just... kind of not caring? I didn't know him that well but I never really thought he was a likable person. I wonder if this makes me a sociopath or narcissist or something. ",

      "title": "4 years of procrastination research in one post - by a PhD student.",
      "selftext": "I’m doing my PhD on procrastination. Ironically, procrastination almost cost me my PhD - I spent two years avoiding my work, drowning in guilt, and convinced I wasn’t cut out for academia. Instead of quitting, I made procrastination my research focus.\n\nHere’s the big picture from 4 years of diving deep into the science:\n\n**The Major Theories of Procrastination**\n\n1. Temporal Motivation Theory (Steel & König, 2006): We procrastinate because our brains discount future rewards. The value of finishing your paper *next week* feels tiny compared to the immediate relief of scrolling TikTok right now. The closer a deadline gets, the more motivating it becomes - which is why so many of us work in a last-minute panic.\n2. Emotion Regulation Theory (Sirois & Pychyl, 2013): Procrastination isn’t about time management. It’s about mood management. You’re not avoiding the task itself, but the negative emotions (boredom, anxiety, frustration) the task triggers. Putting it off makes you feel better in the moment  - but worse later.\n3. Self-Regulation Failure (Steel, 2007): Procrastination is one piece of a bigger puzzle: self-control. Just like overeating or overspending, it’s about not being able to align actions with long-term goals. Willpower drains throughout the day, and procrastination slips in when our regulation is weakest.\n4. Learned Industriousness (Eisenberger, 1992): This one’s less famous but powerful: effort itself can become rewarding if it’s consistently paired with positive outcomes. The flip side is also true - if avoidance is consistently reinforced (relief, escape), procrastination becomes habitual.\n5. My current work: Learned Procrastination: I’m exploring how procrastination can become “learned” over time. Short-term avoidance provides relief, that relief reinforces avoidance, and with repetition, state-level procrastination hardens into trait-level procrastination. The hopeful part: if it’s learned, it can also be unlearned.\n6. Temporal Decision Model (Zhang & Feng, 2019): Basically a combination of the Temporal Motivation Theory and the Emotion Regulation Theory.\n\n**What Actually Helps (Tested Interventions)**\n\nHere’s what has evidence behind it - beyond just “try harder” or random hacks:\n\n* **Breaking tasks into subtasks**\n   * When people chunk work into smaller, concrete steps, the task feels less aversive and they’re more likely to start (Blunt & Pychyl, 2000).\n* **Implementation intentions (“if-then” plans)**\n   * Forming specific plans (“If it’s 3pm, then I’ll write one paragraph”) doubles the likelihood of follow-through compared to vague intentions (Gollwitzer, 1999).\n* **Episodic Future Thinking (EFT)**\n   * Guided visualizations of your future self completing and benefitting from the task reduce temporal discounting, making long-term rewards feel real (Blouin-Hudon & Pychyl, 2015).\n* **Reward pairing**\n   * Pairing effort with small rewards (snacks, breaks, music) reinforces industriousness. Over time, effort itself becomes less aversive (Eisenberger, 1992).\n* **Mindfulness practices**\n   * Brief mindfulness interventions increase tolerance of uncomfortable emotions, reducing avoidance (Schutte & Bolger, 2020).\n* **Subgoal + reward interventions (my recent study)**\n   * In a large online study (N ≈ 1000), participants who generated subtasks and paired them with small self-chosen rewards were significantly more likely to get started on procrastinated tasks than controls (Garg, Shelat, and Schooler, 2025).\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* **Why we procrastinate:**\n   * Future rewards feel small (Temporal Motivation Theory).\n   * We avoid emotions, not tasks (Emotion Regulation).\n   * Willpower fails under strain (Self-Regulation).\n   * Avoidance gets reinforced and becomes a habit (Learned Industriousness).\n* **What helps:**\n   * Break tasks into subtasks. Build consistency with small starts.\n   * Use if-then planning.\n   * Visualize your future self.\n   * Pair effort with rewards.\n   * Use mindfulness to tolerate discomfort.\n\nProcrastination isn’t laziness - In my opinion, it’s learned avoidance. And because it’s learned, it can be unlearned. At least according to the theory I'm proposing for my dissertation.",

First off I don't care and secondly I know he's lying. Every time I see him at a party he's always getting rejected to the point where girls just want to getaway from him. \n\nIts actually kind of sad. I said \"where are those skills you were talking about that you bag chicks? \" His reply was \"fuck you, I almost did.  I don't see you talking to anyone. \" and I was like \"ya but I'm not making up stories.\" The funny thing is he still lies to everyone even after I seen him get rejected.  I'm probably going to stop hanging out with him but I don't know whats his deal with lying so bad. I'm not judging him that hard.",

This results in me starting unnecessary arguments frequently, and of course eventually poisoning things. Then with the clarity of hindsight, I’m beyond embarrassed when I realize what I did, and of course devastated at my role in dismantling things. \n\nIn the past I have tried the “wait a day and see if it still seems important before bringing it up” but my over-emotional brain tells me EVERYTHING is important, whether or not I realize later that it really wasn’t, so that’s not a good strategy for me. Yes I am working with a therapist on this (#abandonmentissues what upppp), but does anyone here have any advice? Thank you- and please be nice, I’m here because I truly want to get better. ",

Yet, all this effort is treated as meaningless.\n\nThe hardest part is realizing that removing the crutches (the habits) only reveals the deeper battle: the work on my character. The anger, the impulsivity, the quick tongue—those are the next enemies. The moment I have one slip of the tongue—one impulsive sentence—that's the only thing that matters. My immediate apologies are ignored, and the single mistake invalidates everything.\n\nI feel like I've won a massive, invisible war, only to find the person who matter most don't see the victory because the second war for my soul is just beginning.\n\nI changed my foundation.

Not sure what to do yet but it's something I have been thinking about doing for a while but just never found the \"right\" time to do it. now since I have been actively trying to level up myself through meaningful mindset and improvement changes it feels like i should give it a shot.\n\nBasically, i'm thinking it can be a self-improvement tool that combines technology with foundations of neuroscience and psychology to create an experience that lets you train, challenge, and expand your thinking in easy, interactive ways related to important outcomes in your real life. This isn’t just about something so small like getting \"smarter\" - it's really about using science and evidence based approaches in a fun, easy to interact way that helps us level up in our mindset, decision making, higher-level thinking, communication skills etc.\n\n**Would you use something like this? Would you prefer it to be a game-like interaction? Or a more high-tech type of experience? Or something else?**\n\n**I'd appreciate any brutally honest feedback as I try to form this idea I'm really passionate about.**\n\nMostly I'm thinking the themes of what it would help improve would be to focused on:\n\nExecutive function: developing a superpower that most people do not have - focusing deeply across multiple high-stakes scenarios, juggling deep complexities, and acting with clarity under pressure\n\nEmotional regulation: controlling how to turn pressure and life setbacks into fuel instead of letting them break you\n\nMotivation & persistence: forming a relentless drive to push further where most would quit\n\nPerception & awareness: learning to detect subtle signals and patterns in others that give a deeper lens into how to connect with people",

Like today.\n\nI don’t know if I have any underlying mental health conditions, but I do know I don’t have a very high self-worth, god knows why. (For context I’ve seen some GP/ mental health practitioners, 1 thinks I have ADHD, GP and another thinks I might have anxiety 🤷🏻‍♀️)\n\nI feel bad about myself, feel bad about having people to worry over me, feel bad about making people uncomfortable because they need to accommodate to me and these thoughts just make me feel more terrible.\n\nI’m trying to be kind to myself, be more logical, don’t overthink. But at the same time whenever I feel upset, I get more upset that I’m so emotional and yet, this is just my natural self. I’m extremely expressive by nature and I feel emotions — a lot. My friends/ colleagues always say it’s easy to know my mood (at least for happiness and anger).\n\nWhile typing this, my hb just came in and checked on me, so I got a moment of clarity and feel better.\n\nBut alas, how do you guys manage it? Anyone else has went through similar experience but managed to overcome it? ",

      "selftext": "writing this with pain..here it goes\n\nIn 10th grade, something happened to me that I never thought possible. For the very first time, I loved someone. Not a crush, not some silly attraction like teenagers talk about, but love. The kind that shakes you, the kind that roots itself into your bones and refuses to let go.\n\nWhen I saw her, the world stopped. Everyone else blurred, and all I could see was her. Her face. Her smile. Her presence. But more than her looks, more than her beauty, it was her soul that caught me. Her character, her kindness, her wisdom. She wasn’t just a girl in my class. She was the girl who made me want to grow up. The girl who made me want to become better.\n\nFor her, I gave up my bad habits. For her, I studied harder. For her, I imagined my entire future. I thought of myself years ahead, as a father, and I told myself — if my daughter loves a boy who isn’t serious, who doesn’t know what life is, who thinks love is just what movies show — I would be scared for her. I didn’t want to be that boy. So I became serious. For her.\n\nI cared for her in quiet ways, the kind that never make it into stories. I never texted her late at night, not once past 10. Because I wanted her to sleep peacefully, to stay healthy. I put her above my own wishes. I wasn’t handsome. I wasn’t popular. I wasn’t rich. I wasn’t special. All I had was love. And I gave it all to her.\n\nAnd then came April 26th, 2025. The day she said yes. That date is carved into me forever. I had never felt happiness like that. It was like my heart finally found its home.\n\nI did something no 17-year-old boy would easily do. I told my mom. I sat with her, trembling, terrified, but honest. I told her, “I love a girl.” And I explained — she is not a distraction, she is my reason to live, to study, to work hard. My mom was worried. She questioned me, tested me, and argued with me. For a whole day, we talked. And finally, she said, “I know you’re mature in the partner you choose, but don’t lose focus on your future.”\n\nShe trusted me. She accepted my love. She believed in me.\n\nI even dreamed of the day when I would take my parents to her house. When I would stand in front of her family with nothing but honesty in my heart and ask them for her hand in marriage. That’s how serious I was.\n\nAnd she seemed serious, too. She never complained. She never demanded dates, gifts, or money. She understood my limits. She accepted me as I was. She made me believe love was real.\n\nBut then came June 21st, 2025. The day everything shattered. The day I died inside.\n\nShe looked at me, and with a calmness that broke me more than shouting ever could, she said, “I think I only like you, but I don’t love you. Let’s just break up.”\n\nShe told me that her yes on April 26th wasn’t love. It was sympathy.\n\nAnd then… she blocked me.\n\nTwo years. From 2023 to 2025. Every day, I loved her. Every single day. I turned down every proposal that came my way. Two, three girls confessed to me. I didn’t even let myself think about them. Because for me, there was only one girl. One face. One soul.\n\nAnd she erased me in seconds.\n\nDo you know what it feels like to cry yourself to sleep so hard that your chest burns, but your tears don’t stop? To cry until your throat aches, until you can’t breathe properly, until your body trembles under the weight of heartbreak? That’s what I lived. Every night after June 21st.\n\nI never lusted after her. Never. Not once. The most I ever wanted was her hand in mine. Just that warmth. Just that touch. That’s all I dreamed of.\n\nI once asked her for a photo. Not her body, not anything dirty, my friends begged their girlfriends for n\\*des. Just a small passport photo. Something to keep when we went to different colleges. Something to look at when I needed strength. Something simple. Pure.\n\nI even dreamed of taking her to Greenland. To watch the northern lights with her. To see her eyes light up brighter than the sky. That was my dream. That was my hope.\n\nAnd all of it died with her last words:  \n“If I’m with you, do you think I’ll truly be happy? Do you think I’ll truly be committed? No way. Please stop pushing this any further.”\n\nThat’s how she ended me.\n\nAnd then I learned the truth. She loved someone else. The head boy of our school. Better looking. More popular. More admired. The kind of boy everyone noticed. People told me she was only with me to taste what a relationship feels like. That she trash-talked me behind my back.\n\nDo you know what that does to a person? To realize you were never truly loved? To realize you were just practicing? A test run? A shadow?\n\nI trusted her. That was my mistake.  \nI loved her without conditions. That was my mistake.  \nI loved her without lust. That was my mistake.  \nI loved her with my entire heart, my entire soul. That was my biggest mistake.\n\nPeople say, “She’s not worth crying over.”\n\nBut they don’t understand.\n\nI’m not crying for her. I’m crying for the boy who gave everything and got nothing.\n\nI’m crying for the boy who rejected every proposal because his heart already belonged to her.  \nI’m crying for the boy who sat down with his mother, hands shaking, and confessed that he was in love.  \nI’m crying for the boy who studied harder, who gave up his habits, who chose a better path because he wanted to be worthy of her.  \nI’m crying for the boy who dreamed of Greenland, of northern lights, of a future hand in hand.  \nI’m crying for the boy who never asked for anything more than love.  \nI’m crying for the boy who believed that love was pure, that love was sacred, that love was forever.\n\nThat boy deserved the world. But the world gave him heartbreak.\n\nAnd even now, when I close my eyes at night, I see him. That boy. Crying silently in his room. Hugging his pillow, trying to muffle his sobs so no one hears. Shaking, gasping, broken. His chest feels like it’s being torn apart from the inside, but no one sees, no one knows. He cries until his eyes swell, until sleep finally takes him away, but even in his dreams, he is haunted.\n\nEven today, he has not found justice for his love.  \nEven today, he cries himself to sleep.  \nEven today, he waits for someone to prove that love isn’t just pain.\n\nAnd the saddest part? Deep down, that boy still hopes. Deep down, he still believes maybe, one day, love will find him. Deep down, he still believes love is real.\n\nAnd that hope is the most painful thing of all.",

It's actually that we secretly want ***positive recognition.*** We want people to say \"wow good job\" or \"that's smart\" and when we don't get that, it feels like judgment.\n\n* Here's the trick I started using to step out of my comfort zone:\n\n1. When I'm about to ask for help or try something new, I just assume the person is an expert/pro. So if they judge me, fine... it's literally their role to know better than me.\n2. And if someone gives me a rude face? Instead of shrinking, I flip it. I'II literally ask them \"Okay what should I improve then?\" and 9 out of 10 times they fumble because they actually don't know what to say.\n\nThat's when it clicked that a lot of the **\"judgment\"** is in my head. Most people don't even care and the few who do? They usually don't know better anyway.\n\nI read on book and one line stuck with me: **You're not living to satisfy other people's expectations.**\n\nAnd honestly, that was the push I needed. If I stop living for recognition and start living for me then judgment becomes background noise right?\n\nSo yeeh next time you're scared of being judged then ask yourself: am I actually afraid of judgment or just craving recognition?",

      "selftext": "Hey guys, I (M 28) would like to be a better person. Growing up, I did care but also detached myself from a lot of things as well. Also, being a male//discovering porn early on and having impulsive tendencies I really fell into it. I used to also sext using this app and when I was younger, I had been rude to some women in the past. I never sent unsolicited pictures but would always try to steer the convo towards sexting. I also used to use omegle a lot as a kid hoping I'd find a hot girl or woman who wanted to do stuff but the times I did find someone I felt absolutely terrible and stopped. But then, I'd get back to the cycle again. However, I think I stopped around the age of 17-18. As an adult, I still sexted from time to time but only if the other person was into it or seemed like they wanted to as well! \n\nWhen I was 19, I ended up having some really bad panic attacks and developing ocd. And over those years, I spent so much time wondering about who I am and had so many intrusive thoughts which made me feel like a terrible person. I really didn't know who I was and I had very egodystonic thoughts all the time. \n\nAnd, I don't know if it was due to the hyper-porn usage but also probably a bit due to my mentality at the time: I made women uncomfortable. Then, later on, once the ocd picked up new traits I developed SOCD (sexual ocd) and this type of ocd coined \"Staring ocd\" where I have a fear of looking at private parts, injuries, deformities, etc. Basically, anywhere I shouldn't be. It's very hard because it's hardwired into you sometimes and it feels like you see someone and you're already thinking about it/freaking out and by the time they approach you you're already looking. I work at a gym and I've made both men and women alike uncomfortable. I'm not even interested in men 😭😭. \n\nI'm so lucky, because a lot of my friends who are women also felt uncomfortable due to me from time to time and even then they still decided to stay friends with me. They do know that I have ocd though. Another issue I've had is having an anxious attachment style and really latching onto the people I like. I guess a bit of limerence as well! I know that deep down, there is something about them I really like and that I want to get to know them more. However, I have had the issue of making women I'm interested in uncomfortable and I've been overbearing before. \n\nThe latest thing that happened to me was that I really liked one of my coworkers for a while and someone else was into them too. I was overthinking about it so much and I messed up my friendship with my coworker. She also trusted me and I feel terrible for letting her down. Nowadays, I feel she sees me differently and it was my fault. And it sucks because I do care about them yet I made them feel like they couldn't trust me. She is really sweet and I feel I took her kindness for granted. \n\nI think getting older, and also just dealing with OCD has taught me a lot about what I value. I don't want to keep making people uncomfortable and I want to respect people/make them feel seen. I do try my best to be kind and respectful but sometimes things just get awkward with people. And, whenever I'm interested in someone I always end up ruining things. I question myself so much about what I could do wrong that I end up focusing on doing those things. \n\nAnd, with the OCD doubt and all... whenever I try to do something kind it always feels like I'm putting on a performance secretly for personal gain. Even this post, it feels like I'm doing it so I can prove to myself I care about people therefore I'm not all bad. \n\nI've been in therapy for a few years now and am so much better than how I used to be. (Even though, sometimes I feel like my therapist is giving bad advice because she said it should be okay to watch porn). And sometimes, she tells me I should just be my authentic self for a catch all answer to any question. I'm like, bruh... what!? Though, she really has helped me come so far in life and grow! \n\n-------------------------\n\nIf you've read this far, thank you so much! \n\nOverall, I did want to say I am working on myself and trying to be a better person. I'm trying to be better with how I show up for myself and others. I want to care, be respectful, and also just be myself. \n\nBut, I always catch myself worrying so much. I feel like since I practically grew up watching porn (even though these days I don't enjoy it AS much) I basically don't have a strong image of what my sexuality looks like. I don't want to completely not be sexual but I want to show up in it better and healthier. Without always oversexualizing women too. \n\nAnd, I always worry that I would be a bad boyfriend or I wouldn't be respectful to my girlfriend if I had one. \n\nI'd like to eventually find someone I'm attracted to/like as a person and grow together but all these thoughts and feelings make it so hard. And with my past mistakes, I feel I do carry a lot of guilt. \n\nBut I just want to grow and leave this part of myself behind. I don't want to keep making these same mistakes and having this same experience but sometimes it feels like I'm stuck with them. \n\nI've been trying to work on myself little by little (and have been for a while now) and I've noticed that working on regulating my nervous system has been really nice. And I'm trying to wake up everyday and focus on my goals, dreams, and show up in a way I find valuable. \nThough, sometimes I still get stuck and those times have been pretty hard lately. I think overall, I know what I need to keep doing but I just wanted to get some of this out and didn't know where to. ",

When I told him that I have an issue with overeating, he simply advised me to continue with 'normal food' whilst being physically active, since he \"knew that I wouldn't follow dietary advice anyway\" (this was my first appointment with him btw, he assumed this part 😭😭).\n\nI've began taking hour long walks and following calisthenics workouts from yt everyday, I must say, it does make me feel better and relieves the pain in my joints, however, I doubt its doing much for my appearance...and I believe my diet is the reason why, I cant control myself around food, Im extremely depressed and I need food to be happy, im not doing well in school either so snacking on something temporarily distracts me or sometimes, gets me motivated (with a ting of guilt). I feel that my exercises get cancelled out with the amount of food I eat, its making me extremely depressed. (I hoped to talk about this with my doctor, but unfortunately, my parents were in the room, and they'd give me shit about it)\n\nI want to learn how I can control myself better, during lockdown, I had somehow convinced myself to starve whilst exercising vigorously, I had lost a whooping 15 kgs in a whole year and looked malnourished, it got to a point where I'd check the scale religiously every hour, and even refrained from drinking water so it wouldnt add to my weight. I dont wanna go back to that stage because I was literally miserable, but I dont wanna overeat like a pig either...\n\nAdvice would be appreciated...",

      "selftext": "Hey all, I chose to study psychology as a reaction to me being depressed and going to therapy at my lowest point. The combination of both helped me leave my depression behind. These lessons gave me a new life. Hope it does the same to some of you:\n\n1. Your brain lies to you constantly You're not a passive observer of reality, you are a narrator. Your brain invents stories that feel true,  but often are built on cognitive bias,  emotional residue, and past wounds.\n\n2 is \"what you avoid controls you\"  \nAvoidance feels like relief in the short term,  but every time you dodge discomfort,  you strengthen fear, shame, procrastination, or resentment.\n\n3. You are not who you think you are.  \nYou're who you are. Practice being. Identity isn't a fixed thing. It's a feedback loop of habits, roles, beliefs,  and repeated stories. You shape who you are by what you do over and over, not who you wish you were.\n\n4. You are wired for emotion, but built to regulate it.  \nFeeling your emotions is not enough. Mental health comes from being able to name, hold, and use your emotions, not being hijacked by them.\n\nWhich one do you like most? And if you have any actionable tips related to these, feel free to share them in the comments. I'll do the same.\n\n\\----------------------------------\n\nEdit, since so many asked and my comment with my learnings how to turn these \"theoretical\" concepts into action got buried a bit in the comments, adding them here again:\n\n1. I feel like it's a bit easier with emotions. It's harder with opinions we made, because an opinion is a combination of tons of things we read and our brain kinda just saves what supports the pre-made opinion. I think this is called confirmation bias. But what you can always do is, when you are really certain of something: Asking yourself 'where does this feeling/opinion come from', and how can I find arguments that support the complete opposite way. Kinda dismantling your belief pillars and then trying to dismantle them to get a different perspective\n\n2. Doing stuff that you don't feel like doing is hard. Everything I learned about how to do it anyways, I learnt from B.J Fogg, his book Tiny Habits is a masterpiece\n\n3. Be - do - have. Who do you wanna be? How do they act = do? Do it and you'll have what they have. Identity is what you do and how you think of yourself. So for me it was acting + self-worth.\n\n4. Make emotions work for you, not against you. Luckily we grab our phone every time we are running away from something \"negative\" inside of us. I'm using the Lemio app to block social media apps and every time I end up there, I can use it as a trigger moment to reverse-engineer my emotions. Can recommend the RAIN framework to do so",

      "title": "Perfectionism, Self-Justification, & Burnout",
      "selftext": "(Marked as vent but would really value input/discussion)\n\n=== The Rundown ===\n\n- I (28F) struggle with perfectionism\n- For as long as I can remember, I've felt a strong need to justify my own existence (school/work performance, being useful/entertaining to others, etc)\n- Since ~2020, I've been very intentionally working on myself (reflection, meditation, seeking criticism, facing my weaknesses to turn them into strengths)\n- I think I may have hit burnout, run my executive function ragged; struggling with willpower \n- I am also transgender. Regardless of where you are on the issue, coming out 8 years ago was the first big act of self-compassion I've taken in my life. It comes with its own challenges, but I don't regret it. As you can see, this is another layer of my need to self-justify in an increasingly-divided society.\n- I've lost somewhere between 40-60lbs in the past ~2 years, which I attribute to a consistent level of anxiety.\n\n\n\n=== The Details ===\n\nI've spent the past several years working on self-esteem and boundary-setting. I've made a lot of progress on my people-pleasing behavior, and I can carry myself & communicate more confidently than ever. Yet the more I accomplish, the harder the future looks.\n\nI've become very Type-A, and I went from being the least experienced member of my work team to one of the highest-achieving. I'm even on a path to leadership that I've carved out myself.  What's difficult is that, because of my skill set and general ways of operating, I have been able to keep up with the very high standards I've been setting for myself. Logistically, I can do the work. But it's not without a price - as my standards rise, so too do the risks of failure. I'm in a very supportive workplace environment and I'm grateful for that - I know the remainder of the work lies with me.\n\nI get home, and against my will I have to keep the engine running. Whether I try to do all my errands at once or dissociate into a video game for the entirety of the evening, a constant need to seek a sense of progress prevents me from rest. However, any of my non-work activities leave me with a sense of failure - time spent resting, in a game, or anything sub-optimal makes me feel like I'm wasting precious hours of life with insufficient meaning.\n\nThis has become more apparent in the political environment. Though most of the many people I interact with each day don't seem to realize it, I'm a transgender woman. It's hard to admit, but I'm working on it - I'm actually pretty \"conventionally attractive,\" as well as generally agreeable/accommodating. Because of this, I'm a \"palatable\" representative of the trans community (despite not really having strong connections in the community).  \n\nI feel an added sense of responsibility to be a \"good example\" to try and break the political narratives being spun and help people recognize the humanity of people like me. This has compounded with my people-pleasing and perfectionist tendencies such that I have a very difficult time expressing any negativity or dissatisfaction beyond a vague sentence or two. If I'm loud and angry, my identity is delegitimized and I may be seen as a threat. \n\nThere's more I'd like to say about myself, my interests, and what else drives me - but in this context it would only serve to humanize me and justify my being here. This info is welcome on request.\n\nUltimately, it's apparent I'm constantly trying to justify my existence to others (not just as a trans person, but as a human) through high-achievement, strong character & values, and agreeability - but I'm realizing this isn't sustainable.  I want to do better, yet even that feels like part of the problem.\n\nAdvice/connection to personal anecdotes/resources/etc welcomed. Thank you!",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m 19 (almost 20) and I’ve been reflecting a lot about life and relationships lately. I wanted to get some honest opinions and advice from people here.\n\nA bit about me: I have a physical disability that affects my mobility. I need help with daily things and mostly stay indoors, so I don’t have a single irl friend, and most of my interactions happen online. I can’t really go out I am scared of my health and future i don’t know how long I can keep up. \n\nI also struggle with anxiety. When I talk to girls, I often don’t know how to keep it “normal.” I either make them feel like sisters, or I end up as a “shadow ghost” where they only reply if I message first. Honestly, I don’t really know how dating works in practice, how people know it’s the right time, or how connections build naturally. Online videos about dating sometimes make me feel like I’m not even worthy of it.\n\nSometime i feel stuck in normal communication like i don’t what to talk after greetings and general questions. But when i message to anyone girl or boy i feel like i am bothering them and i feel hesitation. Even if i talk i feel like i am bothering them, i feel hesitation to message boy or girl, i feel myself so navie because most of slangs people use i can’t understand, sometimes i feel i am a joker, stupid, to hope make friends on online or try to seek for dating like everyone has irl life they have irl friend mostly people come on internet just to vent and fun not like me to find genuine friends, what I have to offer time, anime talks, games no one talks about those things always. \n\nRight now, I feel a mix of curiosity and doubt on everything which is good platform cuz my all interactions are online I can’t go out. I don’t expect miracles, but I also don’t want to fool myself. I’m unsure whether I should focus only on building friendships or try learning about dating slowly, at my own pace or give up and delete every single social media account like there no one I can talk with, people only message me when they need vent with me or want to play games, when I need on one really comes to hear me. I feel so bad for being disabled i can’t even do a basic thing, why even I hope everyday today i will make good friend where results always same everyday. Now i writing i am crying and sitting on bed alone. \n\nSo I’m asking:\n\t•\tHow did you navigate friendships and dating in your late teens or early twenties?\n\t•\tWhat would you advise someone in my situation to focus on?\n\t•\tIs it okay to just take things at my own pace and see what life brings?\n\t•\tOr I just give up for making good genuine friends and dating? Because whenever see myself in my phone camera i feel self doubts like why I even doing. I don’t know what to do. \n\nAny perspectives, advice, or personal experiences would mean a lot.\n\nThanks for reading 🙏",

      "selftext": "When I read self improvement books or listen to podcasts, I always feel inspired. But after a few days, the motivation fades and I forget most of the lessons. Then I slip back into old habits.\n\nWhat changed things for me was writing short notes about the key ideas, and then actually reviewing them every day. In the evening I write, and in the morning I revisit them. Starting my day with those reminders gives me energy and focus, almost like a fresh boost of motivation.\n\nThis small habit helps me keep my goals alive in my mind, instead of getting lost in social media or distractions. I feel more intentional, and I can carry momentum for a much longer time.\n\nI hope sharing this can help even one more person stay motivated.",

Am I not capable of being loved? Maybe my character is just fundementally flawed in some way. I just got out of a weird situation with this girl, who was super receptive towards me. Touched me, kissed me, complimented me. For the first time in my life I felt loved, and then last week she says \"I think we want different things, and we should go our separate ways or be just friends.\" What the hell am I doing wrong?

I’m 32M and I can’t see the light at the end of the tunnel. 3 years ago I decided to change my life and paid out of pocket for a coding bootcamp. I ended up getting a job after graduation and worked as a junior dev for ~2 years. I learned that I wasn’t good at my job and I didn’t really love it, that lead to me getting fired. I was shocked when I got called in a call with HR. I was depressed and was unemployed for over a year. During this time I was running out of money and wasn’t gonna be able to afford rent so my older brother told me to come live with him in Delaware until I can get back on my feet. \n\nFast forward to 2025, I started to, and still am, working part time at Costco and another retailer. My sister in law recommended me an open position at her company, a mid size tech company, and I ended up landing the job around March. I felt so relieved and felt like I could start over and work towards my new goal of becoming a business analyst and potentially a project manager one day. I decided to keep my night shift Costco job and also do my day job. Fast forward to August, I was fired again because I was late too many times and they felt I wasn’t putting all my effort into my work. I blame myself for working too much and not getting enough sleep. I was completely blind sided by this and hit a low again. Do you know how embarrassing it is to be fired? On top of that my girlfriend whom I’ve been dating for 5 months just broke up with me.\n\nI feel completely defeated. I work my ass off and everytime I feel like something good happens, I get knocked right back down. Im beginning to believe I’m not built for this shit and I won’t amount to anything. It’s been a little over a month since losing my job and all I can do is grind away at job applications, destress by going to the gym and trying to eat a healthy diet. All my friends are out of state and no girl wants a 32 yo guy still working on himself. ",

I don’t know if it’s self sabotage, or the novelty of starting something new has worn off or what but it’s extremely hard for me to self govern. \n\nI shower almost every night (except on the nights that I’m exhausted after work) but only because I have to go out into the world and I have to be clean and professional. When I’m at home for a few days I’ll take 1 shower in 3 days and lay in bed until 2pm then get up and brush my teeth and make breakfast. If I remember to eat breakfast. \n\nI’m the same way with daily chores. I don’t make a habit of daily maintenance. I clean the bathroom when it’s visibly dirty and wait until I have a mountain of clothes to do laundry. I only do a deep clean when I have guests coming over or when chores have gotten out of hand, and always at 1am when I have a random burst of energy. \n\nI mostly only do things when I have somewhere important to be like doctors appointments, jury duty, work, school work, or personal errands. Only because the consequences of not doing them are great or harsh and I struggle with being on time. \n\nTL;DR: Basically, when I don’t have strict time constraints hanging over my head, or extreme pressure, I don’t really perform well. I don’t know how to be accountable to myself. \n\nAny help or words of wisdom? ",

      "selftext": "Today I realized something important: procrastination isn’t just about being “lazy” or “undisciplined.” It’s heavily tied to dopamine.\n\nEvery time we scroll endlessly on TikTok, YouTube, or Instagram, our brain gets little dopamine hits. The problem is that these quick hits make it harder to focus on long-term, meaningful work that doesn’t give the same instant reward. \n\nThat’s why opening a doc to work on a project can feel so much harder than opening an app to scroll.\n\nSome ways I’ve thought about to fight this:\n\n* Reduce instant triggers: delete or limit apps that keep pulling you in (check the Screen Time app to identify).\n* Use grayscale mode: turn on the black-and-white filter on iPhone so the colors on your screen don’t overstimulate your brain.\n* Make your iPhone a “dumb phone”: activate Assistive Access (found under Settings > Accessibility > Assistive Access). This lets you choose only the essential apps you need and still receive phone calls, but removes other distractions.\n* Replace with healthy dopamine: exercise, cold showers, learning something new, or even a short walk outside.\n* Make work rewarding: break tasks into baby steps. Each small win gives your brain that “checkmark” reward.\n* Set rules for yourself: e.g. “No social media until after I’ve done my deep work block.”\n\nHonestly, I wouldn’t recommend using it at all unless you’re actively creating or making money with it. We need to be more aware of our usage so we don’t get dragged in and lose control.\n\nThis is something I’m still experimenting with - trying to find a system I can keep forever, not just something I switch on when I need to post content, only to turn it all off again and get hooked back on social media for weeks.\n\nI definitely feel the difference when I manage my dopamine instead of letting it manage me.\n\nAlso, always try to follow one simple rule in life: create more than you consume.\n\n* Sell more things than you buy.\n* Create more content than you watch.\n* Move your body more than you sit still.\n* Share more value than you take in.\n\nThis way you make sure you’re always living in abundance - giving, building, and moving forward instead of getting stuck in consumption.",

      "selftext": "\n\nI’m 25 years old. I recently quit college and broke up with my girlfriend. We ended things on good terms, which makes it even harder because we still love each other — but I’m not in the best place mentally. This summer, everything fell apart. We broke up, I couldn’t study in peace, and I started having panic attacks even when I was alone in my room. Suicidal thoughts were very strong, but I couldn’t go through with it.\n\nSo, I made a plan. I want to study dental medicine (I know is crazy hard, but I find it very interesting). I’ll take the next two year to prepare for the entrance exams and learning language, by going to private classes (I'm starting next week), while saving as much money as possible. In country I eant to go, I will take the cheapest student room and try to not spend money. I used to study CS, but because of depression I lost all passion for it. Over time, I even became resentful toward it, despite originally liking the field. Medicine, however, was always my true dream — but I couldn’t pursue it before because of my family’s financial situation, and I had to stay in my hometown.\n\nNow I’m determined to change that. I’ll start working tomorrow and go to the gym on my free days. I’ve quit coffee and plan to quit cigarettes by the end of the month. I’ll continue therapy and start SSRIs to get my brain functioning again as soon as possible.\n\nI’ve already contacted the university I want to attend and arranged for some passive income through state benefits — something I’d been avoiding out of embarrassment about my disability status (I had many operations as a child and still struggle both mentally and physically).\n\nNo one knows about my plan except my best friend, my sister, and my father. I don’t live with them. My sister supports me, but my father insulted me and called me stupid, saying I don’t deserve a second chance.\n\nIf I prepare everything, I will be 27 when I start and 33 when I finish (in hope that I will do everything right). \n\nAm I still young enough to do this? Even if it’s a crazy idea, should I go all in, succeed, and turn my life around 180°? I’m so angry at myself, but I want to do this and prove to everyone — and to myself — that I can make something out of my life.\n\nTL;DR: I’m 25, battling depression and anxiety, and everything fell apart this summer. But I’ve made a plan to rebuild: I’ll prepare for dental medicine for two years, save money, move into a student room, keep therapy, quit bad habits, and work on myself. I want to know if it’s still possible to turn my life around and finally chase the dream I couldn’t before.\n",

      "selftext": "Hey People,\n\nBeen struggling with screen overuse for a while—especially with social media and endless scrolling between tasks. It was killing focus and I didn’t even realize how much time I was losing every day.\n\nDecided to take it seriously and experiment with a few tools + habits. Thought to share what actually made a difference in case it helps someone else:\n\n1. Blocking few activities on mobile – started using the \"Jolt screen time\". It let me schedule focus blocks, breaks, and even intentional screen use, so it felt less rigid and more sustainable. It’s helped me break the \"just five more minutes\" cycle.\n\n2. Daily Check-ins – I do a quick reflection each night: “What distracted me today?” or “Was my screen time intentional?” This tiny habit has been weirdly powerful.\n\n3. Focus Challenges – Little 3-day or week-long focus challenges you can do solo or with friends. I didn’t expect much, but the accountability part actually kept me consistent.\n\n4. Turning Phone to Grayscale – Old trick but still golden. Makes scrolling way less appealing.\n\nSince starting this, my screen time is down by about 40% and I’m finally getting through deep work sessions without that jittery urge to check something. I admit that it's still a work in progress, but it feels good.\n\nIf anyone else is trying to cut screen time or get more intentional with tech use, happy to chat or share more of what’s working. Also open to hearing what’s worked for you!",

I ultimately do want her to be happy and I don't really care who she's with now, not my business, it hurts when I think of stuff, but it's getting better with time. But basically speaking I feel like I will never compare to some random dude that I never met or ever seen. It's not logical, I know, I only heard of him before and I thought we both dislike him by how she talked about him. It also made me question everything prior in the relationship which led to more insecurities, somewhat trust issues and a bit of feeling abandoned. \n\nI just can't get rid of those feelings and I've been trying really hard to rationalize everything and all, but it ain't going away.

I also tell myself that they dislike me. I have a tendency to leave myself out on purpose because I try to make people feel bad for me, which I admit is extremely selfish. I can’t afford therapy rn, I have really close minded parents who think that I’m the cause of all my problems, any way I can get help? Thanks!",

      "selftext": "I'm 16 years old, and it's the end of the year. And unfortunately, my school environment is terrible\n\n I don't have a single friend there (there were some controversies, people I used to talk to turned out to be not so great, and I feel like they're winning because they isolated me like they wanted). At first, I felt anxious about being alone, but now I'm more in control. Before going to school, I take a calming pill, a herbal compound, and every Thursday I hang out with my friends (my real friends), and none of them go to that school.\n\n Even though loneliness has now turned into solidarity with my efforts, what bothers me are things that could affect my grade. Because, to be honest, my focus is terrible — like sometimes I forget to do an assignment and do it at the last second using chat GPT. And as much as that works, I don't want to be like that anymore. I don't like to imagine that the same person who veiledly humiliated my abilities will continue to have the perspective that 'without them I am nobody', which is not true. I want to focus, study, and do well, prove my worth in this way, but I don't know how\n\nFor example, right now we are doing the school fair, and since I don't have any friends there, they're excluding me (along with other boys). I talked to the teacher and said I'll make up for it by removing the decorations, which is true.\n\n I don't think the they'll individually lower my grade (the teachers, in this case), but the fact that my group is badmouthing everyone who isn't their friend, me included, saying we don't help with anything, etc., makes me frustrated\nI hate that environment, the mean comments don't even make me feel bad anymore, they just make me angry to be in that place, especially knowing that the person who isolated me, manipulated me, probably looks at me and thinks they are \"winning\", that lowkey makes me sick.\n\n I want to improve beyond this schopl fair. I want to have a study routine, just like my own, of going out with friends, going back to the gym. I want to improve - and I don't want school to get in the way. what to do?",

Close your eyes.***\n\n***For the next 60 seconds, just breathe.”***\n\nI think it’s a really amazing idea because most of the time we become so busy in our day-to-day life that we can’t spare just 60 seconds for ourselves.\n\nI just gave this gift to myself, and honestly, I felt a lot more relaxed. \n\nThen I thought why not to share it with others?\n\nWould love to know your thought on this:)",

I went through a really bad breakup with someone I thought I was going to spend the rest of my life with earlier this year and between that and work, my mental state was almost ruined. I'm doing significantly better now but I was looking for some suggestions. I have a good chunk of money saved after this project so I was just looking for maybe some suggestions to help me mentally and physically reset for 30 days, possibly more. I planned on doing some traveling, hitting the gym, and all that other good stuff but I was hoping for some others insight that maybe helped them to see how else I should fill all this free time I will have.",

It did feel like a catchy title... I picked it and started reading..  \nThe book was dense with a lot of info and it talked about the mental aspect of work..\n\nAnd it introduced me to a new term called \"Flow\" ... Throughout these years i think studying the \"flow state\" put my career on steroids..\n\n*I understood that a lot of things that has to do with quality work,is just mindset.*.. Yeah action is necessary. but action coupled with the right necessary mindset is crucial...\n\nBecause sometimes in life, even in-action can be the perfect action for the moment. and even some actions can seem like in-action in the same context..\n\nSo started creating a new version of myself the following weeks,   \n\\-Stopped gossiping with coworkers  \n\\-No negative talks(And self talks)  \n\\-No complains about the organisation to any co worker  \n\\-No distractions during work(Solid deep work)  \n\\-Maintaining a calm composure in challenges and internal arguments  \n\\-Always giving the solution to every problem\n\nIn just a matter of 5 days my mood at work boosted intensely,People started asking me if i was doing something different and i look and feel different. I got promoted. Started working on international projects.  \n\n\nI started loving the same job which felt so stressful at some point. ***I really started making an impact.***\n\n***And in 2 months I got the guts to quit the job and start my own venture in the same industry.Ever since,I have been the happiest,calmest and satisfied man...***\n\n  \n***And i really want you to understand that , you have to exercise to see \"action\" in \"in-action\" and in-action\" in \"action\". and when you do that, you will start enjoying things you normally dont feel like enjoying..***\n\nAnd understanding flow state can be a gamechanger for anyone at work,i bet!\n\n  \nThe book I mentioned in the post is :  \n**Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience** – Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi\n\n  \nI can suggest you more resources on the subject if you are interested..\n\nThanks for coming this far,I'll see you in the next one,\n\nMuch Love,  \nM...",

      "selftext": "\nI’m a shell of my former self or at least I feel that way. This year has been very hard for me, particularly in work and showing up for myself, my friends etc.. This is not like me. I’m overthinking and underperforming. I think I have it in me to still change things but I get caught up on what to do, how to do it, trusting my decisions, and dealing with potential letdown. Trying to control all these aspects has me currently frozen in time. \n\nThis year I began intensive outpatient therapy to address to root causes of why I’m like this right now and what happened to make my 2025 so different from my 2024. I ended up being diagnosed with PTSD which is new and something I’m working on in therapy. I may have ADHD but we won’t test until I get mentally more stable because the symptoms may not show up anymore.\n\nSo my question is, do any of you have any tips that I probably won’t come across in my efforts with my therapy? I’m familiar with positive self talk, mindfulness, ways to build/rebuild self esteem, and how my PTSD is affecting my day to day. \n\nI’m not asking for a miracle, a cure, or even a huge step, but a tip that just changed how you approach things. An idea that shifted your perspective? A mantra that helped you regroup? One step in your routine that was a game changer? How the hell did you scrape yourself up from the floor and standup? What helped you persevere and continue the good fight when you wanted to give up? \n\nAny tips are welcome but if they err on the side of something a licensed mental health clinician would tell someone, I’ve likely heard it and it’s likely not working at the moment however, I’m still open to it so comment it anyhow!\n\nMaybe ways you executed those tips would help! Would love some unique perspectives and/or uncommon solutions.\n\nFor more context, I work a front facing job where I’m on camera often and lacking confidence and self assuredness has really impacted my career. I love my career a lot. I miss it daily. I miss what I used to do, and I’ve already mourned who I used to be but there’s no reason to give up my career if it’s something that brings me genuine joy. My symptoms have gotten in the way of an aspect of my life I love dearly. I get frustrated when told to simply quit when my career is one of the aspects of my life I’m proud of and giving up triggers my depression.\n\nHope you all understand. \n\nThank you for reading this even if you don’t respond!\n\n(P.S. I’ve tried the brute force way, the no pain no gain way, etc. so if your tips are like “just get up and do it!” Please share them with someone who will be more receptive! Many people do well with that type of advice, I don’t)",

My life had become a series of doctors appointments, most with no answers. I've had to use chatGPT for advice and have been doing the best I can with my care. I am making improvements in my injury, but have lost so much in the gains I acquired over the months training. I'm a woman and so the muscle I spent so much time building disappeared quite quickly, I lost over 5 pounds in a month, barely leave my room, and I'm not proud of how I have handled this.\n\nI feel like my motivation is fragile. Like, when I'm doing my thing at 100% capacity, I feel I can take on anyone or anything. But when something like this incapacitates me, I find it so hard to do what I can to get through it with grace. I've been ordering in, not cleaning my room. I feel like a disaster. I'm not proud of it. But when I can't leave my bed or do any of the things I love with my body, I feel like I lost a huge part of myself. \n\nAre there books or advice one can give on being able to move through adversity with grace even when the events are very difficult to go through? I hate seeing the days pass by and my body get weaker, feeling like I'm sinking in quicksand. ",

For example, she's like \"what route are you taking? When are you coming back? Are you sure you're going to be ok out there?\"\n\nAt first I thought she was just looking out for us but its how she is with everything. She'll say the same thing about food, bed, shower, or anything that she thinks needs to worry about. If you tell her to stop she gets even more worked up and says \" don't talk to me like that you're being rude.\" She can't understand why anyone would be mad at her. \n\nI'm like \" I can take care of myself, can you please stop bothering me?\" Then she'll ramble on about \"I'm just trying to help, there's a lot of crazy drivers out there and it gets dark early.\" I'm like \"ok good.\"  She's like that with her husband to so its not her just acting like my mom. Her husband basically ignores her and just lets her be upset lol. She has some kind of anxiety but I don't know why she's the way she is . Feels like she needs to be in control of everything.",

These are the things I told myself only to end up procrastinating and overthinking taking no actual action, apart from a few weeks of intensive action which burned me out and led me to not do anything else for the whole year. \n\nIf this is something you relate to, you have to stop making grand to do lists and grand plans of how you are going to achieve the greatest of your dreams all at once. I understand that it is going to be super difficult because I have been there, for years I have made great grand plans, and even though this seems super productive and the only way to go ahead, try to slow down and do less. Make stupid simple plans which might even make you laugh. \n\nThis one simple principle and sticking to it got me to make about 60 videos for YouTube, something that I had been “planning” and “scheming” about for years. It got me to be a 1 percent poster in a community helping 1000’s of people, something I loved to do, to write to inspire and motivate. Again, something I had been planning for years but was not able to do consistently.\n\n It is very easy and simple, but so much harder to execute and implement, flip your grand plans over their head, instead try to do one simple stupid thing a day, maintain this consistently, for me it was writing one post a day, recording one video a day. I was surprised with the results I managed to get with this one simple mindset shift. I promise that this is going to deliver for you as well, all I ask of you is to make stupid simple goals. ",

I feel like I’m really living moment to moment now, instead of a wasted jumbled mess of a life that I wasn’t really present in.\n\nSo while trying to make my life look better and that I’m happy online, I’ve actually made my life better and happier. It’s like I’ve conditioned myself using a feedback loop to keep seeing these small things that I’d have never noticed before. \n\nI don’t even do it for likes anymore, I get like 5 likes per post max. It started out as a fake thing but it’s somehow become real and authentic. Normally people are so quick to judge social media, but if you use it in a healthy manner, you can really improve.\n\nIt’s so strange but it might work for you. Take some pictures when you see a particularly beautiful flower, or a butterfly, or even just some nice clouds or cool looking buildings. You might just start seeing that beauty in places you wouldn’t expect.",

My mind has completely fogged up since 2021, and it’s just kept getting worse.\nI was completely on the right track when headed to college, and that’s when Quarantine threw a massive curveball in my motivation, and I don’t know what the cause was.\nI kept my head calm throughout everything, started a Freeform Dreadlock journey and kept myself occupied with exercise, cleaning, and my education, and let me tell you, I started feeling really strained mentally.\nEducation was a nuisance since the school had no clue on how to prepare for something like that, and everyone was so disoriented.\nThere were students just dropping from the school because they were dissatisfied, sending group emails for every student to see, and I knew where they were coming from because I had the same qualms.\nI graduated High School with a 4.3 GPA. I was ready for more. I didn’t get a prom also, or even a genuine graduation ceremony, as it was just a PowerPoint presentation on YouTube. \nI dropped out of college and spoke with my advisor, and dean about my decision. And it seems like they weren’t on top of things because I kept getting letters and emails about  how my GPA was dwindling because I wasn’t attending classes.\nMy dreadlock journey went into shambles after I accidentally used conditioner and it really messed my hair up, and I had to shave it off and regrow it.\nI ended up getting a job at Lowe’s and it was atrocious. I had no hours, and spent my birthday working there because it was one out of the 3 days they had me in that week, and it was my longest shift for that week.\nI got into a serious financial argument with my mother and ended up moving out to my girlfriend and her parent’s place.\nThat location sucked to live in. It was the most broken home I’ve seen, and it was so disorganized, and they were like money vultures, and had no incentive to clean up the house they were living in, which I couldn’t handle cleaning myself with my girlfriend. The cleanest room in that whole house was ours.\nIt looked like an episode of hoarders.\nBy this point I stopped working out and started picking up bad habits like nicotine addiction, and was smoking up an ounce of weed every week just to keep my mental sane.\nAll this did was fog me up mentally, and I quit it, but then I didn’t go into good habits because of lack of motivation.\nThe only good news I had at this time too was that my girlfriend was pregnant, and unfortunately we lost it due to the stress of that household.\nI tried picking up religion but couldn’t commit, and I called my mom again.\nShe told me that we should just come back and not to worry about money anymore because she was past that, and just wanted me to get my US citizenship and try to get back to Dominican Republic with my now Fiancé, and have a kid there for peace of mind. My motivation came back, and left again after I was laid off from my job because our store wasn’t making the 150 million that corporate wanted (at least that’s how I saw it. We were only short 50k).\nSo now I’m back at living with my mom, and fiancé at our small apartment where rent is 3200$/ month for a 2 bedroom and I’m still looking for a job.\nI found one for sales, went through interviews and got hired on the spot, but it was a scam job, and now I don’t have motivation anymore.\nMy nicotine addiction has gotten worse, and my bank is at 0. With only my fiancé helping pay bills, and no one’s hiring without a doctorate in my area.\nI have bad credit because I can’t finish paying off my loans from the 1 quarter semester that i did in college. I have 0 motivation to exercise, 100 motivation to work, and 100 motivation to go back to school and get my life together, and now it just seems like there’s nowhere else to go. I am completely lost, and I just keep seeing my peers who I grew up with getting married, being successful in life, while I’m\nJust here. The only upside right now to my life is that my Fiancé is supportive, and wants me to get a good break, my mom, and my cat. \n\nI just want clarity.\n\n",

If I'm holding my daughter and someone tries to hug her, I stop the situation and ask my kid if she wants to hug them and tell her she can say yes or no. Otherwise, it's a no. My MIL once said she'd watch our daughter if I shoveled, I said no to that because at the time we hadn't had anyone watch our daughter yet. \n\nMy most recent people pleasing was a man that I've seen walking in our neighborhood a few times a week. He stopped us walking a few months ago and got in my daughter's face who was in the stroller, and was baby talking her. I said she doesnt talk to strangers and shes 3. He asked if I was her sister, I said no. I'm her mom, I'm 28. He said he thought I was 17. Which I realized after was really weird that he'd approach a toddler and teen to day hi? Anyway, he waves when he walks by so I wave back. The other day he stopped by our fence (not on our property there's a 2nd fence separating my property from our neighbors and the road, he was at their fence) and he asked if we like apples. I said yes. He said he had an apple pie recipe and an apple tree out front of his house and said we could pick apples sometime. Like the people pleaser I am, just trying to get him away I said, that sounds nice. Then he asked when we'd be coming and I said we just got apples from our neighbor (truth). He said to let him know when we'd be by. I said I cant leave the puppy (we just rescued a 3 month old puppy from a kill shelter). I never technically agreed to going. But now I've had two conversations with this guy. Both very uncomfortable for me. \n\nI guess I just need help. I dont agree to not hurt people's feelings. It's not that deep. I just cant figure out how to say no. I know I can just say no. But I literally cannot. Please don't tell me to just say no. I need help. How to I get a back bone? Is there anyone else who experienced this and overcame it? I am not a strong person. I truly worry about my safety because I agree so much. \n\nMy first kiss when i was a teen, i agreed to it ahead of time but the moment happened, i didnt want it but still let it happen.

Physically I’ve grown, my age keeps ticking up, people around me are building lives, but in my head it’s like I’m still 18 or 19. It feels as if my mental operating system froze somewhere in the late teens while the world kept upgrading.\n\nI can handle responsibilities when they’re right in front of me, but deep down I still feel like I’m pretending at adulthood instead of actually living it. My first instinct is usually to withdraw rather than act. I’m an extrovert by definition. I like being around people, I can talk and socialize, but most of the time it feels performative, like I’m acting out a version of myself that knows what it’s doing.\n\nIt almost feels like there was supposed to be a rite of passage I just sprinted through. Moments that should have been transformative just blurred past while I was busy holding my breath and pushing through. So here I am, outwardly the right age, inwardly stuck in this time warp, watching peers glide through things that still feel foreign to me.\n\nThis disconnect between how I feel and how I’m supposed to feel makes me question everything. Does anyone else feel like this, like you grew older physically but never really leveled up mentally? And if yes, how do you actually bridge that gap, or do most people just fake it better than me?\n\nHow do you build the sense of agency that seems to come naturally to some?\n\nTL;DR: I’m 25 but still winging it like a 19-year-old",

      "selftext": "First and foremost, I do have Autism and adhd, so there will be a lot of things I say that a lot of you might not understand, and vice versa.\n\nAnyway, how many of you all were true absolute losers in school and early adult life, but actually brought yourself back and got to enjoy your early adulthood? \n\nFor me, I've been the stereotypical nerdy kid turned angry bitter loser for a while. I was bullied for being ugly at a young age, so we can check **low self-esteem** off the list. My parents had a horrible relationship and I was caught in the fighting a lot, so it's no surprise that I'm **scared to act on anything** out of fear of what may happen to me now. My first ever \"would be\" girlfriend ended up basically cucking me infront of basically the rest of my grade, so we can check **relationship and trust issues** off the list. All of this of course makes my overall personality suck of course.\n\nStill never learned correctly how to speak to other people before and after all of that, so that's **extreme social anxiety** too. On top of that, I'm not particularly talented at anything worth acknowledging according to society, nor am I all that interesting to begin with.\n\nThe worst parts come from my mental disabilities though. My adhd is so weird, i struggle to figure out why I can study something, understand it in theory, practice it, and still completely do it wrong multiple times. Executive dysfunction is a curse. I've been suffering so long, and I desperately want to be able to fight for what I want in life, but I always mess up. Every single time. Even when I try to do good, life seems to make sure things out of my control don't work in my favor. \n\nWhat do you mean, uber doesn't work now that I'm in desperate need of a job, you worked every other time!? I know comparison is often seen as bad, but it's kind of hard to ignore it and not call yourself ignorant when you're reminded by how much you suck at life, all the time.\n\nThat brings me to Autism. Why do I have to have such a strong (yet still hazy??) memory for only the bad moments? I can barely remember some of the things I did yesterday, but I still remember my dad tossing me like a ragdoll. I have such a hard time understanding basically intrinsic concepts that other people clown on me, like I'm a retard. Often people have a hard time understanding what I mean by something, so of course it goes both ways and I'm never truly heard.\n\nFast forward to now at 21, I have no money for rent, I still can't find a new job, and I'm probably gonna have to move back in with my parent's a 3rd time or go homeless again in a week. Its def gonna be so much fun.\n\nYes yes, I should be grateful I wasn't born with cerebral palsy or whatever sucky condition, but let's not pretend this life is anything to gush over.\nI don't need suffering to be empathetic towards others that also suffer, its already common sense.\n\nI wanted to do *that* thing plenty of times, but of course, I'm too much of a pussy on that too, so I can only assume I must have been a pretty shitty person in my past life to get all of this. In which, I'm about ready to continue the cycle and crash out.\n\nNow, how many of you came back from shit like that and still had time to enjoy your young years? Because if I have to wait until I'm 30 or 40 to just 'live' comfortably, I think it's high time I got proactive.",

      "selftext": "Context: I'm 23(M) who left his 4 year relationship 6 months ago. I've been self improving myself for 3 years now and off social media for 2 and a half. After I finished university I returned to my countryside hometown, which is in the least populated region of my country. Still I am not complaining, just trying to figure out my next moves and seeking guidance.\n\nBack on the dating marked and I am trying to understand what part social media (Facebook, Instagram..) plays in finding a partner and should I improve in it. Most of my male friends use their socials, yet they still don't go to dates or hang out with women. On the other hand, I started to reach out to old schoolmates and friends on chat apps (WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger) and was able to land some dates, which went well and fun, but there really small chance of relationship since we are either not compatible or the other person is not emotionally available.\n\nSo I made the conclusion that I need to meet new people and I started using Facebook from time to time and I got bombarded with friend suggestions of attractive girls. The thing is that most of the people my age moved out of town and I rarely have common friends with the suggested people. Tried to connect to one or two people, but had no success since I don't invest much time in developing my social profiles.\n\nAnother thing that I have tried is cold approaching. I was on a business trip to one of the bigger cities in my country and was able to cold approach two girls along with my friend which resulted in 1-2 hours chatting with them, but got instantly turned off by the one I liked, so I didn't exchange contacts. Tried cold approaching a group of girls with my friends in my hometown, but since social people in their 20s are kind of extinct here, the girls couldn't maintain a conversation and seemed uncomfortable we decided to back off after talking for a bit.\n\nSo I am standing on a crossroad trying to figure out what to do and I think my options are the following:\n\n\\- Continue trying to \"slide into DMs\" hoping someone will reciprocate;\n\n\\- Hire someone to develop my social media profiles and do the chatting and reaching out myself;\n\n\\- Try dating apps and travel to nearest big city to date (since dating apps aren't really popular here);\n\n\\- Travel to nearest big city to cold approach and attend social gatherings;\n\n\\- Hope for a miracle in the future.\n\nWhat can I do to improve the chences and the success of meeting new people? Do you think social media should be a part of your self-improvement journey? Have you tried any of these approaches and what was the result? Do you have friends in similar situation and how did they resolve it?",

      "selftext": "I recently had a breakthrough a few weeks ago that has led to several more realizations. I have kind of always viewed myself as a confident, bubbly, generally positive person. I forgive easily, am pretty patient, and very slow to anger. I'm starting to think I'm actually just a hypervigilant people pleaser who uses bubbliness and perceived openness as a way to avoid true vulnerability. I exaggerate without meaning to, I can change myself to fit whatever personality I want to be at any given time, and I am feeling really overwhelmed with where to start. The most absurd part to me is I only really behave this way when I'm in a romantic relationship. I have had some bad relationships in the past. I am currently in a really great one. I did as much healing as possible while single but I guess there's a whole bunch more healing and unlearning to do now that I'm in a relationship again. Does anyone have any similar experiences or advice? I hope to go back to therapy soon but there is a pretty long waitlist to see anybody in my area. The other part of this situation that is stressful to me is I don't know if I really AM a people pleaser or if I just have convinced myself that I am one because I am so good at morphing who I am. I can't tell if I genuinely am this way or if it's just another way to self sabotage. I thought I knew who I was and I thought that I couldn't lie to myself, but here we are. I want to become more authentic either way. I think it will help me figure out who I am. I also hope it will help me stop unintentionally wearing so many masks. I want to be honest and not exaggerate. I want to not put myself in a box and act to satisfy the role. ",

I called him a baby for getting so mad over a video game and he proceeds to mention other things within the game I got mad about.\n\nI felt it was a personal attack and just dropped it while being a bit petty saying stuff like „whatever lets you sleep at night.“ I wanted to drop it so I didnt say anything else and he didnt either.\n\nNow that out of the way, it still bugs me how he reacts that way over, in my eyes, so little things and makes it personal really quick. Aside from the fact about him, I realized just how petty I can get over those same small things that bug me and tend to hold onto it, like I do right now (For context, it happened days ago and still bothers me). \n\nI do feel like I for one am a relative sensitive person and I get pissed at things a lot which I want to change or rather work on. Just looking for ways on how to handle those things better than just lashing out at the moment others do. I know cant really change who I am but I also know that I can change how I react on things. I just am clueless on ways how to do that.",

      "selftext": "  Hi everyone 26(M), i know i made post not to long ago on this community going on me pretty much having a kinda of panic anxiety episode of me feeling im stuck in my life i couldn't do anything about it, in some aspect yeah it did really felt like it but i think i want to talk about of the things i was able to achive in these past years as i know writing down stuff like this is not a bad idea  as way to ket out my negative feelings i have now feeling things are not just not ok but i want to hang in there as i feel there is a way for me to get myself back up in life.\n  \n    So many years ago my mom was able to get me my Ssi from social security, with this i was able to get of course money and since i was living with my Mom and dad at the time and i still am to this day i was giving lots of time on my hands. So naturally since i was raised to be a mindful and responsible person my thoughts was \"Ok me you were giving this stuff and fortune to have it. Its a good idea to use it well and help myself get back up in my life\" in my opinion even though i tried i felt i could of use this time more better but still i did a ok job. But what i did i look around my own environment in my life if what options i have and questions of things i can do and have in my disposal to pick myself back up in life and this is what i was able to find and to accomplish:\n   \n\n -I was able to get my mons old card in getting it fix to work again, and I've been in good position in getting back up moving again im still working on it with my dad but its at a point its getting to be moving again. The best part is that the car has been all paid out so i dont have to worry about making monthly payments which is grate for me financially even though yes it may be a small thing for a financial wise but its a grate step non the less.\n\n\n\n-I was able to know these options i have for my ssi:\n•I can change my Payee to someone else than my mom who is my payee.\n•I can maje myself my own payee which is good meaning i can manage my own money from ssi without no one managing my ssi stuff.\n•I know i can have my brother be my payee as we im know each other for years and he a good person.\n•Im not sure but ive learn i can find work while i have my ssi Active.\n\n\n-i found out i can get workforce help in finding work but as well i found out i can get Vocational Rehabilitation Services(VRS) which is that is fantastic news as (VRS) can help me find work but also fund for any course i want to pursue which is good news really.\n\n\n-i talk with my brother as not only he can be my payee but also hes fine i can move in with him at his appartment tbf thats something i would talk about how it can be done but thats still good news none the less. Also ive been told by my family members that my brother where he lives can offer me some work which is also good to know.\n\n\n-I also convinced or more like talk with my mom in making my brother my payee which is good news considering what ill go into later in here in this post.\n\n\n-Also i try but when ive been try my best in trying different stuff ive found out that ive been really enjoying psychology i been loving knowing and studying how and why people react and behave and my Tharapist even notice how excited about when i talk about in studying how people communicate, interact and react to the whole which this is a good thing as psychology is in the medical field and its seems not bad career for being paid well but i should spend more time in psychology like stuff to be sure its something i realy want to keep doing in my life but i would love recommendations of any of you guys on this really.\n\n   Not to mention me going to look at stuff like this actually helped me in how to talk better to people which was something i was very bad at as it was one of things i saw need to be better at when my Tharapist flund out and diagnosed me as autistic which is good for me that i did use the time god gave when i got my ssi to fix it.\n \n\n   -Also ive been doing a good job in budgeting my money or how to handle and spend it and use the money for stuff i need took take care of in my life or savings.\n\n\n\n\n  Now this are all good steps i achive in my life over these years since i got ssi i do want to talk about some of the unfortunate news. As i talked before here on this post my mom is my payee and its a problem since she has a Crack Cocaine addiction and gotten delusional infestation from this and I f course this was not good for me and my health. She lied and manipulated me to give her money to even at points she straight up took money from my bank account without my say or consent she took tons of my money i wanted as savings over these years, and even she thrown stuff and Physically hurt me because i didn't give her money so she wont go to jail because she forgot to go to court multiple times. Of course i already mentioned how ill have my brother be my payee instead mom so this wont happen anymore but ive been looking at being my own payee but its seems my brother will be my payee but i dont mind your guys thoughts.\n\n  As well my dad has retired and is getting older  and can only do some much at the house his fine but its not bad to reconsider i can look if i can take care of myself like my brother did.\n\n  Well thats it and really this was good to let it out here but i would like you guys advice on whst i can do?\n  As at this pont i do feel stressed as this metaphorical clock is ticking and its making me have these Anxiety filled Stress out episodes everyday so bad i would go to sleep and call it a day and this Cylce completes. I feel like i cant come up with anything to get myself out this problem and to be able to get out of my house and town as it a bad environment for my health and start living my life as a responsible adult who can take care of himself.\n\n\n  The only thing i can think of is get my brother as my payee, get car fix, go get a job and look into getting a psychology like degree as my Tharapist told me that i need to find a job that makes me happy and pays well. But i would love your guys help in suggestions and ideas as i really need it i feel like i dont know what to do and im scared, i want to be able to help myself get back up in life.",

They only really talk to me if I’m alone with one of them. I’ve tried hanging out with them and their friend group but they all just ignore me.\nSchool saddens me but home does too. Because I have no connections outside of school, I’m super lonely. \nAll my siblings have pretty much left home. I’m like an only child. And my mother works quite a lot. \nI don’t know what to do with myself. I do my chores on a Sunday, but stay in bed as long as possible before doing them. 11:30am almost all of the time. \nI watch tv, finish movies and never know what to watch next. I play games but get bored super quick. Then I end up scrolling on TikTok so I delete it to avoid it but then find other things to scroll on like YouTube, Insta, Reddit. \nI never have the inclination to read, studying feels impossible despite exams coming up. \nWhen I do it I crack on with it but the lack of motivation and happiness is pretty overwhelming. I don’t know how to break this cycle. \nI guess when I leave school it’ll be easier but I’m searching for any advice from anyone who’s been in the same boat. Thankyou! \n",

I hit it while trying to reverse in a tricky place. It wasn’t even a hit, I just grazed it against the fence. I don’t think I damaged the fence, and I believe the damage to the car isn’t big. But I feel awful. I feel like everyone is judging me and thinking badly about me, that I’m a bad driver, that I’m clumsy, that they pity me.\n\nI hate how upset I got and I am afraid someone noticed. I hate that I stared shaking and try to cover everything with humor. I hate my forced laugh that I just know it looked like a grimace.\n\nI keep telling myself that I’m not the only one who has ever hit their car. Bigger accidents happen to experienced drivers. I remind myself that I’ve learned a lesson: to listen to myself and not to other people. I had been given advice from non-drivers on how to exit that space, and by following it I hit the car.\n\nExperienced drivers don’t go all the way into that driveway because it’s tricky to get out. A family member even said they had the same issue and barely got out without damaging their car.\n\nBut all of that doesn’t help. I want to crawl out of my skin because of my mistake and the fact that everyone knows about it. So many people saw me make it. Because of this, I avoid going out to practice driving. I’m afraid people will see me make a mistake and say things like, “Who gave her a driver’s license?” or make comments about how women are bad drivers. I’m writing this here because I need advice on how to overcome this. It’s not just about what’s happening now. Whenever I make a mistake, or when something bad happens that’s out of my control, I end up beating myself up and having thoughts similar to the ones above.\n\nI go to therapy, and my therapist says I need to notice my thoughts and recognize that they’re only thoughts, not facts. I notice them. I know that I’m exaggerating. I know that the people who saw me, and the ones I told the story to, have already forgotten it. I know my family isn’t mad at me. I know my friends are probably not judging me, because they’ve also had bigger accidents happen to them. But no matter what, I can’t stop these thoughts. My insecure part feels so much stronger than my “healthy” and rational part. And right now, it’s actually good. It’s good that I even have one “good” thought, since usually that’s not the case.\n\nI’ve tried writing down my thoughts, journaling, distraction, but nothing sticks. I just can’t turn it off.",

As I grew up I realized that this mindset was a trap that had been holding me back at all my pursuits.\n\nI would make a super productive plan, integrating 3-4 skills all at once, every single time I would end up not being consistent and burning out. My ambition and the desire was not wrong but my approach was.\n\nHere is the simple mindset I adopted that has actively changed the way I do things now, as a result I have successfully been able to get great results like actually sticking to my habits and getting things done.\n\nDrop the perfectionist inside you:\n\nStop trying to do too many things all at once and setting goals that you know are too much for you and will never be sustainable even if you do them for a few days.\n\nSet little goals, so little that they seem stupid. I did the same, I wanted to write and make videos for content, I spent 3 months trying to make a perfect plan, no content uploaded.\n\nI set a goal instead to upload content daily no matter how bad it would be, and write daily. I have got consistent as a result and have even surpassed my expectations in some aspects.\n\nRemember, if you try to be everywhere at once you will be nowhere at all.\n\n",

      "selftext": "I am unable to express my real self and live the way I want to because I'm ugly. Help me to get out of this\n\n22F. I've been an hikikomori for 8 years after being bullied for my appearance, with all the issues it entails (lagging in social experience etc...). \n\nDon't start with saying “you're probably not that ugly”. I have a hooked honcer paired with a recessed jaw and maxilla (class II malocclusion), and crokked yellow teeth. I look like Caroline Ellingsen, but worse. People tell me I look like Elly Schlein, but obviosuly worse, and I WISH I had her face, her side profile is actually good but mine is awful. \n\nBoth of those women get ripped apart by the general public for their appearance, and this makes me feel like I am not allowed to exist or expos myself to the public.\n\nThis pains me greatly because my dream job involves interacting with many people and do public speaking, and I am terrified of doing it. I've already been pubicly humiliated by the entire class in junior high and I fear that it might happen again if I pursue my dream job, but this time on an even larger scale.\n\nSocial gatherings and groups terrify me for the same reason, that's why I never went to a nightclub, despite loving music and dancing being my passion.\n\nI cry day and night because it's as is I can't pursue what I love in life without being shamed and being turned into a laughing stock.\n\nThe same goes for my personality. I can't express who I actually am because I feel I'm forced to stay in the ugly box and behave the way an ugly person is expected to behave.\n\nWhen I was able to still be authentic, vulnerable, expressive and genuine, when I still wasn't aware I needed to fit into the “ugly box”, I was able to attract some boys who liked me. But now that even my personality has been taken away, I can't even attract anybody anymore. I am terrified of expressing myself again and attract attention. \n\nMy real personality is not the type of personalitt society wants people like me to have. I am not humble, I am timid, I am not insecure. I am actually kind of a prima donna. That isn't to say that I would be an asshole, just that I would have an infinite amount of confidence and self-assuredness, that I would not fear interacting or confronting anyone, and I would be fearless, proactive, extroverted and friendly. \n\nI would feel more confident in my sexuality instead of completely repressing it and behaving as if I'm asexual or like I don't have any emotional needa or need for acknowledgement and appreciation. I rejected a handsome man for the same reason (and this is the only time I've attract am handsome man, and only after he spent time with me for 8 months, the only way I can attract a small percentage is if they spend many months with me, and this was when I was able to express myself authentically, but now I behave like smooth Spongebob or like an NPC in every interaction). \n\nI am unable to express my attraction and sexuality, and I don't want to be seen with a handsome man by other people, since I've been demeaned in the past by his social circle for my appearance, since it doesn't fit the box I'm supposed to stay in. \n\nI know people who want me to stay in my “ugly box” and just not exist are cruel people who do not care about my own well-being. But when I get the message that I'm worthless, I'm just paralized and I can't do and behave how I want.\n\nThis problem is fixable through surgery, a dpuble jaw surgery. But I can't afford it right now and I won't be able to for a long time, I'm currently working on getting money for braces and palate expanders. I don't need to be beautiful to have the courage to live, just to have and average face. I don't even need a rhinoplasty, just a jaw surgery to fix my deformation. \n\nBut since I can't afford it and I can't keep living this way, rotting in my bedroom, fearful or the world's judgement, how can I pursue my dreams and interest while having such an ugly face? How can express my true self that does not conform to the self others want an ugly person to have? \n\nI'm afraid to be put down because I automatically interiorize everybody's judgement, it's like I have no boundaries, the way I automatically react is by not being able to distinguish between my own feelings and those of other people. I automatically adopt other people's viewpoints because I feel inferior to them. But if I had an average face, I wouldn't feel the need to do that anymore, because I would have an unbreakable belief in my worth. \n\nSince I can't get surgery, how can I pursue what I love and express my real personality while having an ugly face? How can I stop being afraid of being judged and humiliated by other people? \n\nI'd prefer to hear answers from other very ugly people who were able to overcome this and build a great life for themselves. Thanks in advance.",

      "selftext": "During my teen years, I was crazy interested in programming. I got interested because I used to script mods for a game, it helped me create things I was dreaming of, and oh boy, it was a pleasure to write code!\n\nForward to my university years, I got into computer science because I thought writing code for the rest of my life would be as cool as it was in my teen years. For a moment, during my university years, it was! I aced my classes and was happily writing code for projects and coming up with unique little tools and ideas to build.\n\nAfter graduation, I hit a brick wall. I found out there are very few jobs for programmers in my country, and almost none in my city. I searched for months, but in the end, I settled for a tutoring role. I worked as a tutor for two years, and then, just with sheer luck, I found a paid internship, applied, and was offered the position. I think I got offered the internship because the pay was low—it was basically slave labor—but it was decent by my country’s standards. I believed that building my reputation, network, and experience working with a US-based startup was worth more than the pay.\n\nI worked as an intern for 6 months, then moved to a Jr. Role, doing full-stack work. I worked as a Jr for 8 more months, then the startup failed to secure funding. So, again, I was unemployed.\n\nI got referred to a different startup by my old employer, started working there as the only frontend developer, the pay was good, and the work was good, but that startup also failed to secure funding, and I was let go.\n\nNow, I am unemployed. I applied to hundreds, if not thousands, of openings on LinkedIn, HackerNews’ monthly “Who is Hiring” threads, but got nothing.\n\nI am now in an existential crisis, local work where I live is almost non-existent, and even if I do come across an opening, the pay is not even decent by my standards; it simply is not worth the effort. So, my goal is to find contract roles and fully remote roles abroad, and honestly, I don’t know how viable that goal is now.\n\nI am even thinking of shifting my focus away from software development due to the market saturation worldwide.\n\nWhat would you do if you were me? I’m looking for real, honest, and thoughtful feedback.",

At best, you’ll exhaust yourself; at worst, you’ll enable them.\n\n\n2. Your parents shaped your wiring, but healing it is your responsibility.\n\nIt’s not your fault what happened to you as a child, but it is on you to do the work as an adult. Blame explains, but it doesn’t repair.\n\n\n\n3. People rarely change because of insight alone.\n\nMost don’t transform because they “finally understood.” They change when the pain of staying the same outweighs the fear of changing.\n\n\n4. Repressed emotions don’t disappear - they get stored in the body.\n\nThe tears you don’t cry, the anger you swallow, the needs you deny… they don’t vanish. They leak out as tension, anxiety, illness, or explosive behavior later.\n\n\n5. People can love you and still hurt you.\n\nAttachment wounds mean someone can genuinely love you and consistently fail you. Love isn’t the same as being safe, consistent, or healthy.\n\n\n\n6. Most people would rather protect their ego than face their truth.\n\nSelf-deception is a survival mechanism. People defend the story that feels less painful, even if it’s a lie, because the truth threatens their identity.\n\n\n\n7. Avoidance is expensive.\n\nEvery uncomfortable feeling you avoid compounds interest. The longer you run, the bigger the monster grows. Facing pain hurts; avoiding it destroys.\n\n\n\n8. Not everyone will get closure - sometimes healing means giving it to yourself.\n\nYou may never get the apology, the explanation, or the “I love you” you deserved. The brutal truth is: waiting for it keeps you chained. Closure comes from you, not them.\n\n\n\n9. The brain craves familiarity, not happiness.\n\nYou’ll unconsciously recreate the same dynamics you hated as a child, because they feel “normal.” Breaking the cycle requires awareness and active choice.\n\n\n\n10. Healing feels worse before it feels better.\n\nThe moment you stop numbing, the buried stuff comes rushing out. That’s not failure, that’s the purge before the relief.\n\nJust some advice that I learned throughout my healing journey. \n\nThis morning I had a good cry & putting my feelings to paper has helped. I hope whoever reads this will benefit from it. ❤️",

      "selftext": "Hi all, I’ve been using AI on a daily basis for various reasons in both work and life. However, I recently read some interesting research papers that suggest using AI for problem-solving risks diminishing a critical skill called “metacognition”. Ever since, I’ve been super fascinated about this, and started exploring ways of using a secondary AI that is tasked to make me more aware of my own thinking while I’m thinking with my primary AI. Basically, a dual screen system.\n\nHonestly, it has been really useful so far, especially in understanding my own thought patterns.\n\nI’m curious: has anyone of you done something similar? And if so, what was your experience or your method? ",

I mess up my talk. I dont feel confident even to go out. I fear what they'd think just by looking at me. Aint got that charisma.\n\nThe way I dress :  \nI don't dress great. I blame my parents for this. I'm only 20. They don't give me enough pocket money to buy clothes not matter how much I beg.\n\nThe way I look :  \nI'm short (5'4''). A big nose. I don't have great facial features. Not satisfied with my skin either. Lean. I started going to the gym. My parents wouldn't even buy me protein.\n\nThe way I am in my field right now ( work / study ) :  \nI am in my final year. I started looking out for jobs. I'm not so great at what I have to do. So I'm not sure if I am going to find a job that pays me enough.\n\nThe lifestyle I got :  \nI imagine this lifestyle in my head. I want to have the city life. Nice friends. Good food. No parents drama. A gf / some friends who I can count on. I just don't want to be alone.\n\nThe people I hang out with :  \nThese fellas ain't bad. These are dumb. Dumb af. Shit people. I'd rather hang out with some bad people rather than these dumb ass people.\n\nMy Parents :  \nThey treat me like shit. They are toxic. Always black mailing me emotionally. They wouldn't even treat me and my brother the same way.\n\nMan, I feel like all these things are effecting my confidence.  \nI can't go out. I am afraid what people are going to judge me for. My clothes? My height? My talk? I don't know. I want to go out so badly. I want to meet nice people. Make some nice friends. Fall out of the trap I'm in right now.\n\nI don't know what this is called, I wouldn't do anything until I feel like I'm perfect at something.  \nIf I miss the flow of doing things, and I realize that in between.

I'll try sticking to the scheduling from the next day\" ( this is with everything in general. like going to the gym, doing some work, anything I plan )\n\nAm I missing out on some key aspect that I am not realizing? What could be the problem??  \nI desperate to fall out of this cage in my mind. I would do anything. It could take time. But I got to start somewhere\n\n",

      "title": "The shame you feel around your true self is slowly killing your confidence",
      "selftext": "*Better life philosophy #10*\n\nWhen we try to be someone we're not by playing a character, we supress our true selves which in turn, suppresses our confidence. A certain mist forms around our true selves in the form of the shame we feel surrounding being our true selves. \n\nThe mist surrounding our true selves makes us invisible to the people that f*ck with our true selves.\n\n**Confidence simply comes down to accepting that you don't have to be anyone but yourself. Becoming your truest, most unapologetic self.**\n\nWhat comes with accepting this is you realise that anyone can be confident, no matter who they are, what they look like, or what they're interested in. You can be a nerd with confidence, you can be an athlete with confidence, you can be a loner with confidence, you can be a trauma survivor with confidence.\n\nIdentifying and questioning the belief systems that form the basis of our shame is the first step to eliminating this shame. From there we can adopt more realistic and healthy belief systems in which to form the basis of how we view ourselves.\n\nThis is important to know as we are always projecting how we feel out into the world. Better then to learn to project acceptance of oneself as opposed to shame.\n\nFrom my experience in doing this, the root cause of our unhealthy beliefs systems tend to have been formed during our formative years. This makes sense since during this period, we heavily relied upon our surrounding environment (parents, family and school in particular) to assist in forming our worldview. Because of this, any unresolved trauma and shame stemming from our environment would have surely been passed onto us. Whether we are conscious or not of doing this, we are always projecting our worldview out onto the world as we interact with it.\n\nNow this is not to say that everything we were taught in our formative years were bad for us. Think of this process like doing a deep clean of yourself. Discarding the unhealthy beliefs and reinforcing the healthy ones.\n\nSince 'Competence is a great creator of confidence' (as Mary Jo Putney put it) addressing our shame in order to accept—and have a clearer sense of—who we are will help us work towards becoming competent in being ourselves (aka building self esteem). Another crucial aspect to becoming confident.\n\nNow with all that being said, adopting new, healthy, and realistic beliefs systems will not be an easy—or overnight—process. In fact, it's the opposite. This is because in doing so, you will be confronting and killing off a bunch of previously held beliefs, perspectives and attitudes you may have been holding onto for most, if not all, of your life. But in doing so, remember that you are simply killing off the old you in favour of a new and improved version of yourself.\n\n'Once you are real, you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand' - Margery Williams in The Velveteen Rabbit",

We talked everyday, saw each other a couple of times a week (still fooling around), went on a date, spent the night together. I honestly thought we were getting back together. Then she goes 2-3 days without texting me (well texting but not giving attention) comes back, and tells me she can’t see me anymore because she’s talking to another guy. Not gonna lie it felt like I got stabbed in the gut. Every right because we had “split up” but it still sucked. I held onto that pain far too long until I went seeking help. Ive been seeing a therapist for a couple of months now and yeah im a piece of work lol.\n\n\nOnto the meat, so far I’ve realized that I had zero self compassion and fed the pain body way too much. I’m learning about these things but with Neff the cheating story she keeps bringing up breaks the book for me and with Tolle it’s a bit too spiritual, I can’t follow too well.\n\nMy question is what other books are out there that address the pain body and self compassion but from a more tangible angle? Tolle is too spiritual and Neff’s personal story throws me off.",

      "selftext": "I'm posting this in hopes that someone who understands my situation can offer real advice.\n\nFor context, I was born and raised in a metropolitan city in South India. As a kid, I was cheerful, spontaneous, fun, caring, and had many genuine friends (both male and female). Like any child, I had flaws,I could be fearful, naughty, mischievous, and lazy at times, but overall, my childhood was good.\n\nThings changed in my teens, especially in 9th and 10th grade. Puberty made me self-conscious, fading my happy-go-lucky attitude. I got bullied and isolated in class. At home, there was constant pressure to crack JEE in a dysfunctional family. I lost self-respect and self-esteem, realizing my school friends just tolerated me, not cared.\n\nIn 11th and 12th, I noticed even close people didn't respect me, reflecting my own lack of self-respect. I immersed myself in JEE prep to tune out the noise. In 12th, I was wrongly accused in a sensitive issue involving a woman (I don't want to discuss details). Despite being a top candidate, I failed JEE mains miserably. My sister, father, and mother were furious; I got harsh scoldings and seriously considered suicide for being an utter failure. But I remembered my mother's 9-month suffering and my father's 13-15 hour workdays for my education, so I stopped. I apologized and vowed to turn things around in B.Tech for a high-paying job.\n\nIn B.Tech, perceptions didn't change. I had a small group where I was the glue keeping it together, but once they bonded, they kept me out of pity,I was always with them but felt alone. I didn't land a good job as expected,i landed decent job. Now at 23, nothing's improved.\n\nMy main issue: How do I change my attitude, behavior, and mindset so people at least see me, respect me, and view me as a real friend?\n\nMy pros:\n- Caring\n- Good friend\n- Honest\n- Cool (I think)\n- Genuinely look after people in my life\n- Family first\n- Smart\n- Hardworking\n- Sometimes mature\n\nMy cons:\n- Porn addict\n- Overthinker\n- Hate myself\n- No self-like or respect\n- Very very pessimistic mindset\n- Sometimes envious of others' success\n- Feel unloved\n- Don't know how to communicate(but I am extrovert and when I am with them they seem to enjoy my talks, my jokes)\n- Sometimes immature\n- Sometimes inconsiderate without realizing\n\nI'm not seeking external validation,I don't care if people dislike my hobbies. I think I'm a normal guy aside from a few issues, but once people get to know me, they avoid me, don't respect me, or care. If asked, they'd say I'm \"cool\" or \"normal,\" but I end up ignored and isolated.\n\nIs it something that picked up when I was kid? Didn't i hit my puberoty correctly?\nAm I not mature enought to behave as adults?\nIs somepart of my brain is yet to develop?\n\nI know it's not something seriously wrong(of maybe it is)with me, but I can't pinpoint what I'm unknowingly exuding that makes people hate or avoid me. Is it some tiny detail I'm doing without knowing?\n\nI'm open to any suggestions: YouTube videos to watch, books to read, routines or detoxes to follow, or even consulting a psychiatrist,I'll do it. Just give me advice on where to start.\n\n",

But knowing stuff like bills and taxes and such i dont know but i want to learn how i want to but i feel like when i ask mom and dad or who ever at this point get mad dont tell me but when i try to do it they will go \"son you idot you can do that your a dumbass as always your such a idot\" NO IM NOT I JUST NEED HELP I...i don't know man i just want to do good but i feel like i cant do it and I'll fuck it up. All i want to do is try and look and see i can grt out of that environment and get a breather from my family since i feel they are toxic or what ever. Stuff like this makes me get stressed out then i go lay down to calm down from thinking on what to do but nothing got dang it man, fuvk.",

I’m losing my innocence on the way I’ve viewed people and love and connection. Particularly in romantic relationships partners have preyed on me, even try to break me down. In the moment I had no idea that’s what they were trying to do, never in my mind I would think people do this to others just because but I’m having so much delayed grief reflecting on the people that were trying to cause me pain. I have always been outspoken, I speak up about things I do not like, I try my hardest to be honest. It was a huge trigger in me realizing when it’s time to break up, people would rather lie about why even though I tell them I can handle the truth. This was pattern in my life and recently broke me apart when a lover I thought the world of, felt so confident in, betrayed me, smeared my character and turned out to be someone they were not. Im sure I missed red flags, I take responsibility for that. When I see people’s lightness and darkness, I accept them maybe because that’s what I’d do if it was the other way around. But they end up hating that and punishing me for it? My vulnerability and kindness has been seen as naivety , and that’s heart breaking because I believe sharing kindness is such a strength. I see vulnerability as someone trusting my character, not a means to exploit someone. When I realize they see this as a weakness, I cut them off and go silent and distant and then they’re shocked that I protected myself. I realize that I have been a very, “give the benefit of the doubt person”.. I just cannot understand this malicious intent and behavior for the life of me, being jealous of friends and partners, using people for gratification and voids, ghosting etc. I’ve caused myself a lot of pain  and I take 100% responsibility for myself and the way I’ve navigated this life. I want to be more tact. If you were like me , what did you do ? What did you change? What did you discover about yourself and others? \n\n\nEdit: gave more context on my feelings and stance ",

      "selftext": "Hi, I wanted to share a list of what people focus on when it comes to *self-improvement* and *discipline*. They may do different things, but usually for the same purpose (well-being, performance, etc.).\n\nI’m sharing this because I feel like most communities are *overspecialized* and tend to focus only on one aspect of life.\n\nLet’s get started. I’ll try to order this list roughly the way Maslow might have, from what seems most essential to what might be less essential (but still important).\n\n* **Food and drink**: less junk food, less sugar, fewer products shipped from the other side of the world, less of anything considered unhealthy or unethical.\n* **Breathing and mindfulness**: for relaxation, focus, health, etc.\n* **Temperature**: from Wim Hof–style cold exposure to simply not overheating everything, as many Westerners tend to do.\n* **Sleep**: anything that really helps someone get truly refreshing rest.\n* **Sexuality**: NoFap communities, avoiding pornography, etc.\n* **Addictions**: of all kinds — from hard drugs to coffee, to non-chemical addictions like gaming, social media, and so on.\n* **Letting go and kindness**: practices that help you feel comfortable in less-than-ideal situations, and that make you more of a giving rather than a taking person.\n* **Anything personally meaningful**: for example, as a beekeeper, I used to work on my hives without gloves. It forced me to be truly careful about what I was doing, instead of rushing and messing things up just because I was protected.\n\nIt’s actually quite hard to make such a list, since some of these things overlap — especially the *breathing/mindfulness* part.\n\nI’d really appreciate it if some of you could help me complete or refine this modest list, or simply add your own thoughts.\n\nOne last thought: since most communities are overspecialized, I wonder if the things they focus on sometimes come at the expense of something else nobody is paying attention to. Put simply, imagine someone addicted to cigarettes who quits smoking — but then doubles their coffee intake, or starts eating more junk food instead.",

One area I really want to focus on is using natural remedies instead of reaching for pills for every small issue like stress, fatigue, or digestion. I recently came across a book called Holistic Herbal Guide Book to Health and Wellness by Linda Lucilla Giordano\nIt seems to combine herbs with overall self-care routines. For those of you who have explored herbal wellness what helped you the most in the beginning? Was it books, daily routines, or just learning by experience?",

I’ve gone to therapy even though my ex didn’t believe in it. I believe I’ve outgrown these relationships but I’ve seen people being patient with their partner during periods of misalignment. I’m not sure if I’m just picking the wrong people or I’m just really impatient. Towards the end, the relationship would stagnate, codependent tendencies appear, people get complacent and then we’d feel trapped.\n\nSince my breakup, I started to live life intentionally. I now have an active lifestyle, a healthy social life, and a well-maintained home. I’m scared to lose these in a relationship. I always lose myself in relationships. That’s what happened to my ex, too. \n\nI also know coupled friends who maintains other close relationships while partnered which is okay but I sometimes don’t see the point of being partnered. Some of them would have a bestfriend of the opposite sex who they also call their soulmate. Another one hides meeting with off-limits people. There are also others who are in open relationships. There’s one who would flirt in front of his fiancée. They would be posting about how much they love each other but close interactions with them makes me see through them. I know there are pros and cons in a relationship but I can’t see the good outweighing the bad. \n\nI honestly want to love another person again but love doesn’t require a social contract. I guess I’m looking for hopeful and inspiring stories of those who met their match. ",

I searched my therapist background and all those details, and she seems fit to help me overcome the unbearable pain I have, and help me dig deeper into my childhood etc. \n\nAfter 6 sessions, I feel like nothing is changing, at the beginning of each session, she would ask me “Okay Moon, how are you and what do you want to talk about today” , and I find myself rambling an talking and talking , with no feedback, when she replies, it’s to “summarize” what I said, my ChatGPT is more insightful!! \n\nEverytime I wanted to talk about him, question why and how, she would tell me “Sorry to stop you here but you should not focus on him”! \nBut?! I am where I am because of him? Don’t you want to know what I’ve been through? \n\nIs this normal? Should I be more patient? Is she collecting more data to be able to help me in the future? This is my first time going to therapy!

Not tonight.\n\nMy mind is racing, firing a mile a minute, full of what-ifs, could-be’s and would-have-been’s. The mental trap that makes procrastination seem like the ideal solution. The uncertainty chipping away at me with every tick of the clock.\n\nWhat if my dreams come true, what if they don’t? Could I be the person I want to become? If I could be, wouldn’t I be already? Why am I so damn lazy? How can I fix myself?\n\nAll these thoughts swirl in my head like a tornado spinning out of control, negative thoughts pelting me like hail. I don’t feel like I’m good enough to ever change. What if I stay lost and all this is for nothing?\n\nI know I’m not the only one who has those thoughts. I know you do too.\n\nBut really, how could it all be for nothing? There’s no such thing as staying the same. You are either moving forward or moving backward, getting better or falling behind. If you are doing the actions that move you forward, you will go forward.\n\nThat is the truth I have to remind myself of in these hours when my doubts feel the loudest. Growth is not a clean line. It is not a sudden transformation where one day you wake up and everything you have ever wanted has arrived. It is a long climb made of small, unglamorous decisions. Most of them feel invisible until one day you look back and realize how far you have come.\n\nAt 3am it is easy to believe you are broken. It is harder to accept that you are just in a process. The in-between phase feels like quicksand because you cannot see the results yet. But every action you take, even if it is just finishing an assignment, going for a walk, or cooking yourself a real meal, is a vote for the person you are becoming.\n\nIf you are awake right now, wrestling with the same thoughts, know this. Doubt does not mean you are doomed. Doubt means you are on the edge of change. It is a sign you are confronting the gap between who you are and who you want to be. Most people never even get that far.\n\nSo take a breath. Choose one small thing today that moves you forward. Not a perfect plan, not a total reinvention, just a step. A step is enough, because steps compound. They always do.\n\nOne day you will look back at nights like this and realize they were part of your turning point, not evidence of your failure.\n\nKeep moving. Even if it is slow. Especially when it is slow.",

      "selftext": "Advice 1: **Become a doer:**  \n\n No matter what you do in life, even if you absolutely love what you do, there are going to be times when you absolutely are not in the mood and feel incredibly lazy to do stuff that must be done. The only way to become a doer is to cultivate the habit of doing things even when you do not feel like them and in the long term making them sustainable by practicing this habit. You can start small and do this for smaller and much easier to follow tasks like making your bed or taking deep breaths for a few seconds when you are in a dysregulated mood. \n\n\n\nAdvice 2: **Take 100 percent of responsibility for yourself:**\n\n It is so easy to blame and complain and to free yourself of the emotional and the cognitive burden of taking responsibility for things that happen to you. You are having a bad day because you caught a cold? That makes you feel like shit? Now, it is so easy to say that oh it is the cold that caused your bad mood, however to take responsibility for the cold and to say that despite the cold I am going to try and be in a decent mood and self regulate my emotions, that would take a hell lot of courage but in the process you would also learn to take responsibility for the things that happen to you. Do not take this in a toxic way and blame yourself, but learn to deal with things that suck and still come out of them with a healthy self regulated emotional state, while taking the responsibility for it.    \n\n",

It’s exceptionally unsatisfying.\n\nI say this now because last week I caught a cold, and it threw me off of my rhythm. It culminated in me skipping class on Thursday, when, despite being fully healed, I slept for about 15 hours through both my am and pm classes. I hate doing that and even though I probably don’t need to go, it’s not the kind of person that I want to be.\n\nOn Thursday night, I work my ass off to recover, to drink water walk eat etc, plan the next day so I can try and rebound, but despite being fine illness-wise, I only got about two hours of actual solid work done, and spent the rest of the time watching tv, scrolling, and procrastinating. It’s like this lingering thing that’s still there\n\nI don’t feel as though I have depression, in an ordinary sense. I certainly act depressed (lethargy, lack of motivation, lack of interest), but I have a positive outlook on life and the world, goals, hopes and dreams.\n\nI’m trying really hard to build a baseline habit of routine right now and it’s feeling very uphill. There is nothing I do at the same time/relative time in my day everyday, and that’s the only strategy I’ve heard of to be able to start to try and take control over my life.\n\nLong story short, I’m just sick and tired of knowing exactly what to do to become who I want to be and how to do it, and missing the final crucial step of just literally acting, doing something, doing anything.\n\nHas anyone else dealt with anything like this before?

Just to clarify now… **EVERYTIME I HAVE GOTTEN BACK ON THIS SITE IT SUCKS.**\n\nAround when I made this account 10 years ago this site was very different. I was active on many subs, and was very popular on a few for video-games. I loved the site and used it as a downtime when I was not with friends or family, or doing school work.\n\nSomething changed around 2016-17. I began to notice a shift in the site. It slowly got worse.\n\nI one time made a post and got. “Your name is Camogamer123, way to tell on yourself.” My post had nothing controversial or political in it.\n\nI would post on relationship boards about the mistakes an ex and I made. I would get told that “everything is your fault you POS.”\n\nMore recently when making a post I get “well looking at your history you are an alcoholic drug doing Catholic.” Etc… etc…\n\nI also moderated one of the largest subs on my alt… The comments and threats I got were incredible.\n\n**Recently I cleared my entire profile and periodically delete everything. This site is filled with terminally online freaks who fancy themselves activist against normal people.**\n\n**The greatest way to improve yourself is to get offline and strengthen your bonds IRL.** I have never felt better than the times I was far away from Reddit/Discord/Social Media.\n\nI feel strong. I have forgiven myself. I have many irl friends. I work out. I have a stable job. I have money to do things I love.\n\n**All of this online activity breeds extremism.

But lately everytime I go out I’m bogged down by my desire to be liked to the point where it drives me crazy and I’ll convince myself that everyone hates me becuase im reading into everything so deeply even though I know it isn’t true. It’s like I need constant proof of that I am indeed likeable. \n\nI also feel like I need to have my attractiveness constantly validated because I’ve never experienced romance or mutual attraction that went anywhere no matter how hard I try. Whenever I go partying with friends I’m stuck watching them get hit on and asked to dance everytime and it makes me feel like shit. My jealousy makes me think toxic thoughts and then I feel so guilty for thinking that way. My friends try to assure me that I am attractive, but if no one ever flirts with me or shows interest in me than how am I supposed to believe that? I get so triggered when I see it happening to others that I just go home and cry. I think about it everyday. I feel like I can never relax in social settings because I’m stuck in my head thinking about how I’m being perceived, even through outwardly I’m acting perfectly normal. I just want to be free and confident again, but it’s like I’m stuck in hole I can’t get out of. ",

      "selftext": "So this could be a therapy topic to discuss one day with an actual therapist, but it’s not that consuming of my life to where I’m concerned about it (hopefully). However, I need to just express my frustrations, in hopes that I’ll find healing even in the slightest fashion.\n\nI don’t hate men, no. I love people. I am open with anyone I meet and try to see the good in people wherever I go. But there will be times where I become sickenly fearful and disgusted by some men that makes me hyper critical of all of them. I’m constantly afraid of abuse, grape, and violence whenever I’m around them. Sometimes it eats away at me. Growing up I’ve learned to just keep my mouth shut.\n\nTo clarify, there are women I loathe as well. I believe that every human being has flaws. But whenever I think of the men who I was raised with, or the few bad instances I meet, I’m met with a deep seething anger in my whole being. I’m not an angry person. But as I get older I start to notice it’s getting into my relationships with men in particular because I can’t physically stand being close to them or emotionally vulnerable with them ever. I’ve grown to know most of them to be manipulators and liars. (Which I understand is the equivalent of men saying all women are sl*ts and harlots) I know there are good men out there. For me it’s just… a deep bias of hatred and anger I can’t overcome.\n\nEver since I got my new job though, I’ve been forced to work with all men, but in na environment that protects me and creates a safe space for us all. There’s probably one or two men I’d feel safe around. (Which is new for me) But besides that, I’m crippled with fear. If a man even touches me I freeze and jolt, even if I trust them.\n\nThe more I write the more I think therapy is the best thing lol. But I don’t have the money so I’m just yapping on Reddit. Men, I’m sorry. I love you guys, I’m hoping to just heal and change how I see the world. Open to suggestions 👋",

      "selftext": "I would like to start by saying this post is not meant to support the victim mentality or a sour attitude towards the world. \n\n  \nSo studying about brain neurochemistry and addiction sciences I realised something. The world never even made an effort to help us. Yes they studied how addictions work but let me show you how these studies were actually used:\n\n  \n1) 1950s, study of Dopamine Pathways ----> Unpredictable rewards = More compulsive addictive behaviour. How it was used? To help human kind get rid of addictions forever. SIKE!! Jk, it was actually used by the gambling industry in Casino Slot Machines. This study is also the base for almost all social media apps. The study was called Variable Ratio Reinforcement if you wanna check it out yourself. \n\n  \n2) A 2017 paper linked lootboxes to gambling addiction, what it did was a reinforced feature that EA, Activision and other big gaming companies use till date.\n\n  \n3) Fast Food industries used the neuroscience studies to find the perfect sugar/fat/ salt ratio to make there food irresistable. Source: 2013 book Sugar Salt Fat\n\n  \nDon't you think if the world really wanted to they could have rid us of these things that is literally claiming millions of lives. Other advancements humankind has made have always been a huge leap across short period of time. \n\nFor example:\n\n1) Sputnik was launched in 1957 (world's first satallite to go into space), 12 years later man steps on moon.\n\n  \n2) First model of the DNA emerged in 1953, in 2012 we figured out how to even edit genes.\n\n  \n3) 1970, revolution of computers and well who doesnt have a little computer in their pocket nowadays.\n\n  \nSo you get my point right? Although methods like CBT, AVRT and MBRP exist to help people they are not funded. While addiction sciences are backed by billion dollar corporations. The methods that actually fix people are bad business models, they do not make money because the customer has no need to return.\n\nPrograms like 12 step AA meetings are good business models, scientists know they do not work but they bring recurring clients. \n\n  \nBut hey, historically the rich and powerful have always tried to suppress the mass. Think French Revolution. I do not want you guys to lose hope and I am actively working on solving this. So far my findings have gotten me and people I share it with, extraordinary results. You can find them in my previous post. It is a mix of AVRT, Allen Carr's Easy Way and almost every addiction science that really works for people. \n\nI am slowly realising the fact that even though hooking us is a billion dollar industry, the system is still rigged for us to win. I have explained this in my other post. Thanks for reading, all the best guys",

      "selftext": "I don't know when I started feeling so ashamed about myself. I can't go anywhere without feeling completely insignificant and worthless. And it's like, just a mix of things, for instance:\n\nI feel bad that I can't afford anything anywhere. My GF and I both work 2 jobs and are both still paycheck to paycheck. I hate being anywhere and being reminded constantly that I'll never be able to afford practically anything besides basics. And it's not like the I want anything luxurious, but man it just feels bad knowing that I'll never be able to \"indulge\" in a hobby or comfortably buy someone a gift, or buy anything on a whim \"just because\". It's stupid because I am not really a materialistic person but, like... It'd be cool to be able to afford a Lego set or something occasionally.\n\nI get so easily frustrated by other people, and I don't want to be. It's like I get jealous of just about everyone I see. Everyone seems so happy and fulfilled. People out with their friends and family, people expressing themselves through creative outfits and accessories... I always find myself wondering why I can't feel the same way. I don't know why I can't just let go and feel happiness and not care about others.\n\nSimilarly, I get so envious when I go in social media and see people I grew up with all leading happy, successful lives. Some of them are so cool and authentic. Hell specifically my ex GF causes me the most grief. Her and I broke on good terms and still keep in contact today, but it's crazy when I think about how \"on the same level\" we were in college and now she's a wildly successful calligraphy artist hosting these huge classes all over the state. It's just crazy to me how far our paths diverged. \n\nI feel inauthentic. I don't know when this happened. When I was younger I felt like I understood myself better, aren't you supposed to get yourself more as you grow up? I feel so lost and confused in life, I have no idea who I am or where I'm going. Especially career wise. I do have 2 jobs but they are both completely dead end. Ones a casino cashier, the others a dog daycare attendant. I have a completely useless \"media\" degree but do nothing with it. And on that note:\n\nI feel like just completely wasted potential. I don't think of myself as dumb or lazy. Infact I'm really proud of my critical thinking skills and work ethic. I like getting tasks done. I like solving problems. I'm constantly the \"de facto\" support person at any job I've had. Always the one people go to with IT issues, opions, problems, etc. and I am seen as reliable by my bosses. And yet, I feel like I'm just completely wasting any potential I have because idk I deep down doubt myself or something? I have no career path at all...\n\nI feel like I should also say that despite all of that, I'm wouldn't say I'm unhappy with my life. In fact I'm often very happy with things when I'm relaxing at home and not comparing myself to others or stressing about money. I love my GF more than anything, it's the best relationship I've ever had. I've never felt so comfortable with someone, she obviously doesn't agree with any of this about me. I'm happy with my house. I'm happy with my garden. I'm happy with my dogs and my cats. I'm happy with my house plants. I love cooking, playing games, solving puzzles, drinking beer. All these things make me very happy in any one moment, but at the end of the day it kind of all just evaporates and I'm left feeling like I'm just missing out on some bigger picture.\n\nI don't know, I think I'm just ranting now. I don't even know the point of this post. I'm so frustrated with everything. It feels like there's no hope. No light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nThank you for reading I guess. ",

Maybe that is something you want and not need.

Sometimes I don’t even think of myself as a real person. Back in my heavy teenage years, I thought this was just a phase that would fade away, but it never did , it only got worse. When someone compliments me, I can’t help but automatically say no, and after a while people get frustrated. My self-respect feels completely gone. I’m so tired of ruining my life like this. What can I do? I also feel like my pessimism has completely spiraled out of control. I can’t seem to look at things from a positive angle anymore, I’ve lost respect for myself, and I keep giving others more value than they deserve while burying myself deeper and deeper. I’m so tired of being used like this, I truly need any kind of advice.",

I realize I do that thing and start justifying why it happens. They are like I wasn’t thinking of you at all. \n- People talk about people being overweight. Start feeling insecure and very self conscious and anxious thinking they are lumping me in that group. \n- If someone doesn’t text back I’ll think they are purposely ignoring me and distance myself. \n- if people are quiet around me, I assume it’s because I did something or are boring them. \n\nI could go on. These are just a few examples from the past week. \n\nYes I know I am insecure. My therapist said I have CPTSD from my upbringing which makes me hypervigilant of my surroundings. I KNOW this but knowing isn’t helping me get better. \n\nTried justifying it as this quality making me self aware and conscientious of others.

Extended family isn't really in the picture for my wife or myself, so it's really just the two of us. My wife is disabled and I am the breadwinner. \n\nIf you do some quick math, you know that I became a Dad young. All of my adult life has been about taking care of others. Food on the table, gas in the car, school supplies, insurance, doctors visits...you get the picture. The result of this pressure was that I became money focused. Five kids takes up a lot of capital so I had to hustle my way to the top if whatever mountain I could climb. Up, up, up! And I was successful, honestly. I have a solid job, good income, reasonable insurance. I have a roof over my head, food on the table, and gas in the car. I won't say that I was able to do it all and that there aren't hard times. For example, there's nothing for retirement put back. 5 kids requires every single dime you can get. There's very little in savings. But, that's not what I need help with. \n\nNow that the kids are grown and gone, the pressure is off, and it's just me and the wife...I really don't like me very much. I don't like my job. I don't like what I do. I don't like the constant anxiety I feel around keeping my job (especially with the layoffs lately). I don't feel like I have any purpose or place. I just feel a massive amount of resentment when I look in the mirror, and I don't know how to fix that. \n\nThe weird thing is that when I do things with my wife - play a video game, catch a movie, or listen to an audiobook - I feel okay. But the second I'm alone with myself, in my own head, things start to go downhill fast. I can't focus on a hobby. I can't think of any way out of my career. I have no idea what the hell I do from here. And if I do start to make progress on something, my anxiety goes through the damn roof and I quit. I feel shame for doing the hobby in the first place. I feel silly for attempting anything, really. \n\nI guess I'd like to get some advice from anyone who may have been in a similar spot and found their way back to themselves. Or the way to a new you.

      "selftext": "I used to have very high expectations for myself and for life. Almost everything I did needed to meet some internal “good enough” standard. Dating had to lead somewhere. A job interview had to turn into an offer. Even hobbies had to look impressive.\n\nAll that did was create anxiety and disappointment. Even when things did work out, I often missed the moment because I was so attached to outcomes.\n\nAfter a painful relationship ended, I told myself I would try a different approach: curiosity instead of expectation.\n\nNow, when I date, it’s not about “is he husband material?” anymore. I just ask myself: “am I curious to know this person better?” Sometimes that means one date, sometimes a short fling, sometimes more — but I no longer leave drained or disappointed. In fact, I often leave energized, like I’ve learned something about myself or life.\n\nThe same applies in other areas:\n\n– A job interview isn’t “I must get this role” but “let’s learn about the company and see where this goes.”\n\n– Painting isn’t “I must make something beautiful” but “let’s see where the colors take me.”\n\n– A workout isn’t “I must crush this challenge” but “let’s see how my body feels today.”\n\n\nThis shift has made my life lighter and more fun. I’m more present. I notice reality as it is, instead of filtering it through expectations. The world feels bigger, and I actually enjoy the journey instead of only chasing the destination.\n\nHas anyone else tried flipping expectations into curiosity? If so, what did you notice?\n\nTL;DR: I stopped attaching myself to outcomes (dating, jobs, hobbies) and started approaching them with curiosity. It lowered my anxiety, made me more present, and helped me enjoy the process instead of obsessing over results.",

      "selftext": "Technique #1: set a timer either as a countdown to start a task or designate an amount of time to do the task and start as soon as you start the timer\n\nIssues: ideally I need to do most things for at least an hour to get them done well. Starting small (e.g. the 2 minute rule) to trick myself to get the motivation also doesn't work all the time. I can just also avoid starting the timer because I know I'll follow through after I start it.\n\nTechnique #2: Accountability buddies: having someone you report what you'll do for the day to and following up on if you did the tasks or not. Ideally having some sort of pressure from the other person placed on you\n\nIssues: Both me and the other person can become too lenient with each other from fear of discomfort and confrontation. It's easy to come up with acceptable excuses. You also sort of become numb to pushback if they do give you some. For me it's in the form of self-deprecation and agreeing with their criticisms in a sort of defeating way. \n\nAlso, punishment is not always a great motivator as a whole and can drive me to avoid even more and fall into ruts. I had a day where I was considering just unfriending and blocking my buddy since it's a purely online connection. Perhaps having an IRL accountability buddy would help this situation since I can't avoid them. But that's hard to find someone who isn't lenient with you.\n\nTechnique #3: The one I've had the least but a bit of success with: starting small (kind of similar to part of #1) You trick yourself into being motivated to complete something by doing a super little amount.\n\nIssues: It's always going to be hard to actually do something well. 2 minutes of your essay is not going to be enough time by when it's due for example. In order for me to learn more art fundamentals, I have to do tons of drills for hours every day to actually get somewhere. To finish an animation takes hours. And it's all hard work. This method is the most confusing to me on how people say it works.\n\nAnother thing is that people will say with this method that you'll realize things are easier than you thought. No, they aren't. They still suck.\n\nAnd for me, my habits always remain small, because increasing the time means increasing a hell of a lot more pain.\n\n---\n\nSo how can I structure these techniques to actually stop myself from procrastinating most of the time? I have neglected so much of my potential and it makes me miserable. I don't know what to do.\n\nI don't think I have ADHD, but I was diagnosed with autism, and ADHD strategies seem to work well for me, I just haven't looked into them enough. Any recommendations for resources/books to read on it? \n\nThank you.",

      "selftext": "So I was looking back at some old journal entries and realized something about my procrastination. Back then it wasnt really that I was lazy, it was more that I was avoiding discomfort. I wasnt putting off the task itself, I was putting off the feeling that came with it.\n\nThese days I dont really struggle with procrastination anymore. A lot of that is because Ive built this mindset where I dont care too much about how I feel in the moment, I just do what needs to be done. But when I read those entries I could see some interesting patterns in why I procrastinated so much, so I figured Id write them down here.\n\nProcrastinating on boring tasks: your brain doesnt measure things by how fun they are, its always relative. If I spent 3 hours gaming, of course doing homework or work after that felt boring. That thought of this is boring was uncomfortable, so I avoided it. But if I spent those 3 hours reading, journaling, walking, training… suddenly the same task didnt feel boring at all. Thats when I started doing what I call dopamine recalibration. Basically cutting out hyperstimulating stuff so that the normal boring things actually felt rewarding again.\n\nAnd yeah, I still want to enjoy myself, so I do what I call dopamine loading. First part of the day is all focus, work, projects, gym, eating clean single ingredient foods. Then at night, once everything is done, I let myself enjoy a movie, some yt, maybe a game. But in moderation.\n\nProcrastinating on unclear tasks: this was huge for me. When I didnt know where to start, I would just keep putting it off. What helped big time was sitting with a blank piece of paper and just writing whatever came to mind about the thing I needed to do. No plan, no structure, just words. And somehow it always started to unfold itself once I did that.\n\nProcrastinating because it felt too hard: yeah, sometimes the task is actually just heavy. Thats uncomfortable and my instinct was to avoid it. But honestly, thats the exact reason it mattered. I saw this a lot with the gym. Its not that I didnt like training, but when I was tired it felt impossible to get started. Still, the progress only came when I did it anyway. Same thing with studying or building something new. The too hard stuff is where the growth is.\n\nAnd then addictions. This was the worst one. Because sometimes I wasnt even consciously procrastinating, I would just grab my phone, start scrolling, and suddenly 30 minutes were gone. Addictions hijack your time and focus, and they make everything else seem boring in comparison. I honestly believe you cant really escape procrastination until you deal with the addictions too. If you struggle with that, I write a lot about addiction recovery on my profile, you can check it out.",

Lately, I’ve realized how much this limits me and takes away the people I care about. No one wants to be with a desperate, crying girl who always thinks negatively and overanalyzes everything. This has been the killer of all my relationships.\n\nMy ex broke up with me in August because of this. Afterward, we started talking again, but yesterday we had a small argument about me being the same as before… and it really hurts me. I don’t know how to get out of this mindset and be more positive. I’ve decided to start playing affirmations for myself during the day or repeating them in my head to help shift my thinking.\n\nTo give you an example of my life:\nWe’ll call the guy who broke up with me “Piano.” Piano texts me, checks in on me, calls me, but my obsessive self wants him to do it all the time. I go to bed and immediately imagine all the worst-case scenarios, which have actually “manifested” a few times. Then I start crying, feeling pain where there isn’t any, and looking for problems where no problems actually exist.\n\nI don’t know how to get out of this. Has anyone experienced something similar? How did you deal with it? I’d really appreciate any advice or support.",

      "selftext": "I am just trying to see if anybody feels the same or at least somewhat similar to my situation. I am almost 30, have been using Instagram pretty much since it first became a thing when I was a teenager. For the past couple of years, I had an “on and off” relationship with it, taking a break for couple of weeks before coming back to see what my “friends” were up to. It’s September 25th today and I haven’t logged in since January 1st. The more time I spend away the more I hesitate ever coming back, even if sometimes I feel like I should go for work (to see what things are trending, so that we can use it at work when promoting our stuff on Instagram, for Gen Z). There are so many things I hate about it, such as:\n\n- obviously the fakeness, the constant, subconscious comparison we make with other people\n- the constant influx of information our brain hasn’t evolved to yet (just remember how our parents used to receive news - once a day, when they watched the TV for 30 min after dinner)\n- the incredible overconsumption of everything! The home related stuff, clothes, makeup etc. I hate it for my finances and for the planet.\n- how everybody and everything has to be perfect from their teeth to their homes, everything has to be brand new and shiny, including the relationships\n- how the reels literally shorten our attention span (and other neurological issues Instagram and tiktok cause)\n- how everybody shares everything (honestly I don’t care about what an acquaintance of mine had for lunch)\n- how people do (stupid) shit for attention \n\nI realised how many things changed since I quit Instagram. Such as… I don’t really ever take a random selfie before going out, I don’t take a picture of food when I meet with a friend for a lunch. I’m just right there, right then, present. \n \nObviously I haven’t quit social media in general as I’m still writing this post on Reddit. And don’t get me wrong, Reddit isn’t perfect either but I feel like it’s real, it’s raw, people are mostly supportive and it’s just better for the brain in general. My timeline is mostly filled with daily problems of normal people not pretending to be perfect, cool videos and pictures of cats and dogs. \n\nDoes anyone feel the same? Realising how many things you hate about it with more and more time passing and “dreading” the possibility of ever coming back? ",

So yeah, I really want to start journaling.\nBUT! ☝🏼 here’s the thing that bothers me. It doesn’t feel right somehow.\nTo me, it feels weird, pointless and cringe whenever I try to do that. I find it really hard to write down what I think about, even though I think it’s the most efficient way to cope with everyday life, and digital writing feels even less personal. What would you suggest? Try anyways until It doesn’t feel weird anymore? Or is there a third option I’m not considering?\n\nThank you!",

      "selftext": "tldr- my mom had serious health things going on recently, and my brother and I didn't check on her enough, and she's extremely upset. I want to do the right thing but I don't really know what that is, talking about feelings hasn't been any of our strong suits\n\nedit- what else can I say to make up for it? I apologized, and afterwards we all said we love you to each other, and she asked if I still wanted to go to a concert afterwards with her next month. So I guess I'm just looking for what to say to her next when I call her and tell her how I'm feeling\n\nMy mom recently had a major surgery and has a few health conditions that really freaked her out, and my brother and I are away at school so we weren't able to be there for her to help her out. We texted her a couple times shortly after the surgery and checked in on her, but we didn't ask her again afterwards. We mistook her short answers as trying to keep to herself, and she's extremely upset because we didn't reach out to her sooner to check in on her\n\nI feel awful, but I don't know how to make up for it. My brother seems to sort of be on the same page but isn't worrying as much as I am about it. We tried to text her back and forth a little bit last night, but since she's upset we just tried to be understanding only and not make things worse than we already have. We both asked our boyfriends though to get outside opinions on what to do, but I'm confused because both are saying the opposite things. Our family has never been really communicative about emotions until they're *really* a problem, and he and I never really told her about ours much\n\nBut my brother's bf and therapist said to basically just be civilized and sympathetic enough to calm her down, but told us we should schedule a day we can meet her in person to talk this over (and we picked a day but it's not until next month), but focused on not letting her use power and control (this has been something that's come up in therapy/from the past)\n\nMy bf said to do the opposite, and said to call her today and explain all my feelings to her now that I was crying my eyes out over, and let her decide if she accepts it or not, focusing on that this has to happen at some point, and we should do something to show the urgency of the feelings, since it's our responsibility to start that process if we want things to change for the better\n\nI'm just not really sure which approach is better, and I can't stop worrying because I know how destructive of a decision this was and it won't get any better, but I just want to give up my childish habits and do the right thing for once instead of hiding from it",

      "selftext": "Ok so for last several months I admitted after a few posts that I had an unhealthy mindset. I was depressed about not being able to get into a relationship where I was \"ugly and no women would want me\" type of attitude. \n\nAfter being sick and tired of feeling like this i decided to take a change and ive noticed somethings. \n\nFirst things first I put up the phone and hour usually around there before bed. Before I would usually just doomscroll and find myself being lonely and depressed in that moment comparing myself to everyone else. \n\nThen Ive started trying to be more confident by telling myself that I'm fine just as I am myself. It started showing signs of working as I now feel rested every time I wake up instead of baggy eyes. Feeling more productive in my hobbies. Even when I played a basketball game earlier I made more shots because I was telling myself I wasn't bad. \n\nIt's even helped me with my way of approaching women. Granted I'm still not experienced but I just went it with a \"fuck it\" type of energy and seem to be more likeable? Like recently in an online group there was a woman who was considered attractive in my head asking if there were other hot people who wanted to connect kind of jokingly. Old me would probably say some cringe stuff or flirt to try to get in her dms but now I was just like \"hey I'm hot your hot maybe we could make a connection\", mind you im average looking by all accounts but I had confidence. \n\nShe even said yes?! I was a little shocked but slid in the dms anyway and we even traded pics. Found out she likes horror movies and books like me so overall just talking. Eventually we also swapped pics and instead of saying I looked ugly I changed it too \"I have the face of a model but dont judge me for the lighting lol\". Crazy thing was she AGREED that I looked attractive?! \n\nSo basically what I want to say is too be more confident find whatever is making you feel down and just remove it from the equation because it does wonders for your mental. Also make sure to sleep in early and drink water as well. Helps refresh as well ",

      "selftext": "I truly believe in self improvement. I strive to be better while not losing myself in the process and I have a lot of qualities I see as toxic that I truly want to change. I don't like myself as I currently am because this version of myself seems like a nightmare to be around. Let me list the toxic flaws so you understand better.\n\n1. I am difficult. \n-this word is hard to hear. I don't like being told I'm difficult but I know deep down that it's true. As I currently am, yes I am difficult. \n\nWhat makes me difficult is my over defensiveness, need to justify everything I do. \n\nEx: let's say I forgot to wash dishes. It happens. We all have a busy life and things fall by the wayside. Now let's say I live with a roommate and the roommate politely tells me that I forgot to wash my dishes. One of the responses could be \"oh yeah. Thanks for telling me. I'll get to it\" but because I'm difficult, my response could be \"ok I know that Dylan (fake name) I don't need you tell me. I see it\" and Dylan can go \"I know you see it. I'm just reminding you\" and I go \"yes ok but I don't get the point of that. I see it already like I said.  I'm gonna get to it. I'm just tired\" \n\n2. Overthinking \n\n-I overthink every interaction, every response, every solution. This doesn't exactly say \"she's confident\" it might say \"don't reject me\" and it can truly be the smallest thing. \n\nEx: let's say there's a girl's trip and one of my friends named Julie is relaxing with a nice book by the beach. Perfectly fine. Oh no not to my overthinking mind. It asks \"is she bored? What if she's bored and she doesn't want to tell you? Does she even like the beach? Did you even ask? No, cuz you're too stupid. You can't ask because that makes you seem insecure\" then I ask anyway. \n\n3. I don't like being wrong. \n\n-ok. Not a lot of people like being wrong but it happens but I know it takes a strong person to admit they are wrong and that you can be a better person for it.  \n\nEx: let's say I believe Santa exists. I believe I am right. I am confident. My friend Lisa and I debate. I am proven wrong. My response is \"...well we all have our own beliefs. You shouldn't disprove people's beliefs like that\" I'm making excuses so I don't have to say I'm wrong.\n\nI HATE these parts of me like you guys can't imagine. I am what I dislike about other people, making me a hypocrite. Another word I hate. \n\nWhat's even more frustrating is I KNOW I can be better. I have been better than this before. I have shown confidence, been a good respectful debater, said on various occasions \"I am wong\" and didn't care what anyone was thinking and I loved that part of myself. The change seems to come around when I get close to people, when I start caring about them. When it's strangers, I'm good, I like myself. A lot of the advice I've gotten is \"find yourself. Be by yourself and discover who you are again\" the problem with that advice is that although that could work, the problem only comes when I'm with people I care about and goes back to normal when I'm not with people I care about. So, I'm thinking the problem is possibly fear of rejection with perfectionist tendencies. (Not a psychologist. Take what I'm saying with a grain of salt). \n\nI love myself when I'm not like this and I want to be that way again with or without people. I could really use some tips or advice. I just want to be the self I know I can be again and mantain it. ",

      "selftext": "Hello to everyone! I wish you all the best of luck on your self-improvement journey. \n\nIn all honesty, I don't know what's happening to me. I don't know where this obsession came from. I often think I'm too stupid because I struggle to remember things, and I'm 23 years old. I shouldn't struggle with this problem at this age. My brain is supposed to be in its prime... right? \n\nIt's not even just forgetting things. It's the fact that I think I am so incapable of what most healthy people do. For example, I don't drive. Everyone I know (and is over 18 years old) has their driver's license. My mom keeps asking me when I am going to start driving school. I never know what to tell her. How do I tell her that I don't believe I have the cognitive capacity for this step? I feel like I lack distributed attention. I feel like such a disappointment to my family, to myself. \n\nI am currently pursuing a Master's degree. Yeah, I know, how did I get here if I say I'm stupid? I don't know. Genuinely. I always got good grades, but never really remembered what I had learned after I was done with the exams. I hate it. I don't know how to learn. If I knew, the knowledge would still be there. I would still know how to use it. Because of that, I never worked a day in my life. I got lucky enough to earn a scholarship, and I'm not too much of a spender, so that wasn't a problem till now. I'm in my last year. There's no escape anymore. I won't be able to rely on good grades and scholarships. I feel like this year is going to eat me alive. I might be exaggerating, but I am really scared of what's going to happen to me. How am I going to work in this field if I don't remember essential things? I should be able to put my knowledge to good use. I don't know much besides the basic things. I'm studying Environmental Protection, by the way. It's such a diverse field, I don't think you'd get bored working in it. But you need knowledge. I don't know if it's because I never put this knowledge into practice, or if I really just am dumb. Being 23 and never working a day? That doesn't sound too great. \n\nI am currently in therapy. Well, I'm doing therapy from time to time. My therapist is telling me there's no point in taking an IQ test because it means nothing without emotional intelligence. I'm not saying that she's not right, but I honestly lack emotional intelligence, too. \n\nWhere would you start? What would you change? I've always blamed it on my mild childhood trauma. I can't do that anymore. I can't blame anyone else for the outcome of my adult life, and, boy, I couldn't choose a more awful way to start it. \n\nI'm sorry if this is too much. ",

      "title": "I don’t remember most of the books I’ve read, but they still changed my life",
      "selftext": "I used to doomscroll every night after work. Burnt out, numb, brain fried. I’d promise myself I’d just “relax for 5 mins” on TikTok, then suddenly it’s 1AM and I’m spiraling over my career, my future, my life. I felt stupid, anxious, disconnected. The turning point? A phone call with my uncle, who casually mentioned he’s read over 700 books. I asked, “Do you actually remember all of them?” He laughed and said, “Of course not. I probably forget 90%. But it still changed who I am.” That one sentence shook something in me. I started reading again. Slowly, at first. Now it’s my daily dopamine reset. One book a week. Reading didn’t make me “productive.” It made me present. Curious. Alive again.\n\nHere’s what I learned after diving deep into books, podcasts, and brain science over the past few years:\n\nReading isn’t about memorizing facts. That’s not how memory works. Cognitive scientist Daniel Willingham explains it like this: knowledge is scaffolding. Even if you forget 90%, the act of reading changes your brain’s structure. It builds invisible frameworks that help you understand more in the future. That’s why readers learn faster over time, it’s compounding, like interest.\n\nAndrew Huberman said in his podcast that learning sticks because of errors and friction. If something feels easy, your brain probably isn’t working very hard. Struggle signals growth. So yeah, if you forget what you read the next day? That’s normal. But if you retrieved it once, even poorly, your brain already rewired a bit.\n\nIn fact, there’s something called “desirable difficulties.” Psychologists like Elizabeth Bjork found that making things slightly harder to recall actually helps you remember them better long-term. So close the book after each chapter. Try to summarize it to yourself or in a note. Don’t just highlight pretty quotes and move on. You’re training your brain how to think, not what to store.\n\nThe real win of reading isn’t short-term recall. It’s identity-level change. Reading makes you see new angles. Feel new things. Think new thoughts. I might not remember the exact chapters from The Power of Now or Moonwalking with Einstein, but I remember who I became after reading them.\n\nA few things that helped me: The Extended Mind by Annie Murphy Paul: This book will flip how you think about thinking. She shows how learning is not just in your brain but also in your body, space, tools, and people around you. I started walking while reviewing ideas, sketching concepts, and even recording voice notes, and my retention skyrocketed. It made me realize how badly we underestimate our environment’s role in thinking. Easily one of the best books I’ve read on learning.\n\nI also love How to Take Smart Notes by Sönke Ahrens. This book is the blueprint if you want to actually use what you read. It teaches a note-taking method inspired by the Zettelkasten system. The idea is: you don’t collect quotes, you connect ideas. I started using his method with Notion and now actually revisit ideas weeks later instead of letting them disappear into the void. Best productivity read I’ve found for knowledge workers.\n\nAli Abdaal: He has some fire videos on how to read better and remember more, especially using spaced repetition and active recall. One that hit me hard: “You don’t need motivation. You need systems.” His 5-minute breakdowns on reading habits got me to stop binge-scrolling and start building rituals that stick.\n\nReadwise: I use this to resurface highlights from Kindle, articles, and podcasts every morning. It turns random ideas I forgot into daily flashbacks. A lot of them I’d totally forgotten, but when I see them again, I remember how they changed me. It’s like running into old friends from a past version of myself.\n\nMake It Stick by Brown, Roediger & McDaniel: This is the “anti-cramming” bible. I got recommended it by a coworker at Google and it legit changed how I study. It breaks down real research on why rereading doesn’t work and what does: retrieval, spacing, and variation. I read this two years ago. I still apply it every day. Insanely good read.\n\nI still forget most of what I read. But I’ve never been smarter, more focused, or more emotionally grounded than I am today. Reading didn’t fix my life. It helped me rebuild it, one highlight, one forgotten paragraph, one moment of perspective at a time.\n\n",

I talk to old friends but it’s not the same, and I just don’t care enough about new people to make friends with them. \n\nI’ve stopped putting myself out there, not because I don’t want to - but because the way people react to strangers is not the way I’d like to be treated.

NORMALLY. EVER. Every single fucking time I've tried to sit down and get shit done, I either pull out my phone, get lost in my own thoughts, or have to read the same thing like three times to actually comprehend it. It just takes me a ridiculous amount of time to get things done. When this would happen to me in high school, I often procrastinated until disgustingly late at night (like 1-2 AM) sometimes, and then had to practically pull teeth and kill myself to get assignments done. This sorta worked out for me (graduated with 3.65 GPA, attending 18% acceptance rate school), but this method has already been proven to not do me any favors in college. And before you give me any \"special trick\" bullshit, I don't want to hear it. I have quite literally tried everything. Pomodoro, Google Calendar, putting my phone on the other side of the room, putting a stopwatch in front of me so I know how long I'm taking, reading things out loud, scanning with my finger, going to different study locations, doing intermittent fasting to delay dopamine, screen time-checking apps, chewing gum, loading up on caffeine, listening to music, listening to white noise, listening to nothing at all. Nothing worked. Literally none of this has made a difference for me. Another thing to mention is that this is really the only aspect of my life where I have this problem. For example, I'm very consistent in the gym and strict with my diet (weigh all my food, track macros, etc.), so I don't think it's an issue of discipline/motivation. Is this ADHD? Surely I couldn't have made it this far in life while being undiagnosed? Either way, I need answers, because I know I'm gonna falter soon enough. ",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone! I would love some advice and tips on decompressing after work and not wasting away.. I know we all feel the burden of the government and the economy and our general future. I consider myself very lucky to have a job that pays enough for me to have an apartment and have a life somewhat. \n\nThe problem isn't the job it's not some insane multitasking job filled with meetings and stress etc... It's all one manager. She joined about two years ago and my life has been hell since my mental health has tanked. All the back stabbing corporate games blaming people for nothing etc it's a whole vibe in operations that's down the tank right now and she's the one at the top unfortunately. \n\nI come home and just absolutely rot from the mental struggle of trying to stay out the way and out of sight I barely feed myself I doom scroll i sleep late it's so unhealthy and I need to change. I have friends I have hobbies and a passion but I've had problems with depression in the past but I overcame them but this new manager and general life has it rearing it's head again. Maybe videos to meditation videos that helped people? any advice at all is appreciated truly and thank you for reading 😊",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone,\nI’ve been seeing this guy for a little over 2 years now. It’s been an on-and-off situation in the past because of long distance, but lately we’ve been trying to get back on track. The problem is, I’m really struggling with communication.\nAt the beginning, it felt easier.. there wasn’t much commitment, and I could just say whatever I felt in the moment. But now, I find myself going quiet whenever something happens. I’ll sit there, overthinking and analyzing what happened, trying to form words. He usually notices and asks me what’s wrong, but I just shut down because I don’t know how to explain it yet. \n\nEventually, after he gives me space, I’ll try to bring it up. But by then, it takes me forever to say what I mean. Sometimes, even when I do communicate, I end up upset because I’ve been holding it in and he had no idea what I was feeling (which I know isn’t his fault). and the worst part is that this only happens with him, i consider myself very straightforward when it comes to others but suddenly go blank infront of him. I realize this is frustrating for both of us, and it makes me feel immature. But I’m genuinely ready to fix it, i just don’t know how to start.\n\nTL;DR: I (19F) struggle with communicating in my relationship. I shut down, overthink, and then struggle to explain myself. My boyfriend gets frustrated because he doesn’t know why I’m upset. I want to fix this but don’t know how.",

      "selftext": "So I used to have about 10 online friends and 4 irl friends, it was amazing, I had what I thought to be great connections with all of them, eventually tho they stopped talking to me, or got mad at me and left, or they outright blocked me without explanation.\n\nSomething stupid I did was I used alts to try and talk to the people who blocked me, it was stalkerish so the ones I still had I stopped using and/or told those people who I was and left. This is the kind of bad person I am, this is a rare time where I had reflected on myself and realized the what/why, that was the what.\n\nThe why, however, is more complicated, I'll start with this: whenever I experience loss of friends, people getting mad at me, or anything socially negative, I shake/shiver and act stupidly impulsive, so far I can not manage this and it can also happen when remembering things, it prevents me from sleeping and has caused nightmares. As a result from the impulsivity, I immediately try to think of solutions: \"how do I get them to like me again?\" \"Should I come back?\" \"When should I come back?\" And these are valid things to want to know, but that's all I think of. Essentially, I have trouble with boundaries. All I think of is \"get to the end goal\" not \"what steps do I take, and is this end goal attainable (and reasonable)?\"\n\nI think the biggest issue is I have a big ego and low self esteem; \"I'm a shitty person, but the people around me are part of the problem\", I've realized this is how I deflect blame, but how do I stop it?\n\nPeople don't usually take you back unless it's on their terms. And chances are they don't want to talk to you if they don't want you back. That's my understanding as of now. I don't cope well and I don't know how to cope, so anyone got any suggestions? Also sorry for being real bad, just want to do better now lol.",

Like doing good things for others\nAnd listening (which I suck at)\n\nI have also realized Im quite an a attention seeker (almost every little thing I do is for people to look at me and talk about me) whether it's good or bad) and I have also realized that I have been used manipulative tools alot against people to get what I want without really knowing. (I think but to be honest I don't know what I'm thinking or. Feeling half of the time) I'm also a really bad listener. (which I mentioned before) and almost don't care about what people talk about at all (from surface level stuff like hobbys and favourite movies to deep level stuff like heartbreaks,or having hard times with friends or family. I try my best when it's deep stuff(I lack empathy and sympathy) . If someone they loved passed away.yes I do feel for the person). And since I don't care about what they are talking about.i just worry about what I'm going to say but at the same time don't know how to respond (I have no social skills) .I also want to know do I become more genuinely nice. I mean\nI can. Like one in a blue moon but most of the time, I just fake it case I don't really care about people (atleast anymore) \n\nAnd another one of my problems\nIs how do I become more honest with myself and others. Like I lie and twist truth In my own head and \nTowards other people. (I can be honest but then alot of time add lies or overexaggerate the story or the things I'm saying) I'm thinking that that might be some sort of form of manipulation. But idk. Going back to the topic of manipulation. I dont really know if last year I was guilt tripping. Because that's what some of old friends said and then I denied and they cut contact away from me. I just viewed it as expressing my pain (all tho I did talk about my pain alot) but I didn't really think about it. Butnow that I'm trying to better myself. I've been thinking about the past and I'm starting to notice what my old friends from last year were seeing. That's why I'm thinking I might be a manipulater without knowing it. I do always want what I want. (sorry if I'm over using the same words over and over again imnot a good writer.) also my mum said I'm over thinking about all of this stuff cause it's been stressing me out. And it's been the only thing I've been talking and thinking about. So how do I clear or slow my mind down. So I can be calm and stop overthinking \nBut still work on self improvement (yeah everything right now is stressing me out) .(and I have low self esteem. I should also mention that. And people stress me out. I don't like people that much) \n\nSo I'm just asking for a help with anything that I have said on this post\n\nThank you \n\n(hope I made sense.i rushed this post)\n\n\n\n\n",

This I think is because I had dreams and aspirations and I felt like things were going to work out. Some things did, but others didn’t.\n\nAfter this I have had nothing to work towards/improve upon. Not necessarily because I’ve reached peak, but maybe because the quicker results I had originally are not coming as quickly now.\n\nFor example: Originally I set out to be more hygenic and healthier. So I cut out junk food, and got better hygiene. Now, I can’t get as quick results as I did then.\n\nAnyone else have this? How to get back to feeling like how did?\n",

I was non existent in almost everyone’s eyes in school and even at work as an adult. The only person who truly cared is my wife who I met in college. Anyway even after marriage I still retained my loser tendencies and I was sick of it. I hated myself and beat myself up all the time. \n\nSo I decided I would start working out to gain some self confidence. This was a big commitment for me. I would start eating right, track my macros and consistently workout 5x a week. Throughout my workout journey I discovered another passion-calisthenics. Since I was already light and was able to do pull-ups since high school I trained into it more. Now I could do some advanced moves such as handstands, front+back lever, and the human flag. So naturally, from all this I gained a lot of lean muscle. But no one seems to notice/care? Other than my wife she compliments me all the time but no one else seems to care about your achievements. I know ‘you do it for yourself’ but coming from a background where I was often looked down on it would be nice if there was some approval? I’ve only gotten like 3 comments from someone other than my wife or family about my change. No one cares about you at the beach or water park except maybe you get 1-2 stares. Is this the reality? You do it for yourself that no one will ever notice or care and you die still as a loser? Fml ",

I feel like I can't get out of the way of my own bullshit.\n- I feel like an outsider. I have enough insight to know it's not true, but I still feel like everyone else is miles ahead of me when it comes to being efficient, productive, educated, and just generally having their life together.

I honestly think it is worthless to live if I’ll never succeed or be recognized - if I never feel anything good, and want to end it everyday. \n\nI know people say that failure is how you learn, and I put a ridiculous amount of effort in things like sports and school, but when do I actually succeed?

I’ve been in the gym for a long long time, but recently a girl joined that I just thought was absolutely stunning. \n\nI’ve spent weeks in my head going over what I would say if I were to ask her out, and while working out with my friends today I saw she was there. My friends kept pushing me to ask her out because they knew I wanted to and I just kept saying no over and over. But then I saw her walking down the stairs to leave and while my friend was mid sentence speaking to me I just bolted away and went up to her and said to her I’d love to take her out for food some time, and she said yes! \n\nMy script that I had prepared in my head completely fell apart but I found comfort in the fact she was just as nervous as I was as she went really red it was cute, but regardless I secured the date.\n\nSpent weeks working up the courage, almost didn’t pull through, but I’m so glad I did.\n\nJust felt like sharing that win incase it encourages anyone else to take that leap they have been wanting to but are scared of doing. It’s so worth it!\n\nEdit: had the date today, went amazing! Going on another one next week. \n\nEdit #2: it’s been made apparent to me from some comments that some people may be under the impression that I am tall and attractive and that’s why it worked out for me. I am 5ft 7, wouldn’t call that particularly tall. I wouldn’t call myself ugly, but I certainly wouldn’t call myself an eye catcher in terms of attractiveness, very much average. Just work with the cards you are dealt people, no one wins by immediately folding. It’s playing the best game you can with the cards you’re dealt that counts, and that will always involve taking risks. So take the risk!",

We think to ourselves \"my situation may be bad now, but the reason why it's not worse than it is, is because I keep myself on a tight leash\".\n\nAlternatively, many of us have memories of making mistakes (big ones!) and thinking to ourselves, I should have been more careful, I should have been more alert, I should have been aware that this was going to happen. \"Never again will I trust myself to live my life well\" we say.\n\nBut if you think about it, that doesn't make sense at all. I mean... how do you prevent mistakes that you're going to make later on today? There's no way! There's no innoculation from mistakes. It's almost as if you're a mortal, fallible human who's moving through life as best as they can!\n\nTrusting yourself doesn't mean you won't get things wrong. Trusting is just a gift that you give yourself. It's like sitting in the seat of your life as opposed to hovering over it nervously, with one cheek in your chair.

      "title": "I let my low self esteem and anxiety ruin my relationship. Can I save it?",
      "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI (22M) have been dating my girlfriend (22F) for about a year now. Shortly before we began dating I put a label on something I identified within myself: I have low self esteem. I told her this early on. Early on, our relationship was great, it felt good. We were both seniors in college and spent our last year in this new relationship, getting to know each other. There a few times when my insecurities were bared open and it caused some conflict, but we had a conversation about it and things went back to feeling good. Come Summer, and my mental health took a downturn. We spent a lot of time together, but it was a struggle as both of us were having mental troubles and heavy emotional stuff going on. Now she started a full time job, and I've started full time grad school, and my mental health has honestly spiraled. I'm digging myself a hole in classes, I feel depressed, my self image is poorer than ever, and our relationship doesn't feel like it used to.\n\nNow, combine that with anxiety (and relationship anxiety) and this has resulted in some negative things in our relationship, coming from my side. From the beginning, I have put her on a pedestal in my mind. It's been almost constant comparison between me and her, and with my poor self image, I find her to be better than me on almost every front. Whether it be our financial independence, work ethic, attractiveness, social skills, friendships, familial relationships, maturity— it caused me torment in my low moments. I dwelled on how she possessed everything I lacked. This resulted in feelings of inadequacy and low confidence that has plagued me this entire relationship, and because I left these issues unaddressed, it has spiraled into a significant problem and is actively ruining (or ruined) our relationship. My anxious thoughts cause my mind to race and spiral, often taking on these flavors: constantly thinking she doesn't like me, wondering if she wishes she had someone better who possessed x y z quality that I lack, thinking she deserves someone better, that I'm not good enough for her because of x y z.\n\nOften these racing thoughts would amp up at night when I was attempting to fall asleep. Even worse when I was falling asleep next to her. My mind would criticize all the things I did wrong when we spent time together that day. This was of course, my twisted perception of things, but the constant self-bullying in my mind caused my heart to race and feelings of inadequacy tormented me. As a result I struggle with sleep, and I have had whole days severely affected by my lack of sleep, and often making my mental health worse.\n\nThere are times in this relationship where I let her down and made what should have been a fun day, or important day, all about myself. It was her birthday last month, and I let her down because I refused to hang out with her. On her birthday, I went out with her and all her friends, and due to my self-consciousness, I felt distant from her and felt I didn't properly fit in with her friends. I really wanted to spend time with her one-on-one, but she invited me the following day to more hangouts with her friends, and I felt bitter about it, and worried about socializing and what they would think of me, that I made up some excuse not to go. Then later that night, I met up with her and explained how I felt so inadequate with her friends, and a little bitter that we didn't get to spend one-on-one time for her birthday. I made her birthday weekend about myself.\n\nAnd here was the breaking point. This past weekend, she was looking forward to going home to visit her parents for the first time in a while, and she wanted me to come along and had planned fun activities. Despite some strong self consciousness, overall stress and anxiety about school and the relationship, it was going okay, until nighttime came and I could not fall asleep. All the self consciousness I felt during the day and all the stress and anxiety came to the fore in my mind, and I felt helpless. I knew that if I didn't fall asleep, I would struggle to function the following day, which would take me out of everything and I wouldn't be present for her. This stress about losing sleep ironically made it HARDER to fall asleep. And in this moment of panic, I woke her up in the middle of the night, and while she was half-asleep, I bore out all my insecurities to her in a panicked, crying state. I expressed how I didn't feel like a normal person, and that I wish she could've known me years ago when I was a more confident person. This stuck with her, as she realized that I don't think she should be with the version of myself that I am now. And it broke her. The two nights I was there, I did this to her. I leaned on her super heavy and I crossed a line.\n\nDuring the time I have been with her, she's been almost the sole bearer of my emotional burden. And she's shown love and care towards me, but subconsciously I've never been able to fully internalize and accept her love. I have constantly wondered what she sees in me, if she likes me, if she finds me attractive, etc.\n\nBut this weekend it's all boiled over. The next day we met and talked, cried, and she told me that she's been unhappy. It's been exhausting to deal with my emotional issues and she doesn't even feel like my girlfriend. She's been angry with me because I took the joy out of these important moments and made them about my insecurities. She's always stressed to me that I need to fix it, but I have never taken it seriously. She told me she wants to take space for a few days.\n\nIn this time, I have decided to address it head on. I reconnected with friends I hadn't spoken to in a bit. I opened up to my family about my problems, which was huge for me, as I had kept it hidden from them. I scheduled an appointment with a university therapist and also spoke to a counselor on the phone briefly. I am getting a handle on my schoolwork and overall thinking more positive thoughts about myself than before. I'm making an effort to build a social life outside of our relationship. I feel less alone now in my struggle. And I am trying my hardest to not spiral about the space we are taking, and the worry that the end of our relationship is here. I truly believe I can improve, that I can fix things. Even all of this, I hadn't seen everything so clearly until now, and it's changed the way I look at things almost overnight.\n\nWe are currently taking space, and it worries me that she wants to end the relationship. And honestly, maybe that's what needs to be done. I love her, and she loves me, so it's not an easy decision. But maybe, it's not worth throwing away. I honestly don't know. Is there a way I can save this relationship? What's the best course of action? What do I say to her when we talk again?\n\ntl;dr: I’ve let my low self-esteem and anxiety put a huge strain on my relationship by leaning too much on my girlfriend emotionally, and now she’s asked for space — I’m finally seeking help, but I don’t know if I can save the relationship.",

Each year I feel more alone, lost, and helpless. I don’t feel worthy of this life. I’ve never had a real friend, and I’ve never held a consistent job because I’ve struggled with what I think are bipolar tendencies since I was 17 (self-diagnosed). The last shift I worked was in August 2023. Since then I’ve been living at home with my mom and stepdad and mostly kept to myself.\n\nA few things that happened in the past few years: I bought self improvement courses aimed at men; they drained my bank account and didn’t help. I felt used and manipulated.\n\nIn 2022 I quit alcohol and started practicing yoga that’s the one consistent, positive habit I’ve kept.\n\nI never got my driver’s license because I’m afraid of driving, and I haven’t developed any marketable skills I can rely on.\n\nI quit weed earlier this year but started again recently after failing to find a job following my move back with my mom in April.\n\nI have about $2,300 in savings now.\n\nI’m losing hope and don’t see much use for my existence in society or for myself right now. I’m not looking for sympathy. I want practical steps. Before I do anything drastic like “dropping out” (that’s how it feels), what should I try? What are realistic, small actions I can take now to improve my situation; emotionally, socially, and financially?\n\nIf you’ve been in a similar spot and turned things around, what did you actually do (not platitudes)? If you know low cost resources for mental health, jobs that accept people with spotty work histories, or starter programs that teach real skills without taking advantage of you, please help.",

Now I’m in my mom’s basement, struggling to find work, feeling completely lost.\n\nHere’s the thing, I’ve wanted to start a YouTube channel for almost 5 years.

They can't even be bothered to wave when they drive by me, I am invisible.

This is what intentionality got me; erased from someones existence.\n\nI am really struggling with it all. Being dropped from existence with no way to talk it through, apologize, or anything.

      "title": "Getting free from destructive habits is easy",
      "selftext": "Hey, I have found the only working way against every addictive habit that works like a charm. Okay so after reading every self improvement book and listening to online gurus I found one thing that is the most important, leave instant gratification and start loving delayed gratification. For those who do not know, IG is every habit that realeses reward chemicals immediately after performing or right before performing the said activity (porn, junk food, tik toks/reels/shorts, social media etc). Delayed Gratification activities are the polar opposite, they often reward late (Working out, eating healthy, working on a business, meditation etc). So you can say that the root cause of every problem is this, because IG habits pull you away from self discipline and self discipline can solve your every problem, think finances. mental and physical health, love life etc. Most of these IG habits are engineered by huge corporations to be insanely rewarding and therefore the DG habits can not come close and therefore you do not feel like doing anything productive. What if I tell you even though these corporations are spending billions of dollars to make you more hooked, you still stand a chance. And once you understand the solution you will realise that you dont just stand a chance, you actually hold an advantage and the system is rigged for you to win.\n\n  \nI am sorry I did not want to sound so preachy I just felt the above information is super important before we move further ahead. Okay so basically the core of this solution is every addictive behaviour you cannot quit is not something you enjoy even a little bit, there is a seperate entity inside of you that is different from the real you. Jack Trimpey calls it the \"Beast\" in his AVRT module, Old Hindu texts call it Kali Purush, for Goggins its the 'Bitch Voice\". Scientifically your brain responsible for the real you is the Prefrontal Cortex and the beast brain is the limbic part of your brain and it does exactly how avrt, goggins and countless others describes their inner addict. Once you realise and disassociate this voice of that entity from your own self you win, its over. Everything you have been struggling with for years gone. Thats what happened with me and with others I share this knowledge with. It is not as easy as it sounds and you probably know it, you have been struggling with it for way too long. \n\n  \nI will share step by step instructions on what helped me and will help you too:\n\n  \nStep 1: Get a Journal. It is the biggest weapon you have in your arsenal so its a non negotiable. You have been giving up power to the beast for decades therefore to reinforce this new thought process will need constant journaling. You are going to journal what your beast wants you to do vs what you really want to do. Like \"My beast is manipulating me into thinking I deserve a reward after a hard day and should scroll some tik toks vs I don't actually like scrolling tik toks, they leave me with an empty feeling and make me less focused on the real world and whats going on around me. Do I even remember the video I watched last night?\" example 2 \"My beast is telling me to smoke some weed, it is trying to make me believe I should smoke some its been a while. vs Me honestly I do not know why I even smoke weed, it makes me impaired, lazy and once it wears off I feel restless and frustrated\" \n\nConstantly use a journal to differentiate between your own thoughts vs the beast. You will need a journal to realise you are chasing these IG habits only due to the beast and there is no real happiness in them.\n\n  \nStep 2: Make a list of your bad habits that you really wanna get control on, start with the worst. Take your time with it,for the first few days do those habits but observe how the beast is manipulating you and how you do not really like doing it. Once it clicks you will leave that habit quickly with no pain.\n\n  \nStep 3; Observe how your beast will try to compensate you leaving that habit with another destructive habit. When I quit doomscrolling, beast tried to compensate it with long form content. Do not let is compensate, repeat the step two with the substitute habit. Now once you feel comfortable move on to the next habit and step 2 until you are satisfied.\n\n  \nIt might not work as fast and might take a while to click but once it does, the process is painless. The only thing suffering is your beast and you are at a bliss. Once you leave IG habits it will take a lot of time to recalibrate your brain but you will start seeing process within just 2 weeks. Tilll you become productive take time to journal about more things and start sitting empty without any work or task. After a while your brain will be comfortable with doing nothing, its a powerful habit. \n\n  \nPersonally it took me 2 weeks to finally quit every bad habit and get control on them. After a month or so I started feeling more productive and my business started booming. Once you slowly start feeling productive I suggest read Atomic Habits to build new habits, before that focus on breaking the bad ones. I highly suggest you check out the AVRT modules on youtube, although they are about alcohol they will help you recognise the beast.",

For me I get super motivated to change my life for maybe a week and then I fall back into my bad habits, like sleeping super late, and eating too much food and scrolling the days away. I have the intention to Study Japanese, workout, and Draw everyday but there’s this part of me that just doesn’t want to change!\n\nIt’s been like this all throughout High School. I felt that only on Luck did I even manage to pass HS. (I admittedly am a C grade student) Wanting to change and yet falling back into my laziness. It’s so frustrating, really! However let me give some examples of things I’m good at.\n\nI’m a person that really likes to do hard things. If you tell me to go run 3 miles with my weight vest, I’m going to do it believe me! And it’s even evident in the games I play, (the From Soft games are my favorite franchise) I love the challenge! But I guess when it comes to me, I struggle with listening to what I want, and I turn to what I find pleasurable. \n\nAlso I am currently learning Japanese, however I’m putting in minimal effort. I’m only studying before my tutoring sessions and it shows. And I am also a person who wants to draw professionally, however I haven’t committed to drawing in MONTHS. \n\nSorry if I sound robotic or anything, just not good at talking I guess 😅, but if anybody could help me out, thank you so much!",

I'm not walking on these insufferable people's eggshells to avoid getting downvoted anymore. If I come back decades from now with negative karma, it doesn't matter.

      "selftext": "I don’t want to be this person anymore. I don’t want to feel everything all the time. \n\nI tried for so many years to lock up my feelings and while on the outside I was calm and nonchalant, I self harmed I had angry ridiculous blow ups, I was self destructive. Then I got diagnosed with BPD in my early twenties. I thought to myself I’m not crazy, I feel all these intense feelings for a reason. Then I got regular therapy and I was medicated and I felt like I came to like myself, hell even love myself. \n\nThrough therapy I realized a lot of my intense emotions came from when I felt wronged and I didn’t have any safety to share those feelings with out it being my fault that someone did that to me. I.e. my ex husband being a pathological liar, narcissist, victim, but it was my fault because I was too emotional that’s he couldn’t tell me the truth about anything ; or my mom being a sub par parent sometimes because I wasn’t being the way she wanted me to be. \n\nBut now I’m “all grown up” almost 30 years old and I’m still too emotional. I don’t have anyone in my support system really. I have no friends left because all the friends I had used my empathic nature to help themselves but often when I needed them it wasn’t worth their time. All I have left is my kids, my husband and my mom. My mom is a very, “women are too fru fru, talk to much have to many emotions “ kind of woman. My husband is a good guy, but as my mother says is “a man and doesn’t have the capacity for all that emotion”. So sometimes I feel, no matter how I truly feel in my heart how justified I am to be hurt I’m met with an eye roll or “why do I care”, or “this isn’t a big deal just let it go. Why does everything have to be a big deal?” \n\nExample: today, my husband who’s a trucker lost service while I was in the middle of telling him about this documentary I’m really excited to see. Instead of just the common “hey sorry I lost you” once he got service back, he was just kind of dismissive and didn’t even ask what I had been talking about. So because we had a conversation literally yesterday about having better communication (so I felt like I even had room to tell him how I felt) I told him it wasn’t a big deal just would’ve liked a passive apology and maybe a call back once he was done with his business. I got “🙄 fine I’m sorry. Let’s not fight” I never wanted to fight.. just simple acknowledgement would’ve been fine. We have this issue a lot where me addressing even the smallest thing causes a fight because I simply shouldn’t care. So it hurt me. I outwardly didn’t say anything to him but when I saw my mom about an hour later I tried explaining the situation and just that I was mainly sad that it had been less than 24 hours and I was still getting massive defensiveness over something small. As soon as I said what happened I got an eye roll and a sigh, “seriously OP why does this even matter? Who cares?” \nI just broke down at that point because, maybe they’re right who does care? They don’t, I certainly shouldn’t? Maybe normal people don’t?? \n\nI know I likely wouldn’t be so emotionally raw if I wasn’t constantly brushed aside or invalidated, but that’s just not how my life is. So I need to, I have to learn how to not care about things that to me are just common courtesy, common respect, compassionate things so that I’m not constantly hurt. I know people are human and I forgive people for their mistakes to a fault, I’m so willing to forgive, but since I never get an apology no matter what. I have to learn how not to care. \n\nHow do I do that? Please someone anyone tell me how if there’s like a switch to flip to stop caring about things it seems no one else cares about? ",

Coming in full acceptance of the present and being present, detaching from my ego, and detached from outcomes. \n\nThe big thing for me was social rejection and general failure. I used to be so impacted by such things but nowadays I am calm, composed and if I ever fail or perform low, I just logically look at the best way to improve and move forward and don’t ruminate on it for a bit. Its almost like I’m unphased by these things anymore because I stopped labeling myself and others, and also stopped engaging in mental delusions of the ego. Instead of ruminating I focus on what I can improve and I am not attached to anything. \n\nThe loneliness and failure don’t phase me like that. In fact this detachment and equanimity helped me make better connections with people, have more friends and perform better overall because I am not attaching myself to the success or failure or the ego. \n\nIs this normal and is this a good or bad thing?

      "title": "How to get unstuck from fear-avoidance loops? How to stay consistent and make progress despite setbacks and failures?",
      "selftext": "Hey guys, I need some advice. I am 27M and I am recovering from health issues from 3 years ago that led me to quit my old big tech job. I burnt out 1 year after graduating and my digestion got fucked. I took a break for 7 months before I found another WFH job. I was slowly recovering and getting stronger after losing a lot of weight, but I started to lose the initial passion and motivation when I first started. \n\nBy 2024, I was getting distracted really easily and procrastinating a lot. I would have a huge workload by the end of the sprint and the nearing deadline kind of forced me to stop being lazy and work long hours to finish everything. By the end of 2024, I started burning out. I was always behind and could never catch up completely. We have sprint deadlines every 3 weeks, and I didn't put as much effort at the end of the sprints because the workload seemed so overwhelming (even though its like 3-4 tickets). \n\nNow in 2025, I have not been productive at all and I've been carrying over work across every sprint. I was afraid that I was going to lose my job and did what I could to finish something before the sprint. It's been so stressful around this period but I realize that if I just worked consistently every day instead of procrastinating and freezing, I could have finished all my work early and got ahead.\n\nBUT I NEVER LEARN and I keep repeating the same mistakes. The new sprint just started and I already wasted almost 2 days. I know how bad it is and I feel like a complete failure. I tried to follow the conventional advice of breaking things down, focusing for 15-25 minute periods but I keep getting distracted or giving up when I get stuck. I've tried watering it down to 5 minute blocks and I still can't do that.\n\nMy focus is fucked, I feel like I have brain fog, I get so tired after eating any meal and the growing workload makes me freeze even more. It's just a never-ending cycle of misery and shame and stress and fear, and I'm tired of it. I feel like I lost my passion for my job and after work, I don't do any hobbies. \n\nI try to go to the gym but I'm so tired most of the day that sometimes I just skip. I tried forcing myself to go, and I feel good after finishing the workout. But when I come back and eat, I'm just so tired again and I procrastinate on chores and I don't get ahead on learning other stuff, studying for interviews, applying to jobs, etc. \n\nMy project is ending in 5 months. I have to find a job before then. I have a lot of time, but I haven't done anything except complete 1 easy leetcode coding problem in the past 2 weeks. I've just been trying to catch up on all the work I currently have. And I barely made progress. My team has been super understanding and willing to scope down the tasks and move the goalposts so I can focus on getting a smaller part done in the remaining days of each sprint. I feel so guilty for not being able to finish all my tasks. \n\nI graduated Summa Cum Laude from college before the pandemic. I used to work till 2 or 3 am every day. I pushed myself so hard. I was so productive. I landed a great job at a reputable company, and I fumbled that in 1.5 years. I quit like a loser. Mostly because of health issues, but everything was self-inflicted. I wish I just managed my time wisely and adopted a growth mindset and using each mistake or failure as an opportunity to grow instead of confirming my worst fears that I'm an imposter or fraud.\n\nNow I can barely focus, I get so tired throughout the day and especially at night, I don't sleep enough and sleep really late, I doomscroll and I succumb to stupid urges. \n\nIf I can't handle my current straightforward job with UI and Java/SQL tasks, how am I supposed to handle other jobs with stricter deadlines and more complex tasks and responsibilities? I am living with my parents and I barely have any responsibilities except for cleaning dishes, meal prep (my mom does most of the cooking), grocery shopping and cleaning most of the house on the weekends. \n\nHow am I supposed to handle a relationship or marriage or family? I feel like I'm washed. Like I'm past my prime. I'm still in my 20s but everything feels so hopeless. And the pressure of arranged marriage is weighing on me. \n\nI need to find a therapist soon, but I keep procrastinating on that. I don't trust doctors too much after they misdiagnosed me and prescribed me medications whose side effects messed up my body even more, and the effects are still there. \n\nI feel like my health is in limbo, and I'm gonna make it worse with the current stress and fears. My fitness is plateauing and I'm barely gaining muscle and I'm not going to the gym consistently or sleeping or eating enough protein. My career is going down the drain and I'm worried I won't find another good job.\n\nOn top of that, my social life is fucked as I only have a few friends in the area and even they rarely hang out with me anymore. My dating life is nearly non-existent with only 1 date and that is a story for another time. But that date was so bad, and it further led me into a downward spiral.\n\nHow do I get unstuck from this neverending spiral and get back up quickly after a setback? How do I maintain positivity and hope despite all of the stressors and fears and societal/career/family pressure? I know I have to keep going but I feel like I barely have the energy to push myself and try again anymore. I am so lost and confused, I will appreciate any advice. I don't want to be like this anymore. I need to improve. I feel like time is running out and I'm wasting my prime years.",

The hardest part is that I don’t have like-minded or motivated people around me, so I have to push myself completely on my own, which gets mentally heavy after a while.

      "selftext": "Hello there,\n\nI've considered myself to have decent mental fortitude for most of my life. However, I'm self aware enough to realize that I've been mentally fragile off late. Like I've noticed that small shit has been triggering me, and I havent been able to let go of things as easy as I used to be able to. \n\nFor example, a family member likes to constantly compare me to my parents, who were terrible people, full knowing that this is one of the very few things that could make me cry and get a reaction out of me. Another example is when my boyfriend made a few jokes about a sensitive topic recentish, and we had a discussion about it, and it is now water under the bridge to me. \n\nBut I still find myself thinking about those things, and feeling depressed about it. Even though I know I should not be letting the words and actions of other people affect me this much. Its not like I am wanting to argue with my aunt or boyfriend over this petty shit, but at the same time, I find myself growing more and more apathetic toward life, and I just want to run away from everything and start new somewhere else. I've also just had an itch for change recently too, aside from those two issues.\n\nThe old me would've told myself to focus on the future, to pick myself up and carry on. I just hate that im regressing, and regression is the one thing I've truly always been afraid of. I believe the goal of (at least my) life is to wake up a better person than I was the day before, and emotionally (and physically) evolve. And I find myself waking up a weaker person now. Its just so scary to watch yourself regress, and feel completely powerless. I suspect I have GAD/depression, but I cant afford therapy/meds since im on a very high deductible insurance plan. I try my best to read self improvement books (I used to think they were useless and for fragile people in the past, but I now see the use and benefit in them), watch videos on how to regulate your emotions better, how to let things go and make peace with the fact that some things just aren't meant to be, and in general, how to have better control and autonomy over my emotions. \n\nThe one thing I've feared all my life was emotional weakness. Mental fortutude is the only thing I've somewhat been proud of myself for having, and now I see that I am losing that as well. \n\nIm 22 if it matters at all. Any insight is much appreciated, as I feel like I'm stumbling through the darkness, and can't find my way home.\n\nThank you.",

      "selftext": "for the longest time, I had a toxic relationship with my phone. I’m sure some of you can relate. It was a miserable cycle of picking up my phone \"just for a second\" and then suddenly realizing 2-3 hours had vanished into a black hole of random videos and social media feeds. I felt unproductive, guilty, and completely drained.\n\nI tried every app blocker and digital wellness tool out there, but they never stuck. They all felt like a punishment, like a digital slap on the wrist. Inevitably, I’d get frustrated, disable them, and fall right back into the same bad habits.\n\nThe problem wasn't the apps; it was the psychology. People don't respond well to punishment, but we are wired to work for rewards.\n\nSo I had an idea: What if I couldn't just take screen time, but had to earn it?\n\nI spent the last 8 months teaching myself how to build an app that would do just that. I called it CaBBy's Brain Bites (cause I like capybaras lol). The system is simple, To earn time for mindless scrolling later, I first have to do something mindful now. I complete a few fun trivia questions (about science, history, etc.) or check off a simple, positive goal like \"read 10 pages of a book\" or \"do 5 minutes of stretching.\" Each completed task adds minutes to my \"guilt-free\" screen time bank.\n\nSlowly but surely, it started to work. My doomscrolling habit was being replaced by micro-doses of learning and well-being. I'm actually retaining fun facts, I'm stretching more, and most importantly, the time I *do* spend on my phone feels like a well-deserved break, not a guilt trip.\n\nIt helped me so much that I decided to polish it up and put it on the Google Play Store, hoping it might help someone else stuck in the same cycle.\n\nIf this story resonates with you, or if you're looking for a different way to manage your screen time that's based on positive reinforcement instead of punishment, I'd be honored if you checked it out.",

      "selftext": "So pretty much, since i was very young, my parents were quite strict so i always did everything to please them, everything i did was in order for them to be proud of me, even way more compared to my brothers, but it got worse throughout my teen years when most of the things i said to classmates and friends etc were just lies, telling them things in order to gain sympathy or praise. Things that literally could be meaningless, like saying that I played for a slightly prestigious football academy or lying about the music i listen to. Over the years that developed to me actually having little personality or deep desire of my own, being quite shy and seeming across as very insecure, assuming everybody else is always right, getting bothered by the tone of people of how others speak to me and even getting bothered by comments online. Being like this comes to me naturally even, I get scared of asking my work colleagues and boss questions about work, i get nervous whenever talking to them, I am very mindful of my self image because to the point where i became the complete opposite of the stereotypes people have about my racial group. And anything i try to do with confidence i start to feel like it isn’t really me, that i’m forcing trying to be someone that isn’t me. It genuinely feels like it’s in my nature to seek approval, be insecure and shy and struggle with social interactions. What can I do to gain confidence, stop caring so much about the external opinions of others, especially work colleagues and bosses, older family members, and random elderly folk and women?\n",

      "title": "Learning what “better” means",
      "selftext": "Ever since I was young I had a goal to become rich. Because of this I started building tech @8 years old. After realizing how difficult it is to ship a physical project I taught myself how to program @14. I’ve been doing this ever since. \n\nAnd since I’ve been doing this for more than half my life my main joys and sorrows came almost exclusively from what I could create and ship. My happiness and sense of worth was tied tightly to the impressiveness of my project, and several values on my analytics dashboard.\n\nFinally after years of this I achieve a taste of success that to me felt like proof of my ability. I got an investor of 100s thousand dollars with “checkpoints” to unlock much more money dedicated to simply allow me to focus exclusively on any project I choose. No hand holding, no periodic checkups, just completely autonomy. This was a dream scenario. \n\nIronically around this same time I had recently separated with my first ever gf. So what was a dream scenario was just became an extremely confusing time of self doubt and challenge. \n\nRegardless I decided to drop out of school and dedicate all my time into not wasting this fantastic opportunity. \n\nFor the next 2 years all I did was eat, sleep, research and program. All day, everyday. During this time I created 3 mobile apps and several web apps. I dabbled with employment, social media and paid ads. Dealing with payroll, taxes and a kaleidoscope of other business that I have no experince or idea how to do. Plus trying my best to not waste the money I was given. And scattered about was learning new programming tools and this AI stuff. My mental health was all over the place. \n\nIn addition to this my mom was dealing with cancer and her life was something that wasn’t guaranteed. (she’s healthy now) Lots of things got repressed during this time.\n\nOver the course of these 2 years I realized that programming and thinking about businesses from sunup to sun down is not sustainable. I found that the foods I ate, my sleep, all directly affected my daily performance. I began pouring my doubt and stress into optimizing my health. \n\nIt started out with me obsessing about room temperature, then optimizing my time for best focus. Then workstation optimization to reduce eye, hand and neck strain.\n\nAt one point it was so crazy that I had a spreadsheet plotting every 5 minutes so I could figure out why my day was gone without me finishing my daily tasks. \n\nDuring this time I also recorded daily update videos, adding to the pressure and stress. Looking back at those videos I look absolutely sick, but I believed this was what it takes to achieve my goals.\n\nSoon my health got so bad that I would sleep for 12+ hours, going days with talking to anyone. And i was so thin. \n\nSome days I would just lay down, not because i was tired but because I was literally unable to move my arms and legs. And i’ll just sit there, for hours trapped in my own body. The guilt of knowing millions of people would kill to be in my position and all I could do was lay down.\n\nWith all this time thinking I began dabbling in religion and philosophy which set the groundwork’s for my own personal ideas of God, morality and a good life. \n\nI was forced to realize the necessity of patience and alignment. How we are products of our environments bound only by how conscious we are of our interdependence. Belief, wit and discipline are not enough, physical constraints must be considered.\n\nI soon began to think something was wrong with me.\n\nI began self diagnosing and self medicating with food regiments and supplements. I began exercising because that was supposed to help sleep, and being in the sun was suppose to help sleep as well.\n\nSoon the only thing I wanted to do all day was exercise, lie in the sun and eat my weird diets. My fatigue subsided a bit and my focus gradually returned. But compared to the times when I taught myself how to build apps, gadgets and games this was only like 25% of back then.\n\nI decided to get blood work done.\n\nTurns out I was pre diabetic, and vitamin D deficient. After making the adjustments I then realized that I’ve been killing myself to build technology that doesn’t promote health. And for what? Money? To feel important? To feel smart? It’s just not worth it. \n\nDuring this entire phase of my life I learned that wellness and knowledge of self trumps damn near everything in this world. \n\nMy personal philosophies are in all honestly the most valuable things i’ve gained from this time. \n\nSince then i’ve revolved my life around the idea of wellness. My work is now physical and outside. I eat what my body tells me to and I do what is in alignment with my entire being. \n\nI don’t have those highs and lows, like I used to. I have a consistent peace and satisfaction. I feel as though all my goals and dreams are guaranteed and the only limiting factor is time.\n\nI’m not giving up on my goals to become a life giving entrepreneur, I just know now that rn isn’t the time. \n\nI say all this to say, better doesn’t always mean richer or smarter or more accomplished. Sometimes better just means healthier and more aligned with your own being.",

Take a couple of deep breaths (to stop the cortisol release) and come back to your poise.\n\nYou can still argue rationally, reflect on whether you might be wrong, speak your boundaries, leave without explaining yourself, or cut ties, but never betray your codex and destroy the masterpiece you have been building for so long just because your ego got hurt.\n\nNothing goes above your inner peace. Maintaining peace is not revenge, nor adapting to bad conduct. It is compassion, setting clear boundaries, applying self-defense, forgiveness, and the courage to cut ties if necessary.\n\nNo lust for fights. No imaginary arguments after a conflict. No enduring resentment. No lust for revenge.\n\nThe highest priority is maintaining your integrity and peace in order to keep your focus on the most meaningful things in your life.",

I want to become a secure person. \n\n————————————\n\nFor background, clearly I do not like who I’ve become. A lot of it is from trauma via abuse while growing up, but I refuse to live in a constant state of anxiety and negativity. I’ve moved out of that environment, but I made the mistake of manifesting it in the other aspects of my life. I figured it’d be better to explain myself in case I’m not seeing the root of the problem. \n\nI am in my mid 20’s, and I struggle with anxiety, low self-esteem, negative outlook on things, and introverted to the point of avoiding uncomfortable social situations. Usually having someone to talk to, both friends and dating remedy this. However, this anxiety and negativity has been a crux for maintaining these, which resulted in me losing them and becoming isolated. I neglected emotional fortitude and my social circle, I’m not exactly a the most pleasing person to hang out with outside of hiking and climbing.\n\nI have a strong source for physical wins. Fitness and health are actually my strongest factors. They are also a pillar for me right now, as being active and eating healthy has allowed me to do things I like to do and have evidence of some competency to improve myself. I also have the fortune of moving to a new place, so I have the opportunity to physically change my environment, one of which I hope to implement a phone-free environment to get away from doomscrolling and social media to improve my chances of success. \n\nConsidering hurdles, have problems with negative self-talk and anxiety that likely compounded downwards. I also am afraid of talking to new people outside of 1 on 1 small talk (eg. talked to a stranger about the nice view at a park I was running in recently), despite knowing I need to socialize. I am hoping that fixing these issues would consequently remedy the loneliness I am feeling and become comfortable with being alone.\n\nWith that information, how do I destroy or mold my existing person, so I can regain my sense of belonging, competency, and autonomy? \n\n",

      "selftext": "Context: currently 21, graduating university soon (next year). Not a native English speaker\n\nBack when I was in middle school, I really wanted to learn programming and become a game developer. I learned to code at 11 or 12, and started making my video games. Besides video games, I also did art, wrote music, and even learned Japanese. In other words, I've always been a highly motivated person.\n\nAnd since then, not much changed. I continue to improve my skills as a coder, I excel at other hobbies (except art I suck at art) However, something changed. I no longer feel like there is a purpose to everything I'm doing.\n\nI didn't get to be a programmer, as I was always bad at math, which prevented me from studying computer science, programming or anything similar to that. I did end up in a good university studying political science with an Asian language (I chose Japanese, since it's my hobby), which requires tons of work and dedication, but I still found time for my hobbies and interests. I'm not a nerd though, my grades are average.\n\nHowever, soon I will graduate and... Everything just kind of lost its point? I wouldn't be a programmer in the future, and I don't really want anything else. All I wanted is to be a game developer, but now I kind of have to choose something different in life. Which is fine I guess, I'm pretty apathetic when it comes to future job and stuff. If they pay me something I suppose that's good enough. I also struggled with depression for several years before that, was frequently exhausted from homework and long commuting, and honestly I feel like I just don't want anything in life anymore.\n\nI remember when I was in high school, I was set on having children in the future, achieving a wonderful career, and I, most importantly, wanted to be a better version of myself. But now I don't really feel anything like that. It's good to want to be better, but why? Who am I trying to impress? What's the goal? The closest thing I have to a goal is to make all the duties I have finally stop and let me live in peace, without bothering me all the time.\n\nAnd so I feel like I'm just floating in life, aimlessly, observing it from the side. Not even making games, or learning Japanese, or even art makes me feel that special spark that it once had. It's not that I don't enjoy it, it's just that I feel indifferent when I do that and not too excited. Think of it like, if I showed my friend my game when I was 17 and he liked it, I went \"OMG Thank you!! What did you like about it? What about the characters?\" But now if someone likes my game, all I can say is \"Thanks for playing. Glad you enjoyed it.\"\n\nIs growing apathy a sign of getting older?",

Just open the laptop and read one paragraph.\n* Too overwhelmed to write?....

It’s still there, but now it’s competing with another voice: Remember last time you ignored me? You ended up proud.\n\nSo yeah.

I use to look forward to new seasons of my favorite tv shows / sports / movies.

      "title": "If you want good habits to stick, simply reduce the friction",
      "selftext": "**Who is this for?** People that want a simple and easy way for good habits to stick and bad ones to unstick\n\n**Better life philosophy #9**\n\nOne of the things that has been key to me sticking to my good habits—and was doing for a long time without realising—was reducing the friction between me and the good habits that I wanted to stick.\n\nIt's part of human nature that—whilst it may not be in our best interest—we tend to lean towards the easiest option when making a decision. This is why we may choose to sit on the sofa watching TV over going for a run, or why we carry on playing videogames rather than meditating. We want to receive pleasure using the least amount of energy possible. In other words, we want the option that's most within our reach. \n\nThink about it like this: Would you rather sit on the bench right next to you, or the slightly nicer one 100m away? Whilst the bench beside you isn't necessarily better than the one further away, it's the distance between you and the two benches that influences your decision on which one to sit on and therefore, you end up going with the most in reach option.\n\nThis idea is backed up by James Clear in Atomic Habits when talking about how companies fight to get their products within eye level on the shelves in supermarkets. Shoppers tend to lean towards buying products within their eyesight as opposed to ones on the top or bottom shelf (regardless of how good either product is), which not only requires more effort to reach, but requires more effort to be within their eyesight in the first place.\n\nWhen I couldn't stick to working out, having to get changed, travel to the gym, wait for people to finish with the weights, travelling back home, etc all increased the friction between me and working out which ultimately lead me to be wildly inconsistent. I kept telling myself 'If it didn't feel like such a chore (because of all the things I had to do beforehand), I would stay consistent'. And so I decided to put that to the test and make it easier to workout by decreasing the friction between myself and it. \n\nI did this by buying equipment for my flat (which eliminated the factors causing friction mentioned above). I even took it a step further by investing in adjustable dumbbells to reduce the friction even more of having to continually switch the plates. Reducing the friction between me and this habit I wanted to adopt has been key to me being consistent with all my other good habits as the principle remains the same regardless of the specific habit you are trying to adopt into your paradigm. \n\nIn the same way that reducing friction between you and your good habits helps them to stick, increasing the friction helps with getting bad habits to unstick. \n\nIncreasing the distance between me and my bad habits made it a lot easier not to indulge in them. One of my best applications of this came from my desire to stop binge eating snacks. I achieved this by simply refraining from buying these kinds of foods in my weekly shop. This simple act of not buying snacks increased the friction tremendously as I put physical distance between me and this bad habit meaning that if I wanted snacks, I would have to get changed and go all the way down to the shop to get them. \n\nAs mentioned previously about humans picking the easiest option, it was easier to just not go out to get snacks as opposed to getting changed and going down to the store—It simply wasn't worth the effort for the 'reward'. \n\nSo, how do you begin to get the good habits to stick and bad ones unstick? Given the above, you need to be able to answer the following questions: 'What habit do I want to stick/unstick?' and 'How can I reduce/increase the friction between me and this particular habit?'.\n\nA simple exercise that helped me when answering these questions was to simply make a list of all the good habits that I wanted to stick. Once you have your full list of habits you want to stick, reflect upon each one and note down next to it how you can reduce the friction for that particular habit.\n\nYou can then apply this same method for the bad habits you want to unstick by making a list of all your bad habits, and then reflecting upon and noting down how you can increase the friction for each one. \n\nIf you're stuck for ways to decrease the friction, here is a simple 2 step method to decrease the friction between you and a good habit:\n\n1. Reduce the physical distance between you and that particular habit\n2. Once it's within your grasp, reduce the amount of effort it takes to indulge in that particular habit\n(see my example above with working out how I first reduced the distance by bringing the gym to me and then honing down on reducing the effort by getting adjustable dumbbells). \n\nThen for getting bad habits to unstick, simply do the opposite of the above practice: Increase the distance then increase the effort. \n\nThe good and bad thing about habits is the more you do them, the more they become a part of your paradigm, and thus automatic. When using this in the context of fixing your habits, this is beneficial since after a while you won't have to apply so much conscious effort into maintaining each and every good habit, nor will you have to keep applying  copious amounts of conscious effort in resisting the bad ones. \n\nIf you've found that you've decreased the friction as much as possible but still can't get yourself to do that particular habit, tell yourself that you'll do it for 5 minutes and then stop after that. Sure enough when I've done this myself, such as telling myself I'll do one set before stopping my workout, I find that I end up doing the thing for a lot longer than I had initially planned or end up seeing it all the way through. The simple act of getting the ball rolling makes it harder to stop as you've began to build speed and momentum for that activity. \n\nThink of it like pushing a boulder down a hill. Initially the boulder is hard to push but once you get it to roll down that hill, you need even more effort to get it to stop rolling down the hill. And more importantly, you no longer need to exert any more energy into getting it to roll.\n\nThe key thing to remember is that humans will always lean towards whichever option is easiest and requires the least amount of effort. So always look to make the good habits easy and the bad ones hard. \n\nTldr;\n\nGet good habits to stick > decrease friction\n\nGet bad habits to unstick > increase friction",

Be it learning something, exercising, eating better, yoga, quitting an addiction, journaling, and or any number of other things, today is a great day to start.  100 days just in time for the new year seems poetic.\n\nI'm not one for motivational speeches.  I myself have no business doing so due to the litany of issues I struggle with.  I don't exercise or eat right or do yoga as much as I want to.  I'm addicted to porn, I need to avoid drinking, I spend too much time on my phone, I don't dress well or get enough sleep.  I've got so much I want to fix, that I ***NEED*** to fix.  And I will, because I know that there's a future version of me screaming and begging the present day me to be better.\n\nI know that in committing to changing that 100 days from now I'll be a completely different person in my mindset, my energy levels, my health, and my zest for life; and probably some other ways I forgot to mention.\n\nI am committing to 100 days of just simply being better.  I'm 35 and I am tired of being a spectator in my own life.\n\nI encourage you to take today and figure out something that you want to be able to say on January 1st that you ended 2025 completing 100 days of doing something to improve your own life.",

      "selftext": "For the longest time, I thought the only way to beat my inner critic was to argue with it.\n\nCritic: “You’re going to fail.”\n\nMe: “No, I’m confident and capable.”\n\nBut it never worked. The louder I tried to “be positive,” the louder the critic snapped back. It was like pouring sugar on poison.\n\nSo I tried something different: instead of arguing, I treated my critic like a heckler in the crowd. I didn’t debate I just moved on with the show.\n\nHere’s the simple practice that shifted everything:\n\nCatch it: When the critic speaks up, I write it down word-for-word.\n\nLabel it: Out loud, I say: “That’s the critic, not me.”\n\nTake one true action: The smallest step I can prove real. Example:\n\nCritic says “You’re lazy.” : I stand up and put one dish in the sink.\n\nCritic says “You’ll fail at this project.”: I open the doc and type one sentence.\n\nThe critic loses power because it’s not a debate anymore. It’s evidence.\n\nAfter a few weeks, the voice went from front-row heckler to background noise. Still there, but not running the show.\n\nIf you’ve struggled with self-doubt, I’d encourage you to try the “true action” method for a week. Write down the critic’s lines, label them, and take the smallest real step anyway.\n\nAnd if you want more detail, I’ve pinned a full guide on my profile that breaks down the system I use.",

      "selftext": "I know that title sounds bad so let me explain. I’m just throwing this out there cause I’m tired of letting this get to me on the inside. I have hidden this outwardly. I usually do my best to give people what they need. I am attentive, listen, and tell people I care. Deep down I want to see people thrive. But I want to thrive to. And over the past decade or so, its almost like people don’t care I exist.\n\nMy mind almost categorizes people into archetypes I could thrive with and undesirable people who I want to avoid. I’ve done this ever since I was little. Even if a person is outwardly well-meaning, if they have some kind of obvious unattractive trait, physical or emotional, I pull away. If a person has a solid combination of traits and stuff that I like, I try my best to stay with them so I can see if it can blossom into something more. In recent years, my qualifications have gotten less picky so its not like I only look for 5 people. \n\nThe problem is, there’s almost like there’s this barrier to people. I can only get so far with the people I’m with before things stagnate. Things go a direction I don’t like or am comfortable with. Or the complete opposite: they’re never opening up and allowing me to let me into their perspective. This is frustrating to me. It makes me feel like all that effort I put into this connection feels like wasted energy. Afterwards, we either stagnate and drift away or what I like to call a “fallout”. I get emotional and call them out. They get emotional and call me out. We swear off each other. Boom onto the next person.\n\nIs it normal for human connections to be this fragile? I have honest to god seen people together throughout their entire lives, just being themselves. I know the obvious response to that is “well maybe let people into your life more.” Bitch, I have. I am just my honest to god self always and people just never gravitate toward me. I know Utah has some of the worst mental health rates in the nation and all, but this is seriously ridiculous that it’s every person over here. \n\nI know I’m going to get the “You should talk about this with a therapist” people. And to that I say, I have been in therapy for over 4 years now. Therapy isn’t fixing this. I have a clear solution, it’s just no one ever takes it. I believe that if I grew up in any other state, sure there would be more negative people, but at the very least, I could make friends and get a gf or bf much easier than this two-faced state. \n\nThis is what I mean by I want people to be what I want. Cause I’m tired of expressing myself authentically just for the same scenario to play out over and over again. I wouldn’t be saying any of this if it wasn’t what I felt deep down. I am a very authentic person who shouldn’t have to feel on the defense just for being myself. How do I overcome this? Like genuinely. I’m tired of letting the anger and frustration of every friendship ending the same way or the other person doesn’t replicate my feelings. I know this sounds spoiled or entitled, but the pain keeps happening over and over in an endless cycle. I just want to burn that cycle down.",

And that one year changed a lot inside me — but it also made me realize how much I’ve missed.\n\nNow I see girls my age who are way ahead of me. They seem clever, socially sharp, confident, and mature. Meanwhile, I’ve only been good at studying.

      "title": "My experience",
      "selftext": "A part of this text is about quit PMO, but I still sent it here, because the general idea is about my improvement and mindset.\nThis text is about my experience and my mistakes. I made the text shorter so it has less details, I wanted to add more, but it would have been a mess and nobody would read it, so I can answer anything if needed. I hope this isnt too confusing mixed with PMO, its mostly to expose here how I was before. The purpose of this text is in case anybody see this and recognize some aspects of this that he needs to improve.\n\nMy background:\nSince I was young, I procrastinated a lot, avoiding effort and wasting time on screens and video games. Since atleast 2020, I needed 5h of screens a day or else I was mad. At school, I barely did homework and never really listened. I made excuses to take the wrong path. It didn’t seem “that bad” until higher studies required real effort — then I realized how unprepared I was.\n\nI always lived like a victim in my head, blaming anxiety or my nature, but I never made a move to change. Looking back, most of it was my fault. I also slept horribly for years: staying up until 3am, waking at 7am, countless days on less than 5 hours of sleep just to play video games. There are many aspects of me I thought were just “who I was,” but now I see they were probably caused by these bad habits.\n\nI sometimes thought I was just meant to become this worse version of myself, but the reality is I downgraded. I thought many times that I was happier when I was younger, but it wasn’t nostalgia — I was happier because I was doing things (sports, hobbies). My brain always tricked me to quit, leaving me weak. So many of my experiences made me finally wake up, see clearer, and get the vision a few months ago, instead of just dreaming.\n\nStarting change & quit PMO:\nA few months ago I decided to change:\n• I quit video games.\n• I reduced “fun” screens to only the end of the day (about 30 min–2h max). So no more screen during the breakfast.\n• Then I started to quit PMO seriously.\n\nMy first streak lasted 2 weeks with mental resistance. The benefits weren’t only quit PMO — it was also my strong will to change — but quitting PMO gave me a barrier, protecting me from downfall.\n\nLater I relapsed, telling myself it was just a “test.” That week wasn’t too bad because I had hope to restart, but when I actually tried again, I lost after 2 days. That crushed my confidence. During quit PMO, small slips (like watching videos at breakfast) were easy to stop. After relapse, all my old habits came back — games, wasting time, emptiness.\n\nI downloaded a poker app “just for fun,” telling myself it wasn’t really a video game. At first it was fake money, but soon I spent real money to continue playing since I lost it all. I saw the same addictive pattern I had years ago with video games, when I spent hundreds (even thousands) on in-game items. It wasn’t just gambling — it was the same cycle of chasing progress, always wanting more, never satisfied. Eventually I deleted the app, knowing it would destroy me again.\n\nWhere I stand now:\nThis whole experience showed me:\n• Quit PMO is not the only solution, but combined with discipline, it changes my life completely.\n• Without quit PMO, I feel weak, impulsive, and easily tricked by my brain.\n\nI’ve learned the hard way that every time I relapse, I give power back to the worst version of myself. I can’t accept that anymore. Now that I experienced quit PMO, I can’t go back, because stopping proves my lack of discipline.\n\nNo more tests. No more “one last time before the good circumstances.” No more excuses. No matter how much I doubt, from today I won’t give up quit PMO.\n\nQuit PMO gave me its hand, and this time I’m taking it for real.\n\nThat’s where I’m at. Writing this took me a few hours, but I needed to be fully honest. I had to write this to remind myself what happened and to share it at the same time.",

I’ve changed my plans so many times, one is that I went from wanting to do a PhD, to not getting supervisors, to finally deciding on a Master’s in Music Therapy.\n\nI got into a university in Germany for the program, which is exciting but also nerve-wracking. I’m now waiting for my visa, and I can’t help but stress over whether it will come in time. If I miss the joining deadline, it means waiting another whole year for the next intake.\n\nOn top of that, I’m in a long-distance relationship because I had to move back home due to visa issues. It’s hard, and I feel like I’m stretched thin emotionally.\n\nEven though I have a lot of plans for a better life, I feel anxious, unmotivated, and stuck in my head. It gets foggy so soon. I shut people down, reply late, and feel like I’m constantly lagging behind. It’s exhausting trying to get out of this cycle, and I don’t feel like myself anymore.\n\nAny advice on how to get out of this headspace would mean a lot. Im looking for real answers <3",

So who am I kidding? Why should I continue trying to approach people in the context of dating? Otherwise, I have my life set and put together, I love my friends, hobbies.

That is exactly the kind of mindset trap I am trying to escape but am out of ideas and could just use other people’s perspectives and advice.  I’m trying to take more responsibility for where I’m at and what comes next but that doesn’t change where I’m at now so I apologize.  I understand this is a bit of a rant but please bear with me.\n\nBeing awake and aware that I am myself is pure psychological torture.  The person I am, my personality, the life I am leading are all toxic and somehow antithetical to who I am “supposed to be” whatever that means.\n\nI’ve seen a lot of really good advice on this sub and in other places.  “Write down the behaviors of who you want to be and gradually just incorporate them into your life” seems to be the prevailing wisdom and that makes a whole lot of sense.  My problem is, I have zero idea of who id rather be or what I’d rather be doing, all I know is what I’ve got is slowly killing me.  I’ve tried just identifying behaviors that are the “opposite” of what I do now and no amount of time or will power makes any of that become habit let alone second nature.\n\nI’m 28, I’m fat, disgusting and alone.  No amount of therapy has ever helped, no matter the modality, no matter how much time I’ve put into it.  No medication has helped.  No suggestions of how to make change have ever worked out no matter how hard I’ve tried.  I feel like I’m completely stuck and doomed to be a miserable loser but I refuse to accept that as truth.  \n\nIdeally, I’d like the person I am now to be dead to the world.  I want to be unrecognizable physically and otherwise.  A new name.  A new personality.  Natural tendencies that are the exact opposite of the ones I have now.  I want to be everything I’m not, everything being all encompassing and total, nothing excluded. \n\nI know none of this makes sense and is an emotional mess.  I guess my question at the end of the day is how can I take all of this and turn it into the plan and motivation for actual change that I can’t seem to find.\n\nI’m more than happy to expand on anything in the comments.  I’ll also delete if this doesn’t fit. \n\nTl;dr - how to take a lifetime of emotionally charged discontent and make meaningful real change when the traditional methods haven’t worked in the past.  ",

      "title": "When you’re angry or upset with someone, you’re projecting your insecurities 100% of the time",
      "selftext": "How you treat others is a projection of how you treat yourself. Which means, **if you’re judging others, that’s a reflection you’re judging yourself. Self-judgement manifests as projected anger.**\n\nBecause when you accept and appreciate yourself, then you naturally accept and appreciate others. You can only feel offended by how people treat you, if you emotionally treat yourself the same way (i.e. judge yourself). Otherwise you wouldn’t care, and continue feeling good.\n\nMost people practice what I call, **The Greatest Limiting Belief** or #1 Limiting Belief: *“I believe my emotions come from circumstances and other people. I believe my emotions come from outside of me. So, everyone else is responsible for how I feel.”*\n\nAnd that limiting belief naturally inspires **ulterior motives:** *“Since I believe circumstances and other people create my emotions, then I want to change them, and I need them to be different, so then I can feel better.”*\n\n**An argument is two people who feel powerless, projecting their insecurities and have ulterior motives.** You unknowingly use anger as a manipulation tool to be dismissive of other people's perspectives in an attempt to change them to your way of thinking, so then you can feel understood, validated and get your needs met (and that’s not a judgment; just clarity for awareness).\n\n**The only reason you want to change how they think, is because you're trying to change how you feel.** Because you believe they create your emotions. So you believe the only or most effective way for you to feel better, is they have to be different.\n\n.\n\nHow you feel is valid. Your concerns are valid. And it's great to have preferences. And, you’re also coming from a place of fear and lack; instead of love and abundance. How you feel is not because of other people (although it understandably feels that way). And continuing to believe in that illusion will keep you stuck, anxious and powerless.\n\nAnger, judgement and blame are valid. Thinking everyone is selfish or stupid, is valid. And I agree, a lot of times people are a-holes. But spending your valuable time and attention on people not worth it, won’t inspire sustainable change in your life (or others). Staying in that lower energy mindset doesn’t get you the relationships you want.\n\nYou are worthy. You deserve respect and appreciation. But you don’t allow what you want by continuing to practice outdated limiting beliefs and pointing the finger at others, instead of self-reflecting with an open heart and curiosity on how you can heal and improve.\n\nHave you ever talked with people who are bitter and resentful at the world? Yeah, it can be validating for five minutes and you probably agree. But eventually... you start feeling drained and want to gravitate towards people with a more uplifting, fun, easygoing, appreciative and playful perspective on life.\n\nAnd to clarify, you don’t have to change. You can continue to believe you’re powerless and give the power of your emotions over to other people, if you want to. **Ironically, you always have the power to choose to feel powerless.**\n\nSo you can keep judging and making other people responsible for how you feel, if you want to. Just know that that choice of **judging other people comes with a heavy price of emotional ricochet of inevitable unhappiness and self-sabotage in all areas of your life** (e.g. health, wealth, jobs and relationships).\n\n.\n\n**Anger is a natural and healthy response to feeling powerless** (i.e. not good enough, not supported, sad, rejected, afraid, etc.). The issue is when you believe you’re powerless because of other people (i.e. projection), because then that leads to an ulterior motive (e.g. arguments and seeking external validation).\n\nPeople’s behavior, and your emotions, are two completely different things (which most people believe are the same thing). Believing people create your emotions is **The False Cause Fallacy.** Their behavior doesn’t make you feel anything. Your thoughts about them creates how you feel.\n\n* When you **focus on what you want (and accept or appreciate) = You feel better.**\n* When you **focus on what you don't want (and judge or invalidate) = You feel worse.**\n\nSo whenever you feel worse (e.g. angry), it’s because you’re focusing on what you don’t want and don’t like about people. And the only reason you judge is because you feel powerless (i.e. insecure).\n\nAnd to clarify, that doesn’t condone their behavior. And you can encourage healthier behavior options (with no need the other person has to understand your perspective and receive your good intentions). And this isn’t blaming you. We’re not judging anyone here (otherwise this post would be ironic haha). This is simply an empowering reminder that you always have the freedom and ability to feel better, if you want to.\n\nWhen you give others the credit for how you feel, then you deny your power and reinforce your limiting belief that you’re powerless. And because you reinforced your limiting belief that you’re powerless, you attract more experiences where other people seemingly keep annoying and disappointing you, so you continue to mistakenly give them credit for your negative emotions, and then inevitably **feel stuck in a cycle of powerless → angry → powerless → angry.** This is a fundamental reason why our society has an abundance of people who feel sad, lonely, frustrated and judgmental.\n\n**Reaching for anger is valuable relief and a step up in how you feel and reconnecting back with who you really are.** So when someone feels angry, they were drowning (i.e. feel powerless, sad, unworthy, etc.) and are trying to come up for air. If you judge their anger, or judge your anger, then you're judging their process of relief and that they should stay underwater. You're judging their guidance, or judging your own emotional guidance as bad. But then they'll never be able to feel better and come back into love.\n\nIronically, the road to love is through anger (do it in a safe space by yourself; don't project it onto others which just keeps you stuck); it's one of multiple different supportive steps on the emotional guidance staircase.\n\nAll of this can be improved and easily avoided when you remember where emotions actually come from (i.e. your thoughts), what their purpose is (i.e. helpful guidance), and how to manage your emotions in a more practical, sustainable and effective way.\n\nWhen you focus on **accepting and appreciating your negative emotions**, then you allow yourself to feel better, and naturally allow more meaningful, fun, inspiring, satisfying and fulfilling relationships.\n\n.",

      "selftext": "35M, for 4 years I’ve been stuck in a state where life feels flat and joyless unless I rely on moderate alcohol and mood enhancing substances (legal, mostly). Despite living a normal life with long term relationship. In a sober state, I struggle with procrastination, can’t sustain focus for more than 5-10 minutes, can't stick to habits like meditation, and often avoid people, even close friends. Work obligations get done, but personal projects with long term potential remain abandoned. Sleep isn’t great, motivation is low, and I feel detached from deeper emotions or purpose. Meanwhile, whenever I start anything I have a feeling that I'm spending time on wrong thing, and I often just stay paralyzed, in maintenance mode. Most puer aeternus symptoms are there.\n\nNot looking for quick hacks, but for a book that can genuinely shift how I see myself and the world — something that could help me reconnect with meaning, discipline, or a sense of being alive. \n\nBook that I'm reading and counting on now - **Inner Work** by Jungian psychologist Robert Johnson, about connecting to subconscious through dreams and active imagination.\n\nBooks that I'm considering that might help, but not sure: \n\n* Dopamine Nation by Anna Lembke\n* Man's search for meaning by Victor Frankl\n* Stolen Focus by Johann Hari\n\nIf you’ve ever been through a similar phase and a book really made a difference for you, I’d love to hear  recommendations.",

Instead of supporting myself and saying \"good shit man that's what I'm talking about, lets buy something for myself as a reward\". I instead would say something like \" man you could have been faster so and so whose been here 10 years could do what you did easily, your not that great you have to get better\". I know negative self talk can also lead to being less confident in myself and I hate that feeling. I thought I'd come here to ask for some advice on how to go about changing the small negative aspects of myself.

I notice I am lacking boundaries and want to become more assertive in general.\n\n  \nExample: I have a problem with my flatmate but I \"am scared\" to talk to her because my brain has the embedded pattern from my childhood that whenever I vocalize my boundaries (\"Please don´t do this because it bothers me\"), the result is that I am told how I cross boundaries in many many other things (The response I get is: \"It also bothers me that you do this, this and this. You just criticize but don´t look at yourself!\"). Hence, unfortunately, I follow exactly this same pattern: Just when my flatmate tells me she has a problem with me, I use the chance to tell her the problems that I have with her.\n\nEven if I find the strength to protect my boundaries and say what is bothering me (example: \"I am taking the trash all of the time! Now you need to do it for once!\"), I start feeling guilty about what I said and I still go ahead, cross my own boundaries and do the thing...if I don´t do it I just keep feeling guilty.\n\nWould you suggest any techniques/therapy types that can help me with that? Do you thing CBT might help? Thanks!\n\n",

      "selftext": "Lately I have been noticing how most people’s entire life is built around the salary.\n\nEverything is tied to it. The roof over your head, food, bills, even a sense of safety. Take it away for just one month and most people would collapse. That dependency is scary when you think about it, but most never do. They are too distracted.\n\nThe truth is that salary has become the biggest addiction of our time. People cling to it like it is oxygen, but at the same time it keeps them trapped. And to cope with the emptiness in between, they drown themselves in distractions.\n\nBecause outside of work, what do people do? Scroll, watch shows, party on weekends, wait for the next paycheck. Work, distract, sleep, repeat. It is a cycle that keeps people calm enough to not question it. A cycle of addiction paired with distraction.\n\nThe crazy thing is that the system benefits from this. As long as people stay consumers, they will always need that paycheck. New phone, new car, new clothes, always something to spend on, and never enough left to build something for themselves.\n\nThe only real way out is when you flip from consumer to creator. Not necessarily making content online, but creating in general. Projects, skills, products, value. Something that is yours. Once you start doing that, the salary stops being your only lifeline. You can create value that others are willing to pay for, and eventually live off your own creation.\n\nIt is not easy. It takes sacrifice. You have to cut down on the same distractions that are designed to keep you stuck. But the reward is freedom. Maybe not total freedom right away, but piece by piece you start cutting the leash.\n\nI have been exploring this idea deeply and it hit me harder than expected. I even broke it down in a video recently, so if anyone is interested I can share it.",

I'm doing pretty okay now, but my job is falling apart at a time  where I really can't have uncertainty. It is also becoming draining to the point of nonstop stress. I try to tell myself it isn't the end of the world, but it's hard to say it's not when my job is teetering on the edge.\n\nI have been trying to get my own place to escape the cycle of constantly paying a landlord's mortgage, but every time I get close, the price becomes unobtainable. I have taken my dreams and have broke them down into the smallest possible increments I can tackle, and even the smallest feel monumental to overcome.\n\nIt has been years and I'm still not over a breakup. Everyone seems to move on and it seems to be a non issue for them. I honestly feel embarrassed that I'm still lingering on it today as strongly as I did when it happened. Thinking about it, I think it was a wrecking ball through a pretty core belief of mine. I'd spent my whole life being taught the harsh lesson that you can't open up to anyone. I lived by those words. Then I met a woman who, for the first time ever, I felt I could be completely open with. After 3 years she basically told me that she saw who I am in my entirety and decided I'm not good enough. Proving exactly my point again. After I had just shattered that belief because of her.\n\nThen I go to the gym to ignore the grind of the day for at least a couple of hours. Yet I'm constantly looking in the mirror and seeing a fatass look back, am constantly disappointed with where my build is, and am suffering from joint pain and back ache watching others attain what I'm after with no damage to their bodies.\n\nMy days usually consist of me in physical pain, followed by some memory or realization or nightmare of my past relationship that causes emotional pain, as I go about the job I used to love that I now hate while I don't sleep for days trying to chase a dream of escaping all of these things I hate only to realize I'm getting nowhere.\n\nBut then I see stories of people genuinely suffering. I see it internationally and think, \"That is such a tragedy. We really need to have a broader perspective.\" Then I see it happen in my country and think, \"My gosh. I can't believe that's happening. I need to be grateful for where I am.\" Then I see it happen where I am and am left thinking, \"I have no excuses. This person struggles far more than I ever will and still gets up every day.\" But then I eventually end up going back to griping over where I am, the state of the world, how hectic and busy I am, how I'm getting nowhere, and how I have no one.\n\nI have some life changing months ahead, for better or worse. How do I tell myself to shut up, acknowledge the fact that I am in a pretty good position, and make the most of what I have?",

Regardless of if I’m watching an informative YouTube videos reading an article, or listening to someone explain something to me, by the end of each I’m sitting there trying to remember what I just heard/read. A lot of time it is because I easily get caught up on a specific tidbit or simply spaced out. When it comes to the conversation side of things, I find myself constantly putting more focus into how I want to respond rather than what they’re actually saying. I do this subconsciously, and I always feel bad when it happens but I don’t even realize it’s happening until I’m doing it (as dumb as that sounds). Part of that specific topic is due to my struggle with putting my thoughts into words, as well as quickly consuming what they’re said, thinking about it, and finally putting those thoughts into words. It’s such a timely process which I believe is why I often start that process before they’re even done talking so I’m not leaving a long period of silence between when they finish talking and when I start. \n\nI apologize for this post being so jumbled, but the overall question I’m asking is how do I get to a point of effectively and efficiently consuming information? And in conversations, being able to do that, plus putting my thoughts into words without that long period of silence? As well as not letting my process of thinking about what to say cause me to miss half of what they said.\n\nThank you all so much 🙏",

I am living in a new country and have already lived in three countries before. I am a people pleaser who gets charged with having a good company and friend. Now I am living in a socially super individualistic country and I feel a bit uncomfortable with the situation that I am in. Recently started to set more boundaries and put myself first to not just sacrifice my happiness or financial status for others. I participate in activities and get to know people, make friendships, and start to evaluate them and invest in them, then boom get ghosted or I am the only one that mostly has to reach out to some of them. Of course, this situation is not with everyone but mostly the ones that I felt more near or did more than just meeting them in a cafe once a month. Feel like as more we (my partner and I) do more backlash we get.. The thing is that when we meet everything seems normal and fine but I can’t help but thinking that I don't find it normal. Like I am the one that is always on time, keeps promises, is loyal and helpful but when I need help or I am down I am on my own. Am I investing in the wrong people, or am I doing something wrong?? How should I feel about the whole situation? Thanks in advance \n",

On paper, things look good: I finished school, got a full-time offer, and even secured permanent residency. But ever since graduating a year and a half ago, I’ve been enjoying life less. The small things that used to bring me joy don’t hit the same, I’m often unsatisfied with myself, and I feel like I’ve become more rigid and drained as a person.\nThis bothers me because it’s not who I want to be. I’ve tried doing things to “fix” it, but I never fully committed. Then about 5 months ago, I hit a rough patch: I was chasing a better job (since I really dislike my current one) and got so close to an offer but was rejected. Around the same time, I was dating someone who was deeply struggling, and that combination kicked off what I can only describe as anxiety hell.\nSince then, I’ve been stuck in this loop of overthinking, blaming myself, and feeling anxious for no clear reason. I even did a hormonal test, everything came back normal, except my testosterone was on the lower side. The doctor said it’s fine, but I keep looking for things to blame. Every little stressor feels magnified, and I hate it. I miss the version of me that woke up happy, relaxed, and full of energy.\nRight now, I feel like I need some sort of “reset.” Maybe a long break, but realistically I can’t afford that. I don’t want to lose these years of my youth stuck in this cycle.\n\n\nHas anyone gone through something similar? What helped you get unstuck?\n\nI’m open to hop on some medication to “treat” myself.",

I've worked on my looks, still not nearly where I want to be but I feel like I've at least made it to the average looking range.   \n  \nI promised myself that 2026 will be the year I'll finally meet the one, but I don't really know where to meet women as an adult as I'm not in school anymore (I do college virtually), and I work in an environment where everyone is older than me because I work a job that's unusual for someone my age to have. Because of this, I guess approaching in public is probably my best shot. I've only approached twice before, first time I got the Instagram and we texted for a little bit but I could tell she wasn't interested and it went nowhere fast, and then the second time I got rejected. I have a feeling I'm probably gonna go through a couple of rejections, but realistically, I'd probably be able to get a girlfriend out of 100 approaches right?\n\nI'm hoping maybe it can also improve my social skills too as I'm horrible at starting conversations with strangers. \n\nAm I going about this the wrong way or am I on the right track?",

I became sober 6 years ago, and I can definitely say that I feel the effects of my addiction and the effects of trauma and PTSD on my brain. \n\nI started going to college 4 years ago and am about to graduate with my bachelor's. I noticed that I do often struggle, but have made mostly good grades, other than in math. I'm in a foreign language class. I have started to listen to debates in theology, philosophy, and psychology. I am learning about world history in pursuit of understanding why human beings are the way that they are. I want to learn as much as I can before I die. I struggle deeply with social interaction, depersonalization/derealization, and getting my point across. I know what I'm trying to convey in my brain, but it always seems to come out wrong. I struggle with brain fog and retaining information. I know repitition is key\n\nAnother factor is that my family members were not intelligent. They never received an education and never questioned anything they were told. They had no desire to pursue knowledge and better themselves. \n\nI believe that reading books would help me with all of these challenges, but it is quite difficult for me to focus. Does anyone have any advice to help improve brain function?\n\nEdit: I would also be interested in hearing about your personal struggles and experiences on this topic. ",

In high school, I only met one friend, who I still talk to on Discord to this day. We don't meet in the real world. \n\nI have no friends at all, I don't go out of the house at all. I'm basically in such a state that I don't even have the energy to clean up around me. \n\nWhen I gave up going out to people because of my friends and poverty, I turned to the computer at the same time. I don't know if I'm addicted to the internet, but I have the feeling that the pull of these tech companies and their algorithms has increased, and I can spend the whole day online without even going to sleep at night. \n\nI don't know what's happening to me, but where certain things motivate other people, they don't motivate me. Even when I exchanged glances for 2 years in high school with the most beautiful woman I've ever met in my life, I didn't have the motivation to start a conversation and meet up. \n\nI feel like I can't finish anything, even my driver's license, which I started 9 years ago, I abandoned, and I still haven't completed it. I literally feel like I can't do anything. Going out for a 10-minute walk around the block was the max I did in the last year. \n\nWhat's happening to me?

I just want a way (doesn’t have to be amazing) to reduce anxiety at this very moment. It doesn’t have to make me calm, I just want it to be a stop my heart from beating quickly. \n\nAnd I’m sorry if this is the wrong sub, if it is, please direct me to an appropriate sub.\n\nI don’t know why but today my anxiety has been peaking. I think it’s because my OCD, stress and overthinking has been piling up, as well as a work event I have tomorrow which I can’t stop thinking about. All of this is too much for me at this moment. \n\nIs there anything I can do right now to calm me down a bit? Like I said, it doesn’t have to liberate me of my worries, just as a way to calm me down. \n",

      "selftext": "I (18M) was just going through pics stored in google photos as I was looking for an important pic related to my dad's work. Then I accidentally scrolled as down to 2021 and 2020 and saw the pics of me and my brother (9M), being super close, hugging and smiling together. \n\nWe used to be so close, he used to be so sweet towards me, I always found him so cute and adorable (still do), but I feel in the last few years, we've drifted off. Nowadays, all interactions he has with me are either related to helping him in his school work or just fixing an error in the game he's playing on our parents'/my phone, and that's it. He very very rarely plays with me, and pushes me off whenever I go to his room to have some interaction with him.\n\nI've been going through a tough phase lately, I couldn't clear maths exam (class 12) this year, so I need to give it next year. I already face a lot of names and toxic words from my parents on a regular basis because of it (it's pretty justified imo), and he just hears them and laughs out loud and even adds fuel in the fire by saying stuff against me. He didn't used to be like that. Even when they're not saying anything to me, he just randomly says some stuff against me to make sure I get called names and he gets a laugh.\n\nHe's a pretty good student, he scores 30+ out of 35 that makes him the favorite kid of my parents (rightly so), and I'm really proud of him the way he scores such good marks since I've been an average student my entire life. \n\nI always try to protect him from my parents whenever I can, I try my best to make sure he doesn't get called names or gets scolded whenever he's struggling with a topic or did some mistake. But I feel I'm not any important to him anymore.\n\nI get that he's a kid, but still I've been struggling with stuff and all this just keeps on adding to it. \n\nI feel so paranoid these days, I don't feel good. All the time someone is trying to call me words or something like that, it's getting really hard.\n\nI've been posting such vent posts on various subs almost every second day, as I literally cannot say all this to anybody else. I'm tired genuinely. ",

Still, I have problems with those; even though I am willing to change this.\n\nOne thing that makes me very depressed is, as the title suggests, never having a relationship ever. I know I missed high school love, nearly all my so called friends are lost. I don't even attended graduation night in high school. You know why? Because I had nothing to remember at all. No friends, no activities, no memories. Even my school was not worth to remember. A private fake school which doesn't have any background.\n\nNow I am planning to improve my body, skin, teeth, my posture, mind, my purpose, meaning; I still can't get over the thought of missing out. Nearly EVERY GUY boasts with how many relationship they got in life, since age 7 or something like that; or they boast about how they are get laid every other night with different woman. It is not like this affects what I want. I'd still be happy with one relationship which contains true love and support.

      "selftext": "So basically, I’m the same age as this other celebrity (17f). A few years ago, I used to watch some of her covers on YouTube. I wish I had her trajectory and could be in her shoes. She's extremely conventionally attractive, pretty, skinny, with a cute upturned nose, doe-like eyes, a jawline like Ariana Grande, and pretty lips.\n\nShe sings better than me, and she got noticed by A-list celebrities when she was just a kid. I'm talking Justin Bieber level fame. She’s a child actress, super famous, and I wish I had that kind of life. We’re both teenagers, and I’m so jealous of her. I’ve been obsessing over this for the past six months. And I’ve been keeping up w all her stuff, a jealousy hatred obsession u could say. I also ended digging too deep and found her old stuff she posted that was weird and she was incestual and some racism posts but people don’t believe me and now they think all the photos are fake but they are real and she deleted all the stuff so I couldn’t get a screen recording. Her life is perfect. It feels like Hod sent me to let her know, right before getting announced for a big role, to wipe her socials and deny posting that weird stuff. I don’t have screen recordings either bc I thought screenshots were enough\n\nThere was this role I auditioned for, and really wanted it but my parents didn’t let me audition, and she ended up getting the role. It’s a huge deal and wil launch her career to be mega famous. I’m so jealous. I regret not being able to audition for it. and it’s not the first time since in around nov or dec 2023 there was another audition and they didn’t let me either and I’m so upset at what could’ve been.\n\nI don’t know if people here are into music like I am, but I feel like only singers would notice this: when she sings, her jaw and mouth open to the perfect amount. It’s not too big or too small.\n\nI feel ugly when I eat, my jawline is weak, and I just don’t like how I look in general. She had a supportive family who, although they didn’t grow up around music, helped her learn to sing the national anthem and other songs.\n\nMy parents are Asian and really strict about everything. They also have bad hearing, so I can’t practice singing or belt out my voice, even if I’m in another room.\n\nI’m overweight, I don’t think I’m attractive, my singing voice is mediocre, I’m average at school, and I have no love life. I just wish I had her trajectory, her life.\n\nHer parents have been recording her whole life and documenting it, sharing her talent, and helping her get into the industry. They’re genuinely supportive, not exploiting her. I know a friend of a friend who knows her family, and I’ve heard how her parents are really protective and keeping her safe, making sure she’s not exposed to harmful people.\n\nShe’s gotten advice from so many famous people, she’s so pretty, and I just WISH I could be her. I don’t like my life.\n\nAll my life, I’ve wanted to be a pop star, like Ariana Grande, thin, pretty, wanted, and everything like that. I’ve tried to find things I don’t like about her, but I can’t. She’s so photogenic, I’m not. Every angle of hers is perfect, she’s effortlessly cool, and she speaks so nicely too. She’s worked with real, famous people. Ugh, I just wish I had that life.\n\nI’ve tried to find flaws or questionable moments about her, but I can’t. I just wish I was her. SHe's kinda famous and she's always been compared to Ariana grande and hoenstly she looks it too. She has been followed and noticed by so many famous industry people She has the jawline, vocals, beauty, and everything for it to. I can already tell in the future she's going to blow up. Her songs and ideas are good too. She's been in studios with really cool and famous people and learning so much for like 5 years. I'm the same age and haven't done that at all just at home my own stuff. She has a trajectory like Sabrina Carpenter and Ariana grande. Ik people are ging to call her 'ari daughter' in the future and she might collab w her too UGH i wish that could be me. It's all I ever wanted.\n\nPlease, if anyone has any advice, I’ve been searching the internet, but my situation feels so specific, and I don’t know what to do.\n\n\n\n**TL;DR**: I’m a 17-year-old girl who’s obsessed with a celebrity my age who’s way more successful than me. She’s a child actress, a singer, and has everything I’ve ever wanted: fame, talent, beauty, and a supportive family. I feel jealous and frustrated because she’s living my dream life, and I’ve always wanted to be a pop star like Ariana Grande. I’ve auditioned for roles but my parents stopped me, and she got them instead. I feel stuck, unattractive, and talentless in comparison. I can’t stop obsessing over her success and it’s making me unhappy. I just wish I could be her and live her life. Does anyone have advice on how to stop feeling this way?",

      "title": "My life is a mess because of my parents’ decisions",
      "selftext": "I don’t even know where to start. I feel like my life has been completely derailed because of choices my parents pushed me into.\n\nI did really well in high school — 90%+, enough to get into top-100 universities in the West with scholarships. I actually wanted to go West. I researched options, made lists, imagined a proper career. But my parents never helped me properly. Instead, they focused on “saving money” and ended up making choices that ruined my chances.\n\nHere’s how it all went sideways:\n\t•\tA family friend, someone my parents always compared me and my sister to — initially wanted to study in the West. But his final year high school grades were really bad despite his parents always praising about him to my parents, so he couldn’t get into any decent universities there. Still wanting to study abroad, he chose a neighboring Asian country that isn’t even known for studies and went to an average university. He and his parents hyped the country up as a great place to study.\n\t•\tMy parents believed them completely and they ended up sending my elder sister there — she had mediocre marks and no clear plan — for a 5-year program in a field that isn’t even in demand anymore.\n\t•\tWhen it was my turn, I had top marks in highschool and real chances to go to Western universities with scholarships. Instead, my parents told me to focus on cheaper Asian universities that had “transfer programs” to the West. I found a few options, but the one they made me pick was in the same country where my sister and the family friend were already studying. Their reasoning: I could share an apartment with my sister and save money, and once she graduated, I could transfer to the West.\n\t•\tWhen my sister finally graduated, she couldn’t find a job. My parents persuaded me to stay another year, saying she would soon get hired and we could share an apartment near my uni while she commuted to work. That never happened. And then she decided to go back home since her visa expired. \n\t•\tMy sister’s degree ended up costing around $300k USD over 5 years at an average uni (Not even T200). My whole degree at my T200 uni is about $80k. With that money, I could have studied at a T100 Western uni with scholarships and far better prospects.\n\t•\tThe family friend? He ended up going back home too, because he couldn’t find a job here despite being so “talented”, “smart” and “charismatic”. \n\t•\tMy parents were obsessed with “saving money” for my education, but spent everything on my sister — who didn’t even have a plan — and now I, the only son of my family, have fewer chances to provide for the family. Meanwhile, my sister doesn’t care about her career because she has been doing an unpaid job at home for a few months. $300K USD for 5 years and she is working unpaid. \n\nAnd now here I am, entering my 3rd and final year, feeling crushed:\n\t•\tThe country isn’t set up for international students. There are almost none here, internships barely exist, and the work culture is brutal.\n\t•\tRent is insane. I’ve been paying $1,000–$1,300/month for a dorm with no kitchen and a 3-hour daily commute. I survived mostly on deliveries, and my health has suffered.\n\t•\tMy high-school friends, some with lower grades, are in T100 Western unis, doing research, landing internships, building resumes. I had to beg connections for one internship — unpaid, not even in my field. I quit after a month because it was exploitative.\n\t•\tHousing this year is even worse. Studios are $1.5k with yearly contracts while being far away from public transport. Shared apartments closed to public transport are being partitioned to cram six people into tiny partitions while still costing $1.5k . And I have been on an apartment search for a few weeks now and I still have nowhere to stay. My friends abroad pay similar amounts for proper studios and furnished 1BHKs, even in western countries which have a housing crisis like Canada or Australia. \n\nI’m still here because of the slim hope of PR. My dad is nearing retirement, and I feel pressured to “step up” for the family. But I was never given the opportunities I needed. I gave up hobbies, friends, and my own plans to follow my parents’ path, and now I’m terrified I’ll end up jobless like my sister.\n\nI care about my field and I’ll throw everything I have into these next 7 months, but honestly, I feel like it might not even matter. I worked hard my whole life and it feels wasted. I feel like a failure before I’ve even had a chance. I am feeling defeated everyday. ",

      "title": "How I created my own note taking method after months of overthinking",
      "selftext": "# My approach to note taking\n\nSo, I was overwhelmed by the amount of information I get daily as most of us are. I was forgetting things, not writing my ideas down and really struggled with time management and that kind of stuff. However, then I started discovering some books like «Building a Second Brain», «Zettlekasten method», etc. After a lot of research and reading those books, I still felt overwhelmed and that all of those methods were lacking something. \n\nSo, I decided to reset everything and create my own method with all the knowledge I had from these books and really take my note taking to the next level. In this post, I will share my personal method for note taking, which I was developing for months. It is just my experience, and I’m sharing it, in case it might be helpful to someone, because there are a lot of people strugguling with note taking and all those methods just don’t work for them. \n\n# My method\n\n**Main structure(by type)**\n\nI really struggled with the main structure, I tried everything from PARA method to Zettlekasten. But something I really missed is the simplicity of organizing the main structure how I actually wanted it to be, how it worked for me, and how I would organize it for my own needs. Now, I’m free of overthinking and will break down my method down here.\n\nMost note taking apps got some great features, which make them unique, but if we take the top 5: locking notes(security), sharing notes(collaboration), inserting collections(dashboard like experience), handwriting(with Apple Pencil usually) and quick notes(jotting something down), there will be a pattern. All these features determine the type of the note, by which I decided to organize main structure. It is NOT simple, most methods claim to be simple, but main needs to be understood and it’s quite complicated, that’s why it actually works, at least for me. So, there are 5 folders:\n\n1. *Personal* \\- jot down, quick capture, journaling, everything that needs to be quick like in Apple notes\n2. *Business* \\- dashboards, graphs, collections everything you would possibly need to organize your work like in Notion\n3. *Handwritten* \\- visual notes, drawings, sketches, something that is very messy, but easy for you to understand like in GoodNotes\n4. *Shared* \\- travel plans with your family, gift ideas for your friends, notes you need to collaborate on with someone like in EverNote\n5. *Private* \\- passwords, IDs, license keys, something you would lock with a password or FaceID like in BearNotes\n\nAll of these organize notes by type. You might find this structure confusing at first and say: «Ok, I might need to a share a dashboard from business folder, so it goes to shared, but it’s related to my business, what do I do then?» The thing is that any kind of note taking organization system got a problem: notes can overlap between folders. And the idea of my method is to separate notes into 5 categories by their type, but it doesn’t mean that every folder should have only one type of notes. You can have handwritten notes in private and also in handwritten, but in handwritten there will be most of your handwritten notes. This way, you can quickly find notes by what kind of information you’re looking for.\n\n**Top layer(by area)**\n\nSo, this is the place where most organization of your notes will happen. Main structure gives us organization by type, so it’s easier to find types of information, but this method will give us structure inside each folder, so we can organize not 50 notes, but hunderds of them. And to do it, I suggest organizing by area. \n\nArea - project, idea, interest, etc. Basically, this is something that plays some kind of role in your life. Let’s say you’re making YT videos, like to travel and take notes on books. Then, in business folder from the main structure there will be an area called YT, in personal folder travel area or if you’re traveling with someone and requires communication, then it goes to shared, and there WILL NOT be a folder called books. All your books notes will go to other areas, where they can be potentially helpful. \n\nOrganization by areas, rather than topic allows you to organize things with the question in mind where I can potentially use this information? So, instead of creating books notes folder, articles notes folder, you basically put those articles and books, where you would actually use them. For example, you read an article about IOS 26, and you make videos about tech, then you place in YT area, so you will exactly understand how you will use it. If you created an articles folder instead, you would fail to return to that information and actually make something of it. \n\n**Second layer(by actionability)**\n\nSo, as I mentioned earlier, I’ve read a book called Bulding a Second Brain, and there was a method for organizing notes there called PARA. But PARA doesn’t work as the main structure, because let’s say you are making YT videos, according to PARA your ongoing videos should be in the first folder, your collections like video ideas, which don’t have a deadline, but you use them often should go to second folder(areas), and something less actionable like completed videos or ideas you are not likely to implement, but nice to keep should go to third and forth folders(resources, and archives). \n\nAnd this seems like good organization, but in reality half of notes connected with YT will be in those folders, half in others, and if you got 10 such businesses/topics/areas whatever you call them like YT, you will have a messy structure. So, this method works, yeah, but for small amount of notes, when you got 1000+ notes, it just doesn’t work. \n\nSo, I suggest using similar structure to PARA but at the last layer, inside of areas, we talked about previously. But I modified PARA to my needs. So, you got YT area, which you placed in business, according to the previous parts of the post. Inside YT folder you got a lot of things like videos, ideas, articles, etc. How most people would organize it: videos, ideas, articles. How I organize it:\n\n*1 Active* \\- videos you are working on and articles relevant to your YT channel, which you want to read.\n\n*2 Upcoming* \\- ideas for future videos, which aren’t actionable for now, but will in the future.\n\n*3 Archive* \\- everything completed, but worth keeping as inspiration for future videos like script templates, video description template, etc. \n\n# Best practices for note taking\n\n**Choosing note taking app**\n\nAll of note taking apps got some kind of advantage over the others like Notion collections, Apple Notes simplicity, but my method organizes notes by those advantges, so you should select a note taking app, which has a little of everything. By that, I mean apps like Craft(everything from quick capturing to collections), and UpNote(great note taking app, which really got a lot of possibilities). But I don’t recommend using Notion, Apple Notes, Bear Notes, EverNote or those similar to them, which focus on one single thing, but got no balance between every kind of notes you would possibly want. \n\n **Final thoughts**\n\nIf you read this far, congrutalations, you’ll probably finally settle on this method and start taking notes. But don’t let ovethinking and these complex methods stop you from actually doing, taking notes, and making action. Analyze your needs, problems and come up how you can solve them. Stop procrasting and make the next move. \n\n*I've put a lot of effort into this post, and if it helps at least one person to organize their life, it will 100% make my day.* ",

These messages are rarely spoken in plain words; they arrive as looks, tones, punishments, or unspoken rules. A toddler does not have the power to reject them — her nervous system simply records, *“This is how survival works.”*\n\nThe tragedy is that these messages were not truths, but wounds passed forward. Fear, uncertainty, and the desperate hunger for approval were not the child’s needs — they were the unresolved burdens of the generations before her.\n\nNow, as an adult, you can see the words more clearly. You can recognize: *this was never mine to carry.* And in that recognition comes the power to stop the delivery. By naming the message, you break its invisibility. By refusing to pass it forward, you end the cycle.\n\nThis is the work of healing: not erasing the past, but exposing it to the light, and then choosing a new language — one written in safety, worth, and love.",

It is like a gap year. Something like this. I have five subjects and I only studied one and postponed four. Everyone who knows tells me what you did now. You are still in the same cycle. If you postponed the five, it would have been better for you. He says this with mockery. My family told me you will not change, you will remain as you are. I am in the last year of high school, and this year in my country is the one that will determine your future and your value in society. I am Egyptian. I was very nervous and I was afraid that the year would come and I would remain as I am and not change. I am afraid to see you again. I am afraid of being a liar. I am afraid of the looks of my cousins and relatives. I am afraid of getting a low score. My brothers Please pray for me. As I write this part, I cried and I started breathing with difficulty\n\nWhat I was afraid of happened. I accumulated lessons and did not change. I returned to some of my old habits. My family tells me every day that they knew that. They all know that I did not change. I am under a lot of pressure. I told them that their problems affect my psyche. They mock me about this matter. They tell me that I am weak and that I will not change. They tell me that my friends are better than me. They are now in university and I was afraid and sat for another year. They expect me, after all this, to study and excel. \n\nThis is one of many problems. I cannot commit. I cannot, and I do not know how to recover. How can I not be affected by their words? There are many, but I will make this my next post. \n\n",

Real progress seems to come when you loosen that grip: you can still push yourself, but you’re not chained to outcomes or validation.\n\nHave you noticed moments when letting go of control or comparison actually made you improve faster?",

Do you want to read all the books you promised yourself to read at the start of the year?\n\nThis concept of \"life lies\" I read about from a book this year completely changed my view about excuses. In simple words, when we want to avoid something we make up a 100 excuses, it is our psychological way to avoid doing a task we never really want to do in the first place.\n\nThe premise is that, it is not always because we are lazy, or because we are dumb, it is just our brains way to manipulate ourselves from actually having to do something we never want to do.\n\n Take my example, I am at an age where my peers usually start to settle in and find lucrative careers, I keep getting asked to do the same. But somewhere deep inside I knew I never was built for the 9-5 life. Yet, to distract myself I would give myself 100s of excuses to fit in, in the process I even ended up getting few jobs but as I got them I could never stick to them past a month.\n\nIn my case, my mind always kept giving me excuses to try and fit in, \"life lies\". But deep inside I knew it was not for me, so instead of delaying it, I took the brunt of it at once and quit. Now I do what I love. Write.\n\nUse your excuses to learn about yourself, they can give you powerful insights, they are not always a sign that you are lazy or inefficient.",

But if I sacrifice sleep, the next day at work is ruined; If I skip, then the guilt creeps in.  \n\nWhat’s helped a little is lowering the bar to the smallest possible version of the habit. Instead of “read 30 minutes before bed,” I’ll read two pages while waiting for my laptop to shut down. Instead of “journal daily,” I write one sentence on my commute. It doesn’t feel like much, but it gives me proof that I didn’t abandon the idea of improving myself just because work is busy.  \n\nI also noticed that the busier I get, the more I need reflection, not less. I scan the day's meeting minutes at Beyz for quick review, then find out the one thing that drained me and the one thing that gave me energy, which sounds basic, but it helped me see that not everything in my day is just “work stress” - sometimes a five-minute chat with a teammate actually gave me a boost, and sometimes endless context-switching drained me more than the long hours themselves. Self-improvement during busy seasons is more like planting small markers along the path so I don’t lose myself completely to the job, rather than the Instagram version.",

I could have been so much further by now.” Instead of feeling motivated, I end up feeling discouraged about all the time I didn’t use.\n\nNow that I’m more aware, I want to reinvent myself and start moving with more intention, confidence, and control. But part of me worries: is it too late at 23 to truly reshape how people see me, and to make up for the time I feel I’ve wasted?\n\nHas anyone here gone through this kind of reinvention? How do you deal with regret over the past while trying to take control of the present?\n\nI would like to add that I also suffer from OCD, and one of my worries is to obsess over my image and reputation or whether people like me or not",

I had a full-time job offer earlier but declined since it wasn’t aligned with my interests, even though the pay was good. Now both my parents are retired, finances are tighter, and I sometimes regret that decision.\n\nSince moving back to my hometown, I’ve been feeling stuck. At first it was nice, but now the city feels dull, I procrastinate, and I miss the independence I had during university. Living with my parents 24/7 has also been challenging. My mom in particular can be a bit controlling — for example, she comments (sometimes just with her expressions) on what I wear, which makes me second-guess myself. I love her, but it feels like I’ve lost the freedom to make my own choices.\n\nThey’re also very protective. Recently my friends planned a trip, and even though I said I’d skip the clubs, avoid drinking, and return early, my parents still said no to me staying in a hotel or going alone. I’m in my 20s and want to show them I can make safe, responsible choices. I know they act out of love, but I also know I need to grow, become more independent, and rebuild my confidence.\n\nHow can I improve myself in this situation?",

I took one of those little habit tracker apps and just started trying to do those things every day. I started exercising so I felt less bad about my body, drawing since I've always wanted to draw, I started journaling, I even started practicing Greek on LangaugeTransfer (which, admittedly, started just out of boredom and wanting to try something novel, but it's developed into a genuine interest). And throughout the entire summer, I did these things with only occasional slip-ups, and it felt great, I felt great. Because previously I had been... in a certain state of mind, in which I had deluded myself into believing I couldn't improve, and I had pretty much just proven that idea wrong.\n\nHowever, recently (where I live at least), school started and has been in for about a month now. While at first I was able to maintain my habits somewhat, the amount of homework I got from certain classes (including an honors AP class that I ended up leaving because it was FAR too much, even for what I had expected, to the extent I was having genuine difficulties managing it), combined with a sudden, short fever that still managed to leave me with quite a bit of make-up work, and I just... stopped my habits. I occasionally manage to get some exercise every now and then (on good days, for reference, it's about what I was doing before at 50 pushups 60 squats and 100 crunches. Sometimes it's just a bare minimum of like 25 pushups and 50 crunches though), but pretty much every day after the aforementioned fever I've just not had any of the willpower or motivation to do things like drawing or the Greek lessons. I'll tell myself all day in school, \"When I get home, once I pack everything away, I'll do (exercise, drawing, Greek, etc),\" but when I get home I just... sit around, play video games, whatever.\n\nIt's genuinely been a mental stress to me, because doing those habits over the summer made me feel \"normal\", as in I started to feel good about myself and my capabilities. But now that I can hardly manage to make myself do a single pushup or drawing at times, I've just felt stressed. Idk, maybe I'm just a dumb kid with just bad willpower or something. Any and all advice is so genuinely appreciated.",

I find lust as a great enemy, wjen I get the urges, I fight off for a bit but then after a couple of minutes later the lust consumes me. But I don't always fail, tho sometimes I just try to ignore the lust but some days, the urges feel strong, like today, and I find myself trapped in this loophole. I think if I got rid of my lust, I could focus on working on other things such as anger, kindness, happiness, peacefulness",

We broke up but we’re still talking and trying to make things work. 6 months ago I found out she slept with someone she was talking to for a few days before while still living with me. This really messed me up. I thought we can work on things and figure it out till then. She was the only real friend I had and it kinda destroyed me. I couldn’t believe she would betray me in this way while still living with me. I don’t know anyone here and work a job I hate and pays little. I don’t have much experience with other work fields and have no one to talk to. My coworkers aren’t too similar to me to make friends with and I work a schedule where I need to be asleep by 7pm which makes going out very difficult for me. I feel so lost and don’t know what to do anymore. I feel like such a looser and don’t really have interest anymore. It’s hard for me to socialize due to anxiety and constantly not feeling good enough for anyone. I started therapy a week ago and have been eating better and working out often but don’t know what to do to make my life better. Any suggestions on things to make my life better? Most days I don’t do much besides being on social media and working out. ",

      "selftext": "\nHey everyone, figured I’d circle back and give an update since my last post in r/Askmenadvice got way more responses than I expected. I really appreciated all the comments and advice, so thank you again for taking the time.\n\nSince then, a few things have shifted. I managed to land a hospitality job — nothing glamorous, but it pays okay and gives me some stability while I figure out where I’m headed long-term. It’s not exactly what I went to school for, but honestly it feels good just to have something steady after all the uncertainty. Mentally, I’d say I’m in a better place than before. I still have anxious days, but overall I feel a bit more grounded than when I first posted.\n\nDating, though, is still tricky. I’ve had a couple experiences where I was ghosted after days of really engaging conversations, and a few times where dates flaked at the last minute. I know that’s just part of modern dating, but it definitely stings when it happens repeatedly. I find myself questioning if I said something wrong or if I’m just not enough, which I know isn’t the healthiest mindset. I’m working on not internalizing it so much, but I’d be lying if I said it doesn’t knock my confidence.\n\nAt the same time, I’m trying to keep perspective. I realize I can’t control whether someone follows through or not, only how I respond and how I carry myself. Right now, that means focusing on building my self-esteem where I’m at  and being more comfortable with who I am, even if I’m not “fully established” yet. Some days I manage that better than others, but it feels like progress compared to where I was.\n\nI think what I’m learning is that this is a process, both with dating and with myself. I can’t rush it, but I also don’t want to close myself off completely. So for now, I’m just trying to balance putting myself out there with not letting setbacks define how I see myself.\n\nQuestion for anyone reading: how do you handle being ghosted or flaked on without it wrecking your confidence? Any tips for bouncing back and not taking it so personally? \n",

      "selftext": "Hello everyone. \n\nI'm 23F. I had gone to one of the top three universities in my country and messed up. Now after peeling myself off the ground, I'm currently studying at a different \"normal\" university. \n\nI graduate in two years with a bsc in maths and stats. But I can't help but feel like it's all pointless. Ridiculous even. \n\nThe job market is trash and there's a chance of being unemployed for a period of time. Could be Years. My current environment isn't the best and although I have a good mental capacity, I find myself slipping into dark places for some time after a while. I stay there for 2 days at maximum,  but during that time I'm highly tempted to meet God.\n\nDuring the years I spent being a failure, I improved a lot as a person and I'm much more stable now. It was a learning experience that will serve me greatly in future. I had been depressed for about 3 years. After I won against the void, it's very hard to allow myself to wallow for a long time because I trust myself to pull me out of it. But the reality of the world is makes me feel hopeless despite my ambition. \n\n I rarely waver. I only thing that gets me sometimes is that I'm probably working so hard for no reason. \n\nHow do I stay sane? \nAlso anyone who's willing to share their stories?\n\n",

      "selftext": "When we talk about growth, whether personal, professional, or organizational, it always comes back to one thing: clarity of purpose. \n\nA team with a clear direction can move mountains, while one without it often struggles even with the simplest tasks.\n\nBut clarity alone is not enough. \n\nWhat truly makes a difference is the right guidance and support at the right time. Sometimes, all it takes is a nudge, a new perspective, or a mentor who helps you see the bigger picture. \n\nThat’s what keeps people focused on their goals even when challenges arise.\n\nHere are a few principles I believe every leader and team should reflect on:\n\n>Think in Solutions, Not Just Problems – It’s easy to point out what’s wrong, but progress comes when we ask: “What can we do differently?”\n> Define Requirements Clearly – Ambiguity kills momentum. Clear expectations create accountability.\n> Encourage Broader Thinking – Innovation often comes from asking: “What else could be possible?”\n> Provide the Right Support System – No one achieves greatness alone. Guidance, feedback, and encouragement fuel resilience.\n> Revisit and Realign Goals – Stay adaptable, but never lose sight of the vision.\n\nAt the heart of it, strong teams aren’t just built on tools or processes; they’re built on trust, shared clarity, and the belief that growth is a journey, not a destination.\n\nQuestion for you:\nWhat do you think matters more for long-term success; having the perfect plan or having the right guidance along the way?\n\n#Leadership #Teamwork #GrowthMindset #BusinessStrategy #PerformanceExcellence #Clarity #Guidance #TeamSuccess",

Made thousands of dollars but I built a reputation online for the work and also claimed it all as my own as WE both agreed. It’s not a good thing I know but it was something I agreed to. During the years we did this they would dissapear on work they were paid to do and leave me to deal with angry customers since it was my online presence not theirs so I eventually cut off the business and continued solo. After that I’ll feel bad and send them some work to do and it was the same thing of them disappearing on work and delivering extra late. Fast forward to more recent they came and exposed everything and made it all look like it was all me  and also claiming both mine and their work they did and it looks like I tried to silence a small creator when it was shady business turned sour because I stopped paying money to them. Their post has gotten 50k views and all support but my side and truth only got 7k views and no one is really coming to look at it. It’s also hard because I just got a new phone and deleted most things from me and their conversations but I showed proof and difference and our work and no one cares to hear both sides. I’ve admitted my wrongdoings and apologized to my community but all the heat is my way which I do deserve but it sucks. They say internet is not a real place but it’s how I make money and although I didn’t lose a lot of support because it’s only one community out of the multiple I am in I still feel the shame from it all.

He is trying really hard to cheer me up lately, even staying on the phone for hours well i vent, and cry a couple weeks ago. \n\nI guess it set him off that I let someone hurt me because, I kept everything to myself for about a year. \n\nHe said he wants to actually date me, so it makes me happy.

I tend to forget my family calls me the most oblivious when it comes to guys who actually like me.\n\nAlso reached out to my ex a few days ago for the first time. We had lunch, talked things out and determined to just be friends. This is because he is so heavily involved with my siblings, I can’t keep ignoring my dad’s house because my dad health has been rapidly declining lately.  And we have always just been better friends. Also have known him since we were 11 and our families still talk to one another. And yes, my friend that asked me out does know about this lunch, he was the one to encourage it actually. \n\nAlthough my heart is shattered, my mind is motivated. \n\nEdit: I ended up deleting both accounts instead of deactivating.

      "selftext": "Greetings.\n\nLast year I've started the journey of improving my life. I've had to make a series of major choices that hopefully will shape my future for the better. Since I was little I loved playing computer games. I always considered this a core part of my identity as a person and for some time I embodied it to the extreme. High school was a rough period for me, I was constantly unhappy, having negative thoughts, so I used to play video games for 10hrs+ per day as a source of escapism from the day to day life, to the point where it started affecting my grades. At some point I've realized that it's hurting me and my future, but I just couldn't stop, at least until last year when I thought that video games shouldn't be a part of my future self. In the past I've tried to reduce the time from 10 to 5hrs or even less, it worked for a while, but then I slowly returned to the old habit. 3 months ago, I decided to quit cold turkey this time and it was a success until lately. Nowadays I miss playing video games and I feel like I'm slowly losing this part of my identity while trying to change, so I started playing again for a few hours every few days.\n\nThe problem is that now whenever I do it, I feel guilty of doing it, I feel like this is not helping me at all improving and I should do something productive, but at the same time I don't want to lose myself while changing. I know that I'm doing it more responsibly now, but I'm wondering if this feeling of guilt is occurring, because in the past I took it to the extreme and it affected me negatively and now I'm still associating playing video games with the negative impact it had on my life back then or that I used to play them when I was at a low point in my life even though I'm doing better now than when I used to binge play video games.\n\nSo, what does one do when he wonders at what point to stop, as continued change risks losing thyself in the process?",

      "title": "I get critiqued then asked to be more confident: I don't get it",
      "selftext": "Hi all, 24F here, I know I am taking a simple topic and thinking about it too hard, but I have a really hard time with understanding what people mean when they ask me to have more self-esteem.\n\nTo start I think I am beautiful, I work extremely hard, I am smart, and I am a good person. However, I know I am not going to win a beauty pageant, work and school do not come naturally to me: it requires a lot of effort, and sometimes I can be selfish and overreact. All true at the same time. Self awareness.\n\nI recently started my first salaried job. During onboarding I was nervous during a presentation I tripped over my words and when the team went to give me critique, I offered a disclaimer about how my presentation right then wasn't strong- being self aware. I was given the advice to be kinder to myself. Then critiqued on the presentation.\n\nOthers can criticize me but I can't criticize myself? I have to be kind to myself but you're not kind to me? And why should I self-affirm efforts and actions you just told me I shouldn't? This is one of many situations that has gone similarly and I can expand into other environments as well, not just work:\n\n* I am insecure with romance because I think I am emotionally unstable and don't have the energy to pour love into another person. I don't want to go into dating thinking I'm this catch because that's not true, I'm not perfect! No one is! I recognize I need more confidence going into dating but the reality is that I don't deserve that kind of attention if I don't have the energy to return it: I am just being self aware.\n* Friends: I think I am a good friend and think about the needs of my loved ones a lot. I have friendships that have lasted me since Kindergarten and we speak every single day. However I have fucked up with friendships before: saying something rude when I was drunk/ highly emotional, or I try to make plans with new people and get \"I might be busy\" in return. I have had friends cut me off, angrily. I can't walk around promising people a good friend when people exist that literally tried being my friend and don't want to anymore.\n* School!!!!!: I am graduated from college but would constantly be told that I need to have more confidence regarding my school work (artwork, art degree). However, it would be graded poorly based on valid technical errors. Am I supposed to be confident in incorrect skills/ answers?\n\n!: I never put blame on the people criticizing: I know I shouldn't be emotional at work, I know I need to handle what I drink, I know I should pay attention to detail next time. I just get confused when I implement feedback, come back with my best effort *but nervously* because the first time was *also my best effort* and *wrong*, and then I get in trouble! For more best effort AND for being nervous about it!\n\nI just don't get it. I am confident in the sense that I am not SHY: I speak my mind, always. I know who I am. I am f-ing hilarious, I care deeply about literally everything, I have a hot body and I am a talented artist. There is a quote that 'we are harsher critiques of ourselves than anyone else' is, but genuinely I don't feel like that is true because every time I feel sure of myself some sort of critique comes in and knocks the feeling down. It feels like a flag waving \"your choices are wrong, your intuition is wrong, your efforts are wrong, **your perception of yourself is wrong**\".\n\nI know I shouldn't care what people think, but I need my bosses to like me so I can have a job and eat, I need friends to like me because that's the point of a friend, I can't date someone who isn't attracted to me, and I can't be a 3D artist if the files aren't technically correct. What people think of you is how basic connection works, and other people are the only reason we do stuff like get dressed and speak languages. And if I get fired, lose friends, get broken up with, I am going to end up alone and that scares me.\n\nI am working on myself in so many ways. When I try to explain that to the world, the world is like \"BTW THAT'S BROKEN AF!!!!\". Then wonder why I think I need fixing.\n\nSo like... I know where my mindset is wrong and at this rate I won't be confident until I stop getting critiqued (which will never happen). And I use what others dislike about me to learn how to dislike myself (toxic).\n\nBut how else am I supposed get better as person and be self-aware if I'm only supposed to believe the critiques secretly and also not care what others think?\n\nHow do I flip this or break it down more?",

Perhaps you've tried years and years of medications and none have really worked, or they have their own debilitating side effects. That is a 'will', but it doesn't always pave a 'way.' \n\nWhat are some other phrases, mantra's, sayings, or 'words of wisdom' that you've found flawed or unhealthy?",

Give it your own meaning and enter into self improvement authentically.\n\n",

I never seem to build muscle memory?  Is that possible?\n\nI've drawn for almost 40 years. And I have a comic I've drawn for 27 years and the character has never looked the same once. Ever. \n\nI was on a bowling league for three years. My friends on the team all improved their scores. My average stayed the same or worse the entire three years.\n\nI've tried picking up multiple instruments. Practice scales and chords. And even after like 2 years I couldn't hit a single chord correctly... So I gave up and I hate myself for not sticking with it.\n\nRecently ive picked up disc golf... Because lack of hobbies I stick with has left me pretty overweight. And I'm trying to be good dad now. And you know be healthy.  Ear better etc etc \n\nAnyways I bought a basket for the backyard on father's day. And I have practiced every single day for anywhere between 30 min to 2 hours. It's the most effort I've put into anything in ages.  Ive maybe missed like 3 days total. I've tried different putt styles. Watched videos. Over and over  Literally walk around my house doing the arm movements trying to build up some ability. And I haven't gotten better. I'm trying so hard for this not to be another lost hobby.  I just want to see like a small sense of consistency. But basically every time I go to throw Its like I have no idea how I moved what I did. Can't recreate it. I've taken videos of myself. I say out loud what I'm doing each time. And it feels like I've never done it before every time. \n\nI went to the course the other day with a friend who has never went. And he beat me. Literally tried 2-3 times and he had a throw down. Nothing major. But consistent enough to beat me. \n\nSo is there a mental block. A trick or tip anything from anyone with similar issues? I have some depression and ADHD.... Diagnosed anyways. Oh meds for it. Nothing really seems to help there.\n\nI feel like some of my ADHD and depression come from not being able to feel like a complete human. Just play warcraft and work. And raise my kid of course.  But maybe it's a vicious cycle depression it hard, then failing makes depression worse? \n\nMaybe it's simpler than that. Who knows just reaching out as I'm 41 this month. And I feel like shit.... It's all downhill from here. And I've just kinda floated through life not doing anything. Tired of going to gatherings and when people ask \"what do you do\" and feeling embarrassed.\n\nThanks for anyone who reads/replies. Sorry for the rant. ",

      "selftext": "[Background]\n\nI'm disabled and very poor. A year ago, I was homeless and living between a tent and hospitals. I now live in a very messy home that needs a lot of fixing up. I have very little luxuries, and my main sources of entertainment are nature walks, roller skating, and listening to music. My physical disabilities are fibromyalgia and Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, two conditions which cause a lot of pain. EDS makes people particularly flexible, which means I have to take extra care of my muscles and joints, so I have to work harder than most to learn about being healthy and muscle care.\n\nI used to weigh 285lbs and am now at 197 at 5'1\". I'm planning to get down to a US size 5/small with no specific weight goal since muscle will weigh more than the 110lbs I've always dreamed of.\n\nAs for my face, I'm okay. I'm not Instagram pretty, I'm kinda mid. You don't see a lot of youtubers who are actually fat and regular making content about how things transformed them. \n\n[Channel Idea]\n\nSo, for my channel, I kind of want to do a lifestyle overhaul. I want to showcase my home improvement, my health improvement, and aesthetics improvement. I'd like to share what routines I'm following that work and that didn't. I'd like to share tasty, healthy recipes I come up with. \n\nAs I get more money, the quality of what I can make will also improve, as will my access to opportunities and challenges, so the audience will feel like they're growing with me and really part of the journey. \n\nDoes this seem like something anyone would watch? How long should these videos be? Like, 10 minutes or 20? I feel like only beautiful people with all the fancy lighting and high quality cameras can keep attention for long... \n\nAnyway, any thoughts? ",

Initiating convos is so uncomfortable I have nothing to say?\n\nSo Im in a 2 year degree program at my college and we are 3 weeks in. I have lecture once a week where I sit alone and lab once a week where im in a group for part of it. I try to initiate convos and even try to take it outside of class to build relationships with these people because these are the same people I will be seeing for the next 2 years in school.\n\n Ive gone through a whole bachelors degree and made no friends.\n\n However with this program I feel like those around me are more relatable and in the same stage of life as me. Kids, similar age, similar goals so im really trying to make an effort. Everyone seems to effortlessly connect. Im not sure what anyone talks about? \n\nDuring our first 2 weeks of lab I initiated starting a group chat and got my groups numbers. I tried to plan a study group for the exam but they were either busy or didnt want to. Understandable cause im not to into study groups either I just figured it was a good way to connect outside of class.\n\nToday we had a test none of us previously know eachother but some have already clicked. They grouped after the test and started talking about it. So awkwardly I try to join in and it went well. We ended up breaking off walking back to the parking lot it ended up being me and 1 other which we both seemed to struggle keeping the convo going? \n\nObviously we do the whole small talk thing, but I guess where I get lost is taking the convo further? How do you turn simple conversation about class into friendship? 😂 I dont want to sound crazy im not expecting to make bffs with everyone I just struggle with being awkward and opening up with with the basic class convos? So anyways im looking for tips/ advice? I dont want to be like this anymore lol. As you have read it am currently actively making an effort.",

      "selftext": "Hi Everyone,\nFor many years I have been struggling at work that is resulting in lot of doubts and questions about myself. I have tried to change jobs - 4 times in the last 10 years — blaming the work culture but the story has been the same. This is leading me to think that something must change within me or the way I work but I do not how. I work in Product Management in Tech and it has been always tiring, doubting and struggling. Almost of it involves dealing with people. As my job requires lot of people collaboration, it is hurting my mental health and confidence. I recently wrote down what I struggle with most (not exhaustive — just what came top of my mind) — would be helpful to know how get started with improvements. Here is that list:\n\n1. Never able to assign work to anyone else — all the work somehow comes to me leading to increased workload & sense of frustration that I was not able to assign the work & it went exactly reverse \n2. Not able to delegate the work to anyone else — almost always no one is willing to take up what I want to offload — leading to more work with no impact\n3. Everyone around me tries to overpower me and think it is easy — making every collaboration far more difficult\n4. Communication all the time is very tiring — not interested in writing big updates all the time just to keep stakeholders aligned or updated\n5. There is a lot of friction and resistance on any of my proposals — but do not see any resistance for others that are way below my quality\n6. Cannot highlight or explain the issues I am facing to others — always feels like a lot of work just to express it. Face difficulties in articulating what issues I am facing and where I need help\n7. Whenever I eventually tell my manager or others of my problem, it always sound like trivial — but internally I am always feeling it huge and get disappointed again that I was not able to explain it properly leading to not doing it the next time\n\nAs I said these are just a few and would appreciate where to start for help or improvement.
