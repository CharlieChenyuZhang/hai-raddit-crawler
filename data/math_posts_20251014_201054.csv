1o64mqf,Python Pygame or C++ OpenGL for math simulations?,"So I've been coding for almost 9 years now, and I'd say I'm really good at it, I understand a lot of things. I'm still learning as a self-taught developer, and right now I'm in college studying math (actuarial sciences) because I genuinely love it. The thing is, I love implementing math algorithms as a hobby, reading papers, understanding them, and then simulating or creating stuff with them.

But I'm stuck between Python with Pygame and C++. I've used both and they're both great. I know C++ is faster, but Python's faster to develop in. Here's my problem though: when I use Python, I get this FOMO about not using C++ and OpenGL, because I'd really like to say I implemented something from scratch. But then when I switch to C++, I'm constantly thinking I'd be way faster doing it in Python. These are just basement projects that I genuinely enjoy, and I know there's probably something weird about this feeling, but I can't shake it.

He told me to prove a very short lemma which i could see the proof. It was very basic but just after a while he came to me and told me how to do the proof. Now i am thinking like is it the case that he trusts me soo little that he can not even trust me with a short proof and he had to solve for it.

1o5n3gm,Answer to a longstanding question of Nash on resolution of singularities,"Hironaka showed that every variety over the complex numbers possesses a resolution of singularities, but his procedure for producing one is highly non-canonical and does not work in positive characteristic, suggesting the very natural question as to whether or not a more canonical construction could be found, ideally working in all characteristics. John Nash suggested a possible construction, nowadays known as the *Nash blow-up.*

A team of mathematicians from Chile and Mexico has recently given examples of toric varieties which are their own Nash blowups, thus showing that Nash's suggestion does not work in general. The paper will appear in Annals of Mathematics. The preprint is available here:

The point that motivated this post is that, on one hand, being an independent study, I don't need to worry about deadlines, exams, or other work. The pacing is all mine to decide. On the other hand, the lack of outside pressure also means the lack of outside motivators, so it relies solely on me to keep the ""game going"".

1o4p5w7,Mental maths,"Edit- I just realised I put maths instead of MATH and that’s irking me so thought I would correct myself 

I’m 20F and every month I set myself a challenge, this month it’s improving my math skills. The highest level I took it at was UK GCSEs I just about achieved a 7 with the highest being a 9 equivalent to a low A, one mark off a B (6). 

A decent score but I wouldn’t say I’m particularly good at it, instead I would just listen in class enough to comprehend it, I believe anyone can do well in GCSE math if you pay enough attention. 

I am wondering what the limits are for mental math for the average person. When it comes to mental math I can work out any number 1 through 10 times any number which I know is beyond basic. Say 4 x 433 would take me maybe one minute. The way I would do it is 4 x 400 1600. 4 x 30 120. 4 x 3 12. Add those together, is there any little tricks to shorten this I’m curious, I doubt there is but who knows I know I have no clue, I feel like there are people who could work that out in 2 seconds. Then we have a bit of a harder one like 0.96 x 6 again I can do it this time I might need some pen and paper though. I know this is probably ridiculous to you mathematicians out there lmao.

And I noticed rather a negative impact on my studies from AI. The problem is that I often take the easy way out (whether it be problems I choose myself or online qualifying of olympiads). I ask some help or an answer from an AI ( might be hints to solution, might be answer or full solution ). But I realized that studying mathematics (this is probably not entirely about uni math, rather problem solving skills ) is like a video game where you have to constantly grind to level up. If it’s easy — go further. You can’t lose, you have thousands of problems available. And there is only a HARD way to do it. Problems should be hard and I should struggle to grow. I need to pass this phase, sometimes should be exposed to failure. It’s normal to come back to the problem after mutliple days or even weeks. But I try to fool myself, try to cheat in order to avoid this irritation.  
I know that it’s just my choice to use it and that AI is kinda stupid when it comes to hard problems. I heard “it depends on how you use it, smart people can just optimise processes and become smarter”. But man, I don’t really need two options. It’s tough to make yourself go the harder way.

The things I noticed is that this classic ZFC-stuff seems not really computational friendly, and most computer theorem provers are based on other foundations that look more like functional programming. Also I found that, while virtually anything can be interpreted with the help of sets and ZFC, it's pretty hard to rephrase theorems into a formal ZFC setting. For example, let's say I want to formally prove that in a loopless undirected graph the sum of degrees of all vertices equals 2 times the number of its edges. The mere definition of what is ""the degree of a vertex"" or ""the numbers of a graph's edges"" as a FOL-formula, while possible, seems excruciatingly difficult.

So I wonder what are the other foundations to look at, for more practical purposes. I also wonder if my thoughts about classic ZFC being too ""pure mathematical"" and ""disconnected from computations"" actually make any sense.

1o38thg,"Are there any books or resources that collect interesting or ""creative"" mistakes students make when learning new concepts?","When people learn a new concept for the first time, they often make mistakes or misunderstand something.

I’m curious if there are any books, articles, or online sources that collect these kinds of mistakes  not just to laugh at them, but to study them, understand *why* they happen, and how they can be used to explain concepts more clearly.

1o2ov0z,Can the “intuitive” proof of the isoperimetric inequality be made rigorous?,"The isoperimetric inequality states that of all closed planar curves with a given circumference, the circle has the largest area. In textbooks, this is usually proven using Fourier analysis.

But there is also a commonly given informal proof that makes the result relatively obvious: The area of a nonconvex curve can be increased without changing the circumference by folding the nonconvex parts outwards, and the area of an oblong curve can be increased by squashing it to be more “round”. In the limit, iterating these two operations approaches a circle.

My question is: Can this intuitive but informal insight be turned into a rigorous proof?

1o2fupv,Math appreciation,"I’m a senior undergrad doing math and physics. I came in as Astro and quickly realized it wasn’t what I was looking for and switched to physics. When I took my 2nd upper division classical mechanics course I found myself going down many rabbit holes and thinking about things never addressed in my physics classes. I took a proof based math class and fell in love, so I added a math major. Now I’ve done 3 semesters of analysis and a semester of abstract algebra and I can’t stop. Next will be Galois theory and differential geometry, followed by topology. 

Coming from physics, I was always very reliant on visualization techniques and physical intuition. Getting past the wall of abstraction in math was hard for me and I’m still learning so much all the time but man I just love it so much.

1o1rtg0,Question for math lovers: Why do you think other people experience math anxiety?,"Hi, recently I have been working on a study involving math anxiety, a topic I have been curious about for quite some time now. In the field of psychology, it is actually pretty well documented, but I personally have never experienced it so I have no way of truly understanding it in its entirety. 

The first time I witnessed math anxiety was when two of my friends genuinely freaked out over an upcoming math test. I had watched them study for it weeks in advance and I even helped out. They are in Algebra 2 (we are high school age) while I am in AP Calculus and have an insane love for algebra. 

They are really smart people and truly care about their grades but they made the test seem like the world was going to end. I thought they were going to explode. I could in no way relate to what they were feeling.

I looked through older posts on the subreddit about math anxiety but they were all from the perspective of someone who experiences it. I have not only talked to my friends but other people who also dread math class/tests. I also talked to people who feel the opposite and they agree with me they cannot relate.

I want to hear from people who have experienced more than me, and are on the same side of the coin I am. Why do you think it happens? Not only at the high school and college level but past that.

For clarity, the anxiety I am talking about is not simply OCD or the fear of getting a question wrong or looking stupid, I mean oppressive anxiety that makes your hands shake and heart pound. The anxiety that no matter how prepared you are, it will still be there and hinder your performance.

I was just sitting there, doing nothing, so I decided to attend a lecture mostly because I was bored. It turned out to be a calculus lecture, one that I had finished a long time ago.

I was surprised by how I never realized before that calculus is actually so simple, so elegant, so beautiful. There was no complication everything just seemed so straightforward and natural. The professor was, like, “proving” the Intermediate Value Theorem just by drawing it, and it really hit me how I missed when things were that simple.

While I was sitting through that lecture, I was honestly in awe the whole time. The way everything fit together just some basic formulas and a few graphs on the side it all felt coherent, smooth, perfectly natural and elegant in its simplicity. Not like the complicated stuff I have to deal with now, where I have to do real, detailed proofs.

It just made me realize how much I miss that simplicity.

1o0zcw0,Wanted: A nontrivial Lebesgue integral,"My uni days are long behind me, but I distinctly remember the Lebesgue integral being the biggest disappointment for me in analysis.

There’s this amazing machinery of measure theory, built up over weeks, culminating in the introduction of an entire new integral concept that is a true generalization of the standard integral. Armed with the Lebesgue integral, we can now integrate things like the indicator function of the rationals!

Whose integral turns out to be zero. Which I would have guessed without ever hearing about the Lebesgue integral, or even its underlying measure. It’s just the only value that makes any sense, given that the rationals are countable. It’s also just a restatement of the fact that any set of rational numbers has Lebesgue measure zero.

There were a few more examples in the textbook, but they all had this “well, duh!” flavor to them. The lecture quickly moved on, and so did I, and that was the end of my love affair with the Lebesgue integral.

So today I am asking, can my initial infatuation be rekindled? Is there an example of a function that is Lebesgue integrable but not standard integrable, and whose integral is **not** immediately obvious from the function and some basic facts about the Lebesgue measure?

1nzulhh,Making math more accessible,"This is coming from someone who has publications in math journals. One of my professors told me that math is democratic because everyone can contribute. I have learned that this is not the case. Some reasons are

1. Books are often unreasonably expensive in math and out of print.

examples:

Rudin, Principles of Mathematical Analysis

Borevich and Shafarevich, Number Theory

Carter, Simple Groups of Lie Type

Platonov and Rapinchuk, Algebraic Groups and Number Theory

Ahlfors, Complex Analysis

Griffiths and Harris

Conference proceedings are hard to get a hold of.

2. In research, to make contributions you have to be ""in the know"" and this requires going to conferences and being in a certain circle of researchers in the area.

3.Research papers are often incomprehensible even to people who work in the field and only make sense to the author or referee. Try writing a paper on the Langlands program as an outsider.

Another example: Try to learn what ""Fontaine-Messing theory"" is. I challenge you.

Here is an example of a paper [https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.04013](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.04013)

Try to understand it

4. Many papers are in German.

edit to add:

5. A career in math research is only viable for people who are well-off. That's because of the instability of pursuing math research. A PhD is very expensive relatively speaking because of the poor pay (in most places).

I’ve been studying the Pumping Lemma in my automata theory class, and I got a bit confused about what it really means to “consider *all possible decompositions*” of a string `w = xyz`.

Here’s the example we did in class:

L = { a\^n b\^n | n ≥ 0 }

We pick `w = a^p b^p`, where `p` is the pumping length.

The lemma says:

* |xy| ≤ p
* |y| > 0

That means the substring `y` must lie **entirely within the first p characters** of `w`.  
Since the first `p` symbols of `w` are all `a`’s, it follows that `y` can only contain `a`’s.

So formally, the only valid decomposition looks like:

    x = a^k
    y = a^m   (m > 0)
    z = a^(p - k - m) b^p

When we pump down (take i = 0), we get:

xy\^0z = a\^(p - m) b\^p

Now the number of `a`’s and `b`’s don’t match anymore — so the string is **not in L**.  
That’s the contradiction showing `L` is not regular.

But here’s what confused me:  
My professor said we should look at *all* decompositions of `w`, so he also considered cases where `y` is in the `b`’s part or even overlaps between the `a`’s and `b`’s. He said he’s been teaching this for years and does that to be “thorough.”

However, wouldn’t those cases actually **violate the condition |xy| ≤ p**?  
If `y` starts in the `b`’s or crosses into them, then `|xy|` would be larger than `p`, right?

So my question is:

Is it technically wrong to consider those decompositions (with y in the b’s or between the a’s and b’s)?  
Or is it just a teaching trick to show that pumping breaks the language no matter where y is?

**TL;DR:**  
For `L = { a^n b^n | n ≥ 0 }`, formally only y inside the a’s satisfies the lemma’s rules, but my professor also checked y in the b’s or overlapping the boundary. Is that okay, or just pedagogical?

1nzdqzx,(Gender) Diversity in Math: Is it still relevant? (Discussion+Survey),"Hi everyone,

as part of the local Women in Mathematics group, we are interested in your opinion on diversity-related projects and laws - of course, we are mostly focused on the aspect of women, but since our math department is pretty white, we are probably not as aware of the important topics of non-white people.

To make our lives easier, it would help us if you type your answer here: [https://forms.gle/yRgXeHHzuCbsnBxq6](https://forms.gle/yRgXeHHzuCbsnBxq6)

But of course, feel free to discuss here, I will certainly read the comments.

Some questions/topics for discussion:

\- Do you think it is still an important issue to discuss about diversity and inclusivity in mathematics nowadays?

\- Do you feel like working in academia is affecting your life choices, in a good or bad way?

\- How do you feel about gender quotas, since they are a heavily polarizing topic?

\- Have you noticed a lack of female/non-white/... role models, and do you think it affects you or the future generation?

\- Mostly for women: Has having a period influnced your work life?

\- What stereotypes are there about women/non-white/... people in mathematics and how much do you feel they are (not) true?

1nzbfya,Why has classical geometry fallen out of focus in modern mathematics?,"or most of history, geometry was basically the only kind of mathematics people studied. Everything else algebra, analysis, etc seems to have evolved from geometric ideas( or at least from what I understand) People used to think of mathematics in terms of squares, cubes, and shapes.

But today, nobody really cares about geometry anymore. I don’t mean modern fields like differential or algebraic geometry, I mean classical Euclidean geometry the 2D and 3D kind. Almost no universities teach it seriously now, and there doesn’t seem to be much research about it. You don’t see people studying the kind of geometry that used to be the center of mathematics.

It’s not that geometry is finished - I doubt we’ve discovered everything interesting in it.  
  
 There are still some people who care about it, like math competition or Olympiad communities, but that’s about it. Even finding a good, rigorous modern book on geometry is rare.

So why is geometry so ignored today?",OkGreen7335,1759731362.0,378,0.94,90,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1nzbfya/why_has_classical_geometry_fallen_out_of_focus_in/,/r/math/comments/1nzbfya/why_has_classical_geometry_fallen_out_of_focus_in/,math,True,False,False,False,False,,False

That got me thinking about mapping arguments, mapping proofs, to different objects they weren't originally intended for. In effect this generalizes a proof, but then I started thinking about compound maps

For example, this argument about average shadows in effect maps 3D shapes to numbers, well, then you can take that result and make an argument about numbers and map them towards something else, in effect proving something more about these average shadows

That sounds simple enough, obvious, but then I thought that maybe there are some ""mappings"" that are not obvious at all and which could allow us to proof very bizarre things about different objects

I skipped school a lot in high school and had no real regard for any of my classes. Anyways all that matters is that im struggling more than the average student. Right now we're just learning about polynomials, and if im being honest they're really fun to do. 

The issue is that I get overwhelmed when im writing them down. So many numbers, exponents and variables that I inevitably just forget to include either a variable or exponent.  Sometimes ill get all the numbers correctly at the end only to forget to make one of them negative (this literally just happened lol). 

But thankfully I just came upon something that has helped me out. I put the terms in boxes, and once I finish combining the terms I cross off the box and do the next box. This small little trick has helped me out tremendously. So for you guys, what is one small thing that you do that helps you focus?

1nvzn27,What to do when editor is not responding/doesn't exist?,"I've been waiting for almost a year to get back from the editor of a journal I've send my paper for a review.

It's been the first time that the editor has not gotten back to me in such a long time (and median waiting time for the first contact from an editor is a few months, btw).

Therefore I've decided to send an e-mail to the address provided by the site on which everything is done, but then I get an automated message which gives me an arror that the user I've emailed to doesn't exist on their domain (and this is a Springer journal, so it's not some sort of shady journal and the review process is done on Springer Nature website).

So, with no answer and no way to contact the editorial office, I've wanted to see can I withdraw my paper, but there is no link or anything to do so. This way, I'm in a situation where my paper is possibly forgotten by an editor who possibly quit or got fired from his job, so the e-mail is no longer working and there is no automated way to withdraw the paper. ""Contact support"" just gives a variety of FAQ links, with no e-mail to contact anybody.

So, my question is, would it be illegal or would it be a copyright infringement to just attempt to publish elsewhere and if this journal, by any chance, responds, just say that I want to withdraw my submission?

1nvx3kd,"What error am I making?  (Proposed Counter-Example to the Proof of Word-Problem Undecidability in which  the Baumslag-Solitar Group BS(2,3) is Partially Undecidable.)","
The Baumslag-Solitar group *BS(m,n)*, may be presented as *< a,b | a^(−1)b^(m)a b^(-n) = 1 >*.

# Cayley Graph Construction

Each Baumslag-Solitar group has a Cayley Graph *C(m,n)* that can be described by the fibers of a projection *P: C(m,n) -> R(m,n)*.  *R(m,n)* is the regular directed graph where each vertex is incident to *m* edges coming in and *n* edges departing, and is a tree.

The fiber *P^(-1)(v)* of each vertex in *R(m,n)* is a linear infinite sequence of vertexes linked by a directed edge from one vertex to the next.  By labelling each edge ""*b*"", we turn *P^(-1)(v)* into the Cayley graph of the group of integers **Z** with the group action *k(b) = k + 1* for each *k* in **Z**.  Each vertex in this fiber is also incident (in *C(m,n)*) to one incoming edge and one departing edge which are not contained in the fiber, but will be discussed next in the edge fiber description.

If an edge in *R(m,n)* is represented as a directed edge from vertex *V* to vertex *W*, the fiber of this edge is a set of directed edges from *P^(-1)(V)* to the fiber of *P^(-1)(W)* called transversal edges.  We indicate each transversal edge by its starting vertex *v* and ending vertex *w*, and describe the transversal edges of the fiber with the following rules:

* Each transversal edge from *v* to *w* will have a neighboring transversal edge connecting *(v)b^(m)* to *(w)b^(n)* and a neighboring transversal edge connecting *(v)b^(-m)* to *(w)b^(-n)*.
* For *k* between *-m* and 0 or *k* between 0 and *m*, there is no transversal edge in the edge fiber incident to *(v)b^(k)*.
* There is an edge in the edge fiber that connects a point from *P(-1)(V)* to *P(-1)(W)*.

Now, each of the vertexes in *C(m,n)* have just enough incoming and outgoing edges that they can be assembled together so that the action of *b* cycles through all of the incoming transversal edges and independently cycles through all of the outgoing transversal edges.  The precise order of the cycles is not important, and can in any case be changed by an isomorphism of *R(m,n)*.

We label all of the transversal edges ""*a*"" to get the Cayley Graph required.

To show that this is, in fact, the Cayley graph of *BS(m,n)* we need to verify regular closure.  Start at any vertex *v* in *C(m,n)*.  There is a unique inbound transversal line *a*, so its start is *(v)a^(-1)*.   if we travel *m* *b*-edges from this starting point, we reach a vertex *(v)a^(-1)bm*, whose unique outgoing transversal edge returns to the original, once we travel it, we are *n* *b*\-edges past the original vertex *v*, and traveling through these vertex closes the path of *v = (v)a^(-1)* *b^(m)* *a b^(-n)*.

Each edge fiber with it's incident vertex fibers is easily visually described as a bunch of these paths stacked upon each other, and it is obvious that each path can be filled with a 2-simplex that will be contained in the edge fiber.  With all of these paths filled, we get a shape that looks like **R** x *R(m,n)*.  This shape is simply connected, verifying that there are no hidden relations in *C(m,n)*.

We also designate an arbitrary vertex in *C(m,n)* as the origin point.

# Geometric Claim

Now any word *w* of our alphabet *<a,b>* indicates a path in *C(m,n)* from the origin point to an end-point. These points are the same if and only if  *w* represents the identity element.  This provides an algorithm that in linear time (by word length) computes whether the word is an identity or not.

The problem here is this contradicts a critical step in the proof of the undecidability theorem, which states that *BS(2,3)* can compute if a word representing the identity in finite time only if the word does not represent the identity.  \[Citation Needed\]

# Classification of Reductions

The next step is to translate this algorithm into something that doesn't require a copy of *C(m,n)* to solve words in *BS(m,n)*. After all, I can barely describe this graph, let alone build a working copy.

With the projection as before, we see that a cursor traversing any *a*\-edge will result in movement of a projected cursor on *P(m,n)*.  The projected *P(m,n)* figure is not a Cayley graph, but it is a tree, so any word with an *a* or *a^(-1)* will need to return to the fiber containing the origin, and this can only be achieved if the *b* count (relative to the entry *a* edge) divides *m* if we are using an outgoing transversal to return from an incoming transversal or *n* if we are using an incoming transversal.  When this happens, the *b* count of that transversal will need to be scaled by *n/m* or *m/n* respectively.

These rules are met by the reduction schema

*a^(-1) b^(mk) a -> b^(nk)*

*a b^(nk) a^(-1) -> b^(mk)*

for every *k* in **Z**. Along with the inversion reductions *bb^(-1) ->* (lambda) and *b^(-1)b* ->* (lambda), these are  sufficient to generate an word  that is empty if and only if the original word represents the identity element of the group.",Hefty-Particular-964,1759389549.0,11,0.82,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1nvx3kd/what_error_am_i_making_proposed_counterexample_to/,/r/math/comments/1nvx3kd/what_error_am_i_making_proposed_counterexample_to/,math,True,False,False,False,False,,False

1ntbvba,What kind of space is the most adequate to visually represent music? (r/musictheory xpost),"We are happy calling melodies ""lines"", and we are used to see them laying on 2D surfaces, such as scores or scrolls. The horizontality of those devices helps perceiving the temporal dimension of music, but at the cost of other factors. Although optimal for visualizing rhythm loops, circles are famously employed to highlight interval shapes, usually sacrificing temporal progress.

3blue1brown made a video about topology that showed that some kind of torus or möbius strip are more suitable shapes to lay music intervals. I wish I'd be able to grasp it. I intend to tackle Tymozcko's Geometry of music.

My interest comes from the intuition that there's still much research to be done on the field of representing music. I fancy stuff such as fractals and 4D objects which I know little about.

1nrado4,What are your thoughts on informal/exploratory mathematics?,"When I first went to college, I was unaware that there was a distinction between formal and informal mathematics. The distinction was never explicitly stated or even mentioned. I went in assuming that all proofs were exploratory by nature, and had been the original means by which mathematical concepts were discovered. I always found myself wondering how anyone could be so brilliant as to think up such strange algebraic steps. Nobody ever told me that the proofs were really just sensible algebraic steps from the conclusion to the premise, presented in reverse. In retrospect, I realize that relatively little was taught about how certain challenges were tackled historically, before the answers were known. This gives me the sense that there is more that I could have learned if it had not been kept from me.

But I have had some very positive and fulfilling experience personally playing around with equations, testing them, changing them to see what happens, etc. It is a fun thing to see different approaches to solving a problem and then trying to figure out why those approaches work, or whether they always work. Seeing and working with math informally has, in my opinion, provided more value than formal math has. Obviously, I am biased, but I want to know the thoughts of this community.

Some of the topology books I’ve looked at introduce nets, and I’m wondering if I can safely ignore them.

Not gonna lie, this is due to laziness. As I understand, nets were introduced because sequences aren’t always enough to capture convergence in arbitrary topological spaces. But in sequential spaces (and in particular, first-countable spaces), sequences are sufficient. From my research, it looks like nets are covered more in older topology books and aren't really talked about much in the modern books.

1noy4if,Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives axiom,"As part of my [ongoing confusion about Arrow's Impossibility Theorem](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1noktck/arrows_impossibility_theorem_axioms/), I would like to examine the [Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) axiom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_of_irrelevant_alternatives) with a concrete example.

Say you are holding a dinner party, and you ask your 21 guests to send you their (ordinal) dish preferences choosing from A, B, C, ... X, Y, Z.

11 of your guests vote A > B > C > ... > X > Y > Z

10 of your guests vote B > C > ... X > Y > Z > A

**Based on these votes, which option do you think is the best?**

I would personally pick B, since (a) no guest ranks it worse than 2nd (out of 26 options), (b) it strictly dominates C to Z for all guests, and (c) although A is a better choice for 11 of my guests, it is also the least-liked dish for the other 10 guests.

However, let's say I had only offered my guests two choices: A or B. Using the same preferences as above, we get:

11 of the guests vote A > B

10 of the guests vote B > A

**Based on these votes, which option do you think is the best?**

I would personally pick A, since it (marginally) won the majority vote. If we accept the axioms of symmetry and monotonicity, then no other choice is possible.

However, **if I understand it correctly, the IIA axiom\*\*\* says I must make the same choice in both situations.**

So my final questions are:

**1) Am I misunderstanding the IIA axiom?**

**2) Do you really believe the best choice is the same in both the above examples?**

\*\*\* Some formulations I've seen of IIA include:

a) The relative positions of A and B in the group ranking depend on their relative positions in the individual rankings, but do not depend on the individual rankings of any irrelevant alternative C.

b) If in election #1 the voting system says A>B, but in election #2 (with the same voters) it says B>A, then at least one voter must have reversed her preference relation about A and B.

c) If A(pple) is chosen over B(lueberry) in the choice set {A, B}, introducing a third option C(herry) must not result in B being chosen over A.",BadgeForSameUsername,1758673718.0,4,0.7,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1noy4if/independence_of_irrelevant_alternatives_axiom/,/r/math/comments/1noy4if/independence_of_irrelevant_alternatives_axiom/,math,True,False,False,False,False,,False

1noy0ux,Looking for resources/examples/information of dimension reduction for PDEs (2D -> 1D with closure terms),"I’m interested in learning more about dimension reduction techniques for PDEs, specifically cases where a PDE in two spatial dimensions + time is reduced to a PDE in one spatial dimension + time.

The type of setup I have in mind is:

* Start with a PDE in 2D space + time.
* Reduce it to 1D + time by some method (e.g., averaging across one spatial dimension, conditioning on a “slice,” or some other projection/approximation).
* After reduction, you usually need to add a closure term to the 1D PDE to account for the missing information from the discarded dimension.

A classic analogy would be:

* RANS: averages over time, requiring closure terms for the Reynolds stress. (This is the closest to what I am looking for but averaging over space instead).
* LES: averages spatially over smaller scales, reducing resolution but not dimensionality.

I’m looking for resources (papers, textbooks, or even a worked-out example problem) that specifically address the 2D -> 1D reduction case with closure terms. Ideally, I’d like to see a concrete example of how this reduction is carried out and how the closure is derived or modeled.

1noktck,Arrow's Impossibility Theorem axioms,"Voting systems were never my area of research, and I'm a good 15+ years out of academia, but I'm puzzled by the axioms for Arrow's impossibility theorem.

I've seen some discussion / criticism about the Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) axiom (e.g. [Independence of irrelevant alternatives - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_of_irrelevant_alternatives#Criticism_of_IIA)), but to me, Unrestricted Domain (UD) is a bad assumption to make as well.

For instance, if I assume a voting system must be Symmetric (both in terms of voters and candidates, see [Symmetry (social choice) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_(social_choice))) and have Unrestricted Domain, then I also get an impossibility result. For instance, let's say there's 3 candidates A, B, C and 6 voters who each submit a distinct ordering of the candidates (e.g. A > B > C, A > C > B, B > A > C, etc.). Because of unrestricted domain and the symmetric construction of this example, WLOG let's say the result in this case is that A wins. Because of voter symmetry, permuting these ordering choices among the 6 voters cannot change the winner, so A wins all such (6!) permutations. But by permuting the candidates, because of candidate symmetry we should get a non-A winner whenever A maps to B or C, which is a contradiction. QED.

Symmetry seems to me an unassailable axiom, so to me this suggests Unrestricted Domain is actually an undesirable property for voting systems.

**Did I make a mistake in my reasoning here, or is Unrestricted Domain an (obviously) bad axiom?**

If I was making an impossibility theorem, I'd try to make sure my axioms are bullet proof, e.g. symmetry (both for voters and candidates) and monotonicity (more support for a candidate should never lead to worse outcomes for that candidate) seem pretty safe to me (and these are similar to 2 of the 4 axioms used). And maybe also adding a condition that the fraction of situations that are ties approaches zero as N approaches infinity..? (Although I'd have to double-check that axiom before including it.)

**So I'm wondering: what was the reasoning / source behind these axioms.** Not to be disrespectful, but with 2 bad axioms (IIA + UD) out of 4, this theorem seems like a nothing burger..?

  
EDIT: Judging by the comments, many people think Unrestricted Domain just means all inputs are allowed. That is not true. **The axiom means that for all inputs, the voting system must output a complete ordering of the candidates.** Which is precisely why I find it to be an obviously bad axiom: **it allows no ties, no matter how symmetric the voting is**. See [Arrow's impossibility theorem - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem#Basic_assumptions) and [Unrestricted domain - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unrestricted_domain) for details.

Are there any ways to refine my conjecture as stated there? Or, is there any additional information that may be helpful for making progress on it, whether that means eventually getting to a proof or falsification?

Edit: It's been proven.

\*If n is less than or equal to 360, both concave and convex polygons are allowed in the conjecture. If n is greater than 360, only concave polygons are allowed, in order to cooperate with Euclidean space; of course, no negative angles either.",ImNotLtGaming,1758548342.0,5,0.78,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1nnmr6d/the_panprimangular_polygon_conjecture/,/r/math/comments/1nnmr6d/the_panprimangular_polygon_conjecture/,math,True,False,False,False,False,,False

Here is a version of the puzzle:

>Five people live on an island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, where a strange taboo reigns: it is forbidden to know the color of one's own eyes.  
Everyone can see the color of each other's eyes, but it is forbidden to discuss it, and if, by misfortune, one of the five inhabitants were to learn the color of their own eyes, he or she would have to kill him/herself the next day in the village square at noon when everyone is gathered there.  
One **Monday**, a stranger arrives on the island. In the evening, he dines with all the inhabitants and exclaims before them: “I'm surprised, it's not common to see someone with blue eyes in this part of the world!”. He then leaves.  
On **Tuesday**, the five inhabitants gather at noon as usual and have lunch.  
On **Wednesday**, the five inhabitants gather at noon as usual and have lunch.  
On **Thursday**, the five inhabitants gather at noon as usual, and three of them kill themselves.

**Question:** How can these events be explained?

I’m trying to wrap my head around the expression

∇×(∇×**E**)

where **E** is the electric field vector. The exact physical meaning of **E** isn’t important here — the key point is just that it’s a vector field.

This “double curl” shows up as one of the first steps in deriving the wave equation from Maxwell’s equations. I know the vector identity:

∇×(∇×**F**)=∇(∇⋅**F**)−∇\^2**F**

but I’m having trouble understanding what it really means geometrically.

I feel like I have a good picture of what the curl of a vector field represents, but when it comes to the curl of a curl, I get stuck. Is there a useful way to visualize or interpret this operation? Or is it more of an abstract tool that’s mainly there because it simplifies the math when deriving equations like the wave equation?

1nmn6cn,"The definition of a ""radical"" in Arnold's proof of the Abel-Ruffini theorem","I'm trying to understand [Arnold's proof](https://web.williams.edu/Mathematics/lg5/ArnoldQuintic.pdf) of the Abel-Ruffini theorem. Specifically, what is the definition of a radical?

**Definition 1**

Is a radical/nth root a function which takes a complex number and returns a set or n-tuple? If so then any possible formula solving a polynomial using such radicals would produce extra solutions, more than the number of roots of the polynomial.

Eg if we try and write the cubic formula using this definition of a radical with 2 levels of nesting, then the minimum number of solutions produced by 2 nested square roots is 4.

[Definition 5.4 of this paper](https://www.math.ru.nl/~mueger/THESES/Mereyn_Vrij_Bachelor_2022.pdf) which tries to give some topological basis to the Arnold proof defines the radical to be the set of lifts under the covering map `x -> x^n`. However I believe this suffers from the same problem of producing extra incorrect solutions.

**Definition 2**

The problem with definition 1 leads me to think that a radical in any formula for the roots of a polynomial must be a pre-chosen nth-root out of all possible n-th roots. This is what is indirectly done in the existing cubic and quartic formulas. 

The problem with this is that it doesn't allow us to take the radical of a loop in the complex plane and end up with a path, which I believe is required for the Arnold proof.

Eg Let `f : C -> C`, `f(x) = sqrt(x)` be the positive square root, and let l be a loop in `C \ {0}` be defined as the loop that goes around the unit circle twice. Then `f o l` will be discontinuous and therefore not a path, which the proof relies on.

Any help on this would be much appreciated!",Kurren123,1758445555.0,19,0.92,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1nmn6cn/the_definition_of_a_radical_in_arnolds_proof_of/,/r/math/comments/1nmn6cn/the_definition_of_a_radical_in_arnolds_proof_of/,math,True,False,False,False,False,,False

We don’t study them in high school, and they’re not taught at the university either, so it feels like an entire branch of mathematics is skipped over. I’d like a book that actually gathers these results and develops them systematically.

Most importantly, I want this book to be rigorous. It should start from proper definitions of points, lines, areas, and so on and present proofs with care, rather than glossing over the logical structure.

1njb6ua,Advice Needed: Choosing Between Numerical Linear Algebra and Algebraic Topology,"For context, I am in an unusual position academically: While I am a first-semester sophomore at a large R1 state school, I worked very hard throughout middle school and high school, and as of last spring, I have tested out of or taken all of undergraduate mathematics courses required for my major. I have thus been allowed to enroll in graduate courses, and will be taking mostly grad courses for the rest of my degree. I feel like I am at the point where I should start to focus on what I want to study career wise, hence why I am seeking advice from strangers on the internet.

I also have a lot of internship experience. I spent three summers working generally on applications of HPC in particle physics, one summer working on machine vision at a private company, and as of last spring I am doing research related to numerical linear algebra. I have a very strong background in numerical methods, Bayesian inverse problems, and many connections within the US National Lab system.

However, I have always seen these jobs and internships as what was available due to my age and lack of formal mathematical education, and imagined myself perusing some more theoretical area in the future. At the moment, if I were guaranteed a tenured position tomorrow, I would study some branch of algebraic topology. However, pursuing such a theoretical branch of mathematics, despite being ""pushed"" in the opposite direction for so many years is causing me stress.

While I admit I am advanced for my age, I don't think of myself as particularly intelligent as far as math people go, and betting my area of expertise on the slim chance I will land a job that allows me to study algebraic topology seems naive when there are so many more (better paying) numerical linear algebra adjacent career opportunities. That is not to say I don't also enjoy the more computational side of things. The single most important thing to me is that I find my work intellectually interesting.

I expect many of your responses will be along the lines of ""You are young, just enjoy your time as an undergrad and explore."" My critique of this is as follows: I am physically incapable of taking more than a couple grad-courses in a semester in addition to my universities required general electives. Choosing my courses wisely impacts the niche I can fulfill for prospective employers, allows me to network with people, and will impact where I go to graduate school, and where I should consider doing a semester abroad next year. The world is not a meritocracy, and I am not being judged on my ability to solve math problems; I feel there is a ""game"" to play, so to speak.

What advice would y'all give me? I'll try my best to respond to any questions or add further context to this post if requested.

Cheers!

1nj4p6m,Proof in Futurama S13E14,"(spoilers for the newest season of Futurama).

So I've been watching the newest season of Futurama, and in the fourth episode, they literally meet Georg Cantor, in a universe inhabited only by whole numbers, and their children, fractions. Basically, the numbers want to put Farnsworth and Cantor on trial, which requires all the numbers to be present (pretty crazy judicial system, lol). But Farnsworth says all the numbers aren't here, and when he's accused of heresy, Cantor proves it, by taking an enumeration of the rationals between 0 and 1 and constructing a number differing from each number on a different digit. AKA the usual Diagonalization arguemnt

So Cantor's diagonalization is usually used to show ""the real numbers aren't countable."" But what they prove in the episode is actually just ""there exist irrational numbers."" Which feels weird to me...but is mathematically valid I guess. I've almost always seen this proved by showing sqrt{2} is irrational via infinite descent. But that could just be pedagogy...

Of course, right after Cantor proves this, Farnsworth says ""you know there are easier ways to prove that right?"" But then Bender makes says ""infinities beyond infinity? Neat."" There were other references to higher infinities in the episode, and I'm slightly worried it would confuse people, as the episode (and outside research) might lead people to think they've actually seen a proof that ""the reals aren't countable."" In fact, when I watched this while high last night, that's what I thought they did. But they didn't. You would need to start with an enumeration of the reals to do that. Did anyone else think that was confusing? Like I appreciate what they were trying to do but...why not give the traditional proof, or make the narrative involve showing higher infinities exist? It feels like they knew they couldn't do too many math heavy episode and crammed two ideas into one.

On the other hand, I got a kick out of the numbers attack them for heresy after proving this, despite accepting the proof -- clearly an illusion to the story of the Pythagoreans killing the person who proved sqrt{2} is irrational.

Anyway, what did you guys think of that episode?",RimskyKors,1758087113.0,59,0.89,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1nj4p6m/proof_in_futurama_s13e14/,/r/math/comments/1nj4p6m/proof_in_futurama_s13e14/,math,True,False,False,False,False,,False

1nios31,What physics topics should I focus on as a math master’s student aiming for theoretical physics research?,"I’m currently doing a master’s in mathematics with a physics minor. My long-term goal is to do research in theoretical physics. From my reading and exploration, I’ve narrowed my interests down to *cosmology* or *quantum field theory* (leaning towards QFT).

So far, I’ve taken some undergrad-level physics courses in mechanics, thermodynamics, and electrodynamics. For my next few semesters, I want to plan a focused path. I was thinking of revisiting mechanics and quantum mechanics first, but then I’m unsure—should I move on to thermodynamics & statistical mechanics, solid state physics, or classical field theory?

1nik40l,What are your thoughts on a non-rigorous visual math course on topics like differential geometry and complex analysis?,"So first off, my background is physics, and that is applied physics, not theoretical. 


When I look into certain math topics like differential geometry, I wish I could learn it and be exposed to its ideas without having going into every nitty gritty detail on definitions and proofs. 


In fact, I think I would quite enjoy something where it actually relied more on intuition, like drawing pictures and ""proving"" stuff that way. Like proof by picture (which is obviously not an actual proof). I think that can also be insightful because it relies more on ""common sense"" rather than very abstract thinking, which I guess resonates a little bit with my perspective as a physicist. And it can maybe also train ones intuition a little better. And for me personally (maybe not everyone), I feel like often times when a math course is taught very rigorously, many of the visualizations that would be natural and intuitive get lost and I view the topic much more abstractly than I have to. 

I feel especially complex analysis and differential geometry would be kind of suited for that. 

Part of the course could also be showing deceitful reasoning and having to spot it. 


I wish universities offered courses like this, what do you think? Like offer an elective course on visual mathematics or something, but which is not intended to replace the actual  rigorous courses of these subjects.

1ni1lyp,When did you realise you have some talent for pure math?,"Today, while commuting from work, I managed to solve problem B6 (the last ones are meant to be the hardest) of [Putnam 2010](https://kskedlaya.org/putnam-archive/2010.pdf).

>Let A be an n ×n matrix of real numbers for some n ≥1.  
For each positive integer k, let A\^\[k\] be the matrix

>obtained by raising each entry to the kth power. Show

>that if A\^k = A\^\[k\] for k= 1, 2, . . . , n + 1, then A\^k = A\^\[k\] for

>all k ≥1.

Having just finished self-studying LADR, I was looking for some more challenge and decided to give Putnam LinAlg problems a try.

My solution was inspired by Axler's approach to operator-calculus:

>Assume T is the operator in R\^n that has A as the matrix wrt the standard basis. Then the minimal polynomial p(T) of T has deg p <= n.

>Note that because of the condition given in the problem, for any formal polynomial u with 0 constant term and degree <=n+1, u(A) = u\[A\] (where u\[M\] is u applied to every element of M instead of the whole matrix itself)

>Now simply define polynomial s(x) = xp(x), so that deg s <= n+1. Obvious that s has 0 as the constant term

>Since p(T)=0 => s(T)=0=s(A)=s\[A\]

>=> every element of A is a zero of polynomial s(x).

>But now apply division lemma on A\^m for any m:

>A\^m = s(A)q(A)+r(A), deg r(A) <= n, r(A) has 0 constant term.

>But again,

>s(A) = 0 => A\^m = r(A) = r\[A\] = A\^\[m\] (where the last equality follows by doing the same division on each element of A, since s(x)=0 for each x in the set of elements of A)

I felt pretty good about figuring out the idea in my head to a problem which is supposed to be one of the hardest in a competition meant to challenge bright math undergrads in the US. Since I have no prior experience with math competitions and I am purely self-taught, I believe that it won't be vanity to assume that I have a little knack (and undoubtedly a lot of interest) for math.

When did you think to yourself that you aren't a total tool (at-least comparatively, because there will always be arbitrarily difficult and insurmountable problems) when it comes to math? Do you attach atleast a little bit of pride in being ""better"" at math problem-solving/theory-building (however one might choose to evaluate those traits) compared to your peers?

For sure, an overwhelmingly large fraction of the pleasure I derive from math comes from an appreciation of the sheer structural beauty and deep connections between seeming disparate fields, but for those who consider themselves ""talented"", do you feel that the satisfaction of finding oneself to be ""better comparatively"" is an ""impure"" source of self-satisfaction?

I know research mathematics is not a competition, and math needs all the good people it can get, but even then you can sometimes tell when a professional mathematician seems to be ""in orbit"" compared to their peers.

1nhl74x,Can you recommend any texts about the abstract mathematical theory behind machine learning?,"So far I haven't really found anything that's as general as what I'm looking for. I don't really care about any applications or anything I'm just interested in the purely mathematical ideas behind it. For a rough idea as to what I'm looking for my perspective is that there is an input set and an output set and a correct mapping between both and the goal is to find a computable approximation of the correct mapping. Now the important part is that both sets are actually not just standard sets but they are structured and both structured sets are connected by some structure. From Wikipedia I could find that in statistical learning theory input and output are seen as vector spaces with the connection that their product space has a probability distribution. This is similar to what I'm looking for but Im looking for more general approaches. This seems to be something that should have some category theoretic or abstract algebraic approaches since the ideas of structures and structure preserving mappings is very important, but so far I couldn't find anything like that.

For example, when I read theorems, proofs, or definitions, I usually understand them in the moment. I might even rewrite a proof to check that I follow the logic. But after a week, I forget most of it. I don’t know what the best approach is here. Should I re-read the same proof many times until it sticks? Should I constantly review past chapters and theorems? Or is it normal to forget details and just keep moving forward?

Let’s say someone is working through a book like Rudin’s *Principles of Mathematical Analysis*. Suppose they finish four chapters. Do you stop to review before moving on? Do you keep pushing forward even if you’ve forgotten parts of the earlier material?

The problem is, I really love math, but without a clear structure or external goal, I get stuck in a cycle: I study, I forget, I go back, and then I forget again.

1nftiyi,A twist on magic square,"I've been interested in the problem of constructing a magic square of squares (it was mentioned on Numberphile a few times) for a while now. Apparently, it's a hard one, and no solution has been found yet. While researching it, I came across the Green-Tao theorem, which states that one can construct arithmetic progressions of arbitrary length out of primes. This is rather amusing in itself, but what I recognized is that it also allows is to construst a magic square of **sums of two squares**, where every element is **prime**. That follows from these well-known/obvious results:

1. It is possible to build a magic square out of any 9-member arithmetic progression sequence (APS).
2. Any prime of the form 4n+1 can be written as a sum of two squares.
3. Per Green-Tao theorem, there are APSs of primes of arbitrary length.
4. It does not explicitly says anything about APSs of primes of the form 4n+1, but those do exist, the first one over 9 elements (12 total) being 110437 + 13860k.

Combining those, one can obtain the following magic square, for example, with every row, column, and diagonals adding up to 497631, and each element being a prime:

159^(2) \+ 356^(2) | 246^(2) \+ 401^(2) | 139^(2) \+ 324^(2)

211^(2) \+ 306^(2) | 114^(2) \+ 391^(2) | 149^(2) \+ 414^(2)

216^(2) \+ 401^(2) |  86^(2) \+ 321^(2) | 104^(2) \+ 411^(2)

1net0bm,Applying to a PhD in algebraic number theory as a high-school teacher with uneven undergrad grades,"I’m preparing applications for PhD programs in pure mathematics (algebraic number theory/algebraic geometry) and would appreciate guidance on how admissions committees are likely to evaluate my profile and how I should focus my applications given financial constraints.

Background:

B.A. in Mathematics & Physics from a small liberal college; math GPA ~3.0. Grades include C in Real Analysis I and Abstract Algebra I, but A in Real Analysis II and Abstract Algebra II. The lower grades coincided with significant financial/family hardship (over the course of my college year a war that broke out in my country led to losses of family members and property destruction).

After graduation, I taught high-school mathematics. In parallel, I did research in ML and published a peer-reviewed paper (graph-theoretic methods in ML).

I have been sitting in on two graduate mathematics courses (including algebraic number theory) at one of Princeton, Harvard, or MIT(for anonymity). I completed the problem sets, and my work was evaluated at the A−/A+ level on most assignments. The professor has offered to write a recommendation based on this work.

However, I cannot afford to apply to many programs, so I want to target wisely and request fee waivers when appropriate.

Questions:

For pure-math PhD admissions (esp. algebraic number theory), how do committees typically weigh later strong evidence (A’s in advanced courses, strong letter from a graduate-level instructor) against earlier weak grades in core courses? Will a peer-reviewed ML publication that uses graph theory carry meaningful weight for a pure-math PhD application, or is it mostly neutral unless tied to math research potential?

Given budget limits, is it more strategic to apply to strong number theory departments? What’s a sensible minimum number of applications to have a non-trivial chance in this area?

Recommendations for addressing extenuating circumstances (brief hardship statement vs. part of the SoP vs. separate addendum) so that the focus remains on my recent trajectory and research potential. I’m not asking anyone to evaluate my individual “chances,” but rather how to present and target my application effectively under these conditions.

Thank you for any insights from faculty or committee members familiar with admissions in algebraic number theory/pure mathematics.",External-Feeling-424,1757648479.0,141,0.93,36,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1net0bm/applying_to_a_phd_in_algebraic_number_theory_as_a/,/r/math/comments/1net0bm/applying_to_a_phd_in_algebraic_number_theory_as_a/,math,True,False,False,False,False,,False

1neb30g,Gambler’s ruin following the martingale strategy,"A gambler starts with a fortune of N dollars. He places double-or-nothing bets on independent coin flips that come up heads with probability 0< p < 1/2. He wins the bet if it comes up heads.

He starts by betting 1 dollar on the first flip. On each subsequent round, he either doubles his previous bet if he lost the previous round, or goes back to betting 1 dollar if he won the previous round. If his current fortune is not enough to match the above amounts, he just bets his entire fortune.

**Question:** What is the expected number of rounds before the gambler goes bankrupt?

**Remark:** The betting scheme described above is known as the [martingale strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martingale_(betting_system) (not to be confused with the mathematical notion of a martingale, though they are related).

1ndfcci,Existence of a factorisation in a ring,"Some time ago I’ve reviewed the proof of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic (FTOA), which basically states 2 things:
1) Every number can be factored into a product of prime numbers.
2) This factorisation is unique.
Now, for the second statement, in order to prover it, we use the euclid’s lemma, which is a pretty strong statement that i know does not hold in general for every commutative integral domain. But for the first statement (the existence of a factorisation), we do not need it. If I recall correctly, the proof is done by induction and only relies on the fact that a number is either irreducible or not. We can generalise the first statement into: “every element can be factored into a product of irreducible elements”. At first glance, my intuition would say that this theorem holds pretty much in any commutative integral domain, after all an element is either irreducible or not, and if it isn’t, you can break down its factors until you hit a point where only irreducible elements remain (which is what the induction proof in Z basically does). But i thought really hardly and came up with a counter example: Take Z and let’s add the n-th roots of 3 (n is a positive integer). If i’m not mistaken this is still a commutative integral domain, but here’s the issue: take 15 and let’s break it down factors,
15 = 3*5 = sqrt(3) * sqrt(3) * 5 = 3^1/4 * 3^1/4 * 3^1/4 * 3^1/4 * 5 = … every time you can always break down the n-th roots of 3, and you never hit a bottom where only irreducible elements appear.
So my question is:
What happened when I added the n-th roots of 3? Why does the first statement of FTOA hold in Z but not in this new ring? Why can’t I, in the new ring, do the same proof that I did in Z? More generally, how much can i relax the hypotheses in my ring in order to at least have the existence of a factorisation for every element?",HeftyCitron119,1757513592.0,12,0.88,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1ndfcci/existence_of_a_factorisation_in_a_ring/,/r/math/comments/1ndfcci/existence_of_a_factorisation_in_a_ring/,math,True,False,False,False,False,,False

1ndami7,What is/was your plan B if academia doesn't work out?,"Since around 2008, early-career academic careers in pure mathematics have become extremely unstable. There are not enough postdocs for most PhD students. Then, in turn, most postdocs never become competitive for an assistant professorship. This is, more-or-less, semi-independent of the school you do your PhD in (ie. most PhD students at Harvard also have a hard time landing TT and postdoc positions). Statistically, the overwhelming majority of PhDs in mathematics will never land a permanent academic position. Consequently, I imagine almost every postdoc and PhD student has likely thought about what their backup plan would be.

In the past, it seems like most people who left mathematical academia went into either quant trading or data science. However, the latter is rapidly becoming harder to access without formal qualifications in that area. At the same time, the ""classical pathway"" into academia: PhD -> 1 or 2 internally funded postdocs -> NSF or Marie Curie postdoc -> TT position, is becoming harder with recent cuts.

1nctuhf,Spatially efficient embedding for Sudoku puzzles,"Hello math reddit!

I got a bit nerd sniped by this problem, and I was kind of going down a rabbit hole, hoping some of you might have ideas on how to improve upon my brainstormed ideas. I am currently writing a relatively big Sudoku solver. Now a Sudoku puzzle can just be input as 81 numbers in a long string with 0 not being solved and 1-9 for each field. That's all fine and good. But that got me thinking: Is there a better way to embed this problem and send \_less\_ data than those 81 numbers in sequence.

So I started to go down a bit of rabbit hole. Now I have a cryptography background, so naturally the ideas I came up with all pretty much relate to this area. My first idea was this: It's a 9x9 matrix, right? So is there a way to multiply this matrix (let's call it `A`) with a vector `v` so that we get a result `s` where we can use both `v` and `s` to uniquely reverse the calculation? Then we would (in theory) only require 18 numbers to be sent over and would have to reconstruct `A`. If we now go over a finite field like GF(11) (swapping out 0 for 10), this does have some interesting properties and as far as I can tell this at least makes it theoretically have an inverse due to being a field over primes. The issue is that this does not seem to be uniquely solvable because it lacks constraints. We would essentially try to losslessly reconstruct 324 bits of information from a 72-bit summary (assuming 4 bits per number), effectively breaking information theory.

But only in theory. In practice, a Sudoku is not an ordinarily structured 9x9 matrix. It has very specific construction rules such as every number only being in every 3x3 box once, etc. - I don't think I need to explain the theory behind that. This structure might help in reconstructing the puzzle more effectively. At this point I tried to take a step back and formalize the problem a bit more in my head. 

I am essentially looking for an embedding of a 9x9 matrix such that I trade raw information for computationally obtainable information through an embedding of sorts based on the unique structure of a Sudoku. I know that a Sudoku in and of itself is an embedding which tries to provide the least amount of information to still be solvable in a unique way, but I am not about specifically solving the Sudoku at this point. This is only about transmitting/embedding the actual data as is. Think of it a bit like an incredibly problem-specific compression algorithm.

To illustrate my point a bit better: 6 is just a single number, but contains an embedding of two prime numbers 2 and 3 in it, meaning in this way it trades of sending two numbers for embedding them in the prime factorization. I'm kind of trying to think in a direction like that. Obviously extracting this information is at the very least a subexponential algorithm, so it's definitely not computationally feasible, but since we are not really worrying too much about n -> infinity cases and are strictly in a 9x9 case I feel like the fact this is an NP problem only partially matters in a way.

Now I've tried to reason about other ways to achieve this with linear codes, or with some other form of algebraic embeddings or an embedding on an elliptic curve maybe (Notice the recurring cryptography theme here? lol). Another idea was to construct a polynomial of degree 9 and just embed it this way, maybe factoring the polynomial on the other end and hoping I could find some form of constraint to not have to transmit 81 numbers (I guess at this point it's personal and no longer about just transmitting less numbers).

But I'm unfortunately lacking the fundamental training of a mathematician to rigorously reason about the constraints of the problem. I'm just a humble computer scientist. This kind of seems to touch more on Algebraic Geometry as a field, at least to me this sounds more like an algebraic variety and you could rephrase the question as ""What is the most efficient way to describe the coordinates of a single point on this specific, known variety?"". But then again, this is far outside my comfort zone.

Like I said, I'm too un-mathy to reason too deep on this specific subject. So I come to you for some brainstorming. Now obviously there is neither the necessity nor any incentive to be gained from transmitting \_less\_ than 81 exact numbers. But I feel like this is fun to reason about and maybe you guys enjoy diving into this a bit like I did. It might also be that someone much smarter than me is just gonna come around to point out how this is exactly impossible to do, at which point I at least learned something new. Maybe I am just way overthinking this (very likely), but who knows. :)

1nbrjqi,What is the meaning of homogeneity,"I am learning homogeneous equations and I have a few questions.

  
I encountered the first order linear homogeneous equation of the form dy/dx+P(x)y=0. I also have another definition for nonlinear homogeneous equations of form dy/dx=F(y/x).

  
I also read this on the text book: ""\[the equation of form Ax\^m\*y\^n(dy/dx)=Bx\^p\*y\^q+Cx\^r\*y\^s\] whose polynomial coefficient functions are“homogeneous”in the sense that each of their terms has the same total degree,m+n=p+q=r+s.""

But, why does this definition not working when using the LINEAR cases like I stated before. For example, dy/dx+xy=0 is considered a first order linear homogeneous equation, but the total degree is different 0!=2!=0. In this case, the definition of homogeneous is not found on the book, and it seems to me it is just when the right hand sight is zero.

1nbrars,What is the best *useful* approximation of π?,"I've always found the usual approximations of π kinda useless for non-computer uses because they either require you to remember more stuff than you get out of it, or require operations that most people can't do by hand (like n-th roots). So I've tried to draw up this analogy: 

Meet Dave: he can do the five basic operations +, -, ×, ÷, and integer powers \^, and he has 20 slots of memory.

Define the ""usefulness"" of an approximation to be the ratio of characters memorized to the number of correct digits of π, where digits and operations each count as a character. For example, simply remembering 3.14159 requires Dave to remember 6 digits and 0 operations, to get 6 digits of π. Thus the usefulness of this approximation is 1.0.

22÷7 is requires 3 digits and 1 operation, to get 3 correct digits, so the usefulness of this is 0.75, which is worse than just memorizing the digits directly. Whereas 355/113 requires 7 characters to get 7 digits of π, which also has a usefulness of 1. 

Parentheses don't count. So (1+2)/3 has 4 characters, not 6.

Given this, what are good *useful* approximations for Dave? Better yet, what is the *most* useful approximation for Dave?

Then, I thought about using manim and its extension to manim slides, where I would mostly use it for transforming formulae and highlighting key parts, which I personally find, helps a lot and makes things easier to digest, although the creation of these animations are a bit more work.

But I’m unsure if this is the best course of action since its also very time consuming and therefore I want to ask you: 
- What kind of presentation do you prefer? 
- Any experiences with software (if any) or suggestions on what to use?

Keep in mind that in my case, it is not a geometric proof, although I would be interested on that aspect too.

1nbiwtj,Anyone aware of any literature relating to infinite geometric sums that get turned into functions that 'oscillate'?,"sorry, really not sure how to describe this well. I'm currently doing the IB diploma and did my math IA (essay) on modelling drug doses. I used a geometric sum and treated each dose like an exponential decay, such that after 1 hour the concentration would be like Ce\^-kx, or just Cr\^x. where r is e\^-k.

This is pretty standard I've found plenty of literature on this, where the infinite geometric sum is taken to find the final ""maximum concentration"" since ar is <1 so it converges, and it says doses are taken every T hours, so the sum is C/(1-r\^T). 

However I wanted to add nuance to my IA so I turned it into a function S(s) where s is some ""residual time"" that pretty simply oscillates the function. 0<s<T even though it's ""infinite time"" between a maximum and a minimum, by then just multipling the infinite sum by r\^s.

Then I went further, and wanted to consider if someone took placebos, or ""forgot"" to take their meds every like 10 pills, and so I factored this in, and with some weird modular arithmetic and floor functions I got a really funky looking function that essentially outputs the concentration at any time. 

[Ignore St, that was for before I started talking about placebos. P is for placebo, S is for non-placebo. I'm basically just taking the total concentration and subtracting the contribution that the placebos WOULD have made had they been taken. T is the time period for a single dose, so like usually 24 hours. M is how often there is a placebo, so like M of 4 means ever 4th drug is a placebo. C is just the initial \\""impulse\\"" or concentration of the drug. So my function is not continuous, as made evident by the floor function, but either way I think its mathematically interesting. ](https://preview.redd.it/usuhs35ypwnf1.png?width=1355&format=png&auto=webp&s=025de8e8ef7b61a79010297e62a25d565ec7bb96)

I literally don't know if any of this is real or works so I was wondering if anyone knew about any literature regarding this? Sorry if this post is hard to understand. From what i've discovered it seems to work, I've been using Lithium as my ""sample"" drug for the IA and i found that someone would have to take a daily dose of between like 250 and 550mg a day to stay in the safe range (under absolutely ideal circumstances), and the real dose is 450mg so it seems to work lol. 

Converting the infinite geometric sum into a function that oscillates seems really intuitive to me but I can't see anywhere online that talks about it, so literally everything beyond that point was just a jab in the dark. I found that considering placebos was actually quite interesting, the total long term maximum only reduced a little amount, but the long term minimum reduced by a lot. Makes sense intuitively but mathematically oh boy the function is uglyyy.

A problem I found with my function is that the weird power on the left part of the function collapses to zero when the function is at the point of discontinuity, so if I want to evaluate a maximum I have to do it manually.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borsuk%E2%80%93Ulam\_theorem#Equivalent\_results](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borsuk%E2%80%93Ulam_theorem#Equivalent_results)

|:-|:-|:-|
|Brouwer fixed-point theorem|Sperner's lemma|Knaster–Kuratowski–Mazurkiewicz lemma|
|Borsuk–Ulam theorem|Tucker's lemma|Lusternik–Schnirelmann theorem|

Tucker's lemma can be proved by the more general Ky Fan's lemma.

The combinatorial Sperner and Fan lemmas can be proved using what I call a ""molerat"" strategy: for a triangulation of M := the sphere/standard simplex, define a notion of ""door"" so that

* each (maximal dimension) subsimplex has 0, 1, 2 doors
* there are an odd number of doors facing the exterior of M then basically you can just start walking through doors until you end up in a dead-end ""traproom"". Because there are an odd number of exterior doors, there must be at least one ""traproom"". ""Molerat"" strategy since you're tunneling through M trying to look for a ""traproom"".

I'm happy to provide a link if necessary).

In this paper in section 5 `Fast Overlap Test of OBBs` in the third paragraph the authors talk about a theorem regarding two polytopes:

>We know that two disjoint convex polytopes in 3-space can always be separated by a plane which is parallel to a face of either polytope, or parallel to an edge from each polytope.  
\[...\]  
A proof of this basic theorem is given in \[15\].

And reference \[15\] is

>S. Gottschalk. Separating axis theorem. Technical Report TR96-024, Department of Computer Science, UNC Chapel Hill, 1996.

But after some search I can't seem to find any reference to this.

Does anybody know this theorem regarding two polytopes in 3D and can perhaps point me to a reference or proof of this? I'm not talking about the general Separation of Axis theorem (convex subsets in R^(n...)) but rather the polytopes in 3D.

1nazd4n,A graph theory state space problem,"About 2 weeks ago I watched 2swap's video on [Graph Theory in State-Space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGLNyHd2w10) (go watch the video if you haven't already, or most of this post won't make much sense), and it got me asking for a few questions:

1. Is the correspondence from one of these Klotski puzzles to a graph always unique?
2. Can you take any connected simple graph and ""go backwards"" making a Klotski puzzle out of it? If not, how can you tell for a given graph whether or not this task is impossible?
3. How can you take a graph and generate a Klotski puzzle out of it (given that the task is indeed possible)?

Before we go any further, I'd like to make a few changes to the rules used in the video:

1. Unlike traditional Klotski, you aren't trying to release a given block from its enclosure. Its better to think of this version less like a game and more like a machine or network.
2. The blocks aren't strictly rectangles. The blocks can be any shape as long as all of the sides are straight, each of its sides are an integer multiple of some fixed distance *d*, all of the vertices create either 90 or 270 degree angles, there are no ""holes"" in the block, and given subsections of the block aren't connected to another subsection just diagonally. So a block shaped like the letter ""L"" would be valid, while 2 squares connected together by just a corner would be invalid.
3. The walls of the puzzle don't have to form a rectangle. They can be any shape we want, given that all of the segments of each wall are straight, all of the sides of each wall are an integer multiple of that same distance d and all of the corners of the walls form 90 degree angles. The walls don't even have to be one continuous section, or prevent the blocks from travelling towards infinity.
4. The number of blocks isn't necessarily finite.
5. The number of wall segments isn't necessarily finite.

I already proved the answer to the first question, and the answer is no, and it can be shown with this super simple counterexample.

1nayfx1,Random path ant problem with complex numbers.,"Well, I thought this problem might be interesting, so I'm sharing it here. I haven't solved it and I doubt I can, but maybe someone here has a good grasp at these concepts and manages to find a solution.

Suppose you have a square (Space ""A"") that has two of its corners at the origin 0 and 1+i. Then you put an ant inside said square at a random location (with the same density in every part of A) and you give the ant a random path with al length that will grow exponentially as n increases. Then you draw a circle (space ""B"") with a radius of 1/n centered at (0, 0). Let's take n for only natural numbers to make it easier.

Let's define ""random path"" a bit better. Imaginary units of the form e^it can represent a rotation when multiplied to any complex number. Let's imagine something that produces random numbers in the real line and name it R(t) (it isn't deterministic and gives different results even when we plug in it the same value, also it has the same density at any point of the real line). The formula for the random path I will use is: {sum from m=1 to 2^n} of ( e^(iR(m) )/n)

Three things can happen with the random path. It either escapes space A, it finds space B (without having left A at any point before the path touches B) or it stays in A without ever finding B. 
For the cases where it escapes A we will repeat the path infinitely from the same random point until it either finds B or it stays in A (without finding B).

Now that I more or less defined the rules I will evaluate the problem at n=1. It has a 100% chance to end up in B because the first vector with a length of 1 will either appear inside B, lead to B or escape A. The only exceptions are  the vectors that appear in the corners, which amount to 0% or the infinite sum of cases.

So, my question now is. What chance does the ant have to find space B when n=2? What about n=3? Will it be 0% when n approaches +∞? What type of function approximates the chance of the ant finding B?

Now that I’m starting Community College and plan to transfer to a university. I’m realizing how much I’ve set my self behind.

I missed out on being able to compete and solving IMO problems, which I probably wouldn’t have been able to anyway, but want to make up for it by taking Putnam which is just this goal I have to help me stay dedicated to studying I guess. I feel like I lost that skill of picking up math easily and it’s taking me a little longer to understand things in precalculus which is honestly kind of killing that interest in math.

1n9a934,"I wrote a concise book on quantum mechanics for a general mathematical audience, link inside. Prereqs: linear algebra, multivariable calc, high school physics","A while back I made a post asking if there is any interest in a concise text on QM, for a mathematical audience. It's not completely finished, but I had a few requests to upload the partially completed version for now.

Link: https://github.com/basketballguy999/Quantum-Mechanics-Concise-Book/blob/main/QM.pdf

In my view, anyone who knows linear algebra and a little calculus can understand QM. This text is my attempt to write something at a level that a first or second year undergrad in math, engineering, or computer science would find readable, and that physics students would find helpful, but which could also serve as a quick 1-day introduction to the subject for eg. a math professor who is curious about the subject and wants an easy read.

Quantum mechanics at its core is a very simple theory. A physical system is represented by a vector in a vector space, and the components of the vector in different bases encode the probabilities of observing different values for things like energy and angular momentum. As the system changes in time, the vector changes.

I'll try to compare this book to existing quantum texts. ""Quantum for Mathematicians"" kind of books, like Hall and Takhtajan, are written at a much higher level, and in many ways the focus is on the math. For example, neither one says much about entanglement.  My goal is to communicate all the important physics as clearly and concisely as possible, using as little math as possible, but no less than that. This is something that standard texts like Griffiths and Sakurai fail to do, in my view, but in the other direction; the basic mathematical ideas are not spelled out clearly. Math students in particular tend to have a hard time learning physics out of books like this, and I think this lack of mathematical clarity causes problems for physics students too.

Part of the motivation behind my text is this. Everyone who knows calculus automatically knows some classical mechanics, namely kinematics; given a function x(t), the derivative x'(t) can be interpreted as the velocity, the second derivative x''(t) as the acceleration, etc. It's just a matter of putting some physical language to the math. In a similar way, everyone who knows linear algebra can easily understand QM by putting some physical language to the math. There's no reason every math/CS/engineering/etc. major can't graduate understanding basic QM.

There is an introductory plain language chapter that covers the main ideas of QM, and then the main text is under 100 pages. There is additional information and calculations in the form of footnotes and appendices. I tried to keep the main text as streamlined as possible, so that it can be read easily and quickly.

There are some references to missing sections. I have some notes on entanglement and related topics that will hopefully constitute a complete final chapter in a month or two, and some appendices on various topics that I'm planning to finish (eg. distributions, the Dirac delta).  I'll post an update when it's done.",basketballguy999,1757090511.0,224,0.97,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1n9a934/i_wrote_a_concise_book_on_quantum_mechanics_for_a/,/r/math/comments/1n9a934/i_wrote_a_concise_book_on_quantum_mechanics_for_a/,math,True,False,False,False,False,,False

2. Halbeisen (*Combinatorial Set Theory with a Gentle Introduction to Forcing*), on the other hand, uses the Reflection Principle to find models of finite fragments of ZFC. But if the principle gives us a method of creating models of every finite fragment of ZFC, wouldn’t that (and Compactness Theorem) amount to a proof of the consistency of ZFC?

1n89syb,Not so impressive result on the use of AI in math,"I'd like to point out an interesting paper that dropped on arxiv today. Researchers from Luxembourg tried to use chatGPT to help them prove some theorems, in particular to extend the qualitative result to the quantitative one. [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.03065](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.03065) 

In the abstract they say:  
""On August 20, 2025, GPT-5 was reported to have solved an open problem in convex optimization. Motivated by this episode, we conducted a controlled experiment in the Malliavin–Stein framework for central limit theorems. Our objective was to assess whether GPT-5 could go beyond known results by extending a qualitative fourth-moment theorem to a quantitative formulation with explicit convergence rates, both in the Gaussian and in the Poisson settings. ""

  
They guide chatGPT through a series of prompts, but it turns out that the chatbot is not very useful because it makes serious mistakes. In order to get rid of these mistakes, they need to carefully read the output which in turn implies time investment, which is comparable to doing the proof by themselves.

""To summarize, we can say that the role played by the AI was essentially that of an executor, responding to our successive prompts. Without us, it would have made a damaging error in the Gaussian case, and it would not have provided the most interesting result in the Poisson case, overlooking an essential property of covariance, which was in fact easily deducible from the results contained in the document we had provided."" 

They also have an interesting point of view on overproduction of math results - chatGPT may turn out to be helpful to provide incremental results which are not interesting, which may mean that we'll be flooded with boring results, but it will be even harder to find something actually useful.

\- Middle school and highschool give students more complex problems, not caring about making it simple for them, creating the ""math=long counts and formulas""

1n7ox8x,Learning/Teaching Abstract Algebra Structures,"Hi. This post is just for fun. 

In the first year of my bachelor course in Mathematics in Italy they taught us about algebraic structures and their properties in this order: semigroups, monoids (very few properties were actually discussed tho), groups (we expanded a lot on these), rings, domains and fields. (Vector spaces were a different class altogether) 

The reasoning behind this order was basically ""start from almost nothing and always add properties"", and it seemed natural to me for someone who just started actually studying mathematics. This is because any property could be considered as ""new"", e.g. it doesn't matter if you don't have multiplicative inverses because it just seems like any other ""new property"".

While studying abroad and researching on the web tho, I noticed that in other universities, even in my same country, they teach these things in complete reverse order, so by taking fields/rings and then ""removing"" properties one by one. Thinking about it, this approach might have the advantage of familiarizing students early with complex structures, because a general field has a lot of properties in common with the real numbers.

My question to you is: how were you taught about these structures?

1n7ou5d,Approximating the hyperbolic tangent function with piecewise linear functions,"I would like to know how to build a sequence of continuous piecewise linear functions which converges ""as fast possible"" to the tanh function on [-1,1] with respect to the supremum norm. As a reminder, the function is defined for all x by tanh(x)=(e^{2x}-1)/(e^{2x}+1), and it has a ""sigmoidal shape"".

By ""as fast as possible"", i mean that the obvious construction of splitting the interval in n pieces of equal length and connecting the parts of the function graph works, but is not optimal (away from zero, the function is quite flat, so intuitively one shouldn't need as many linear pieces as around the origin where the function varies the most).  

So my question is, given a continuous piecewise linear function f_n on [-1,1] which consists of n pieces, how small can the supremum norm of f_n-tanh get? And how to construct the optimal f_n (if there is such a thing as ""optimal f_n"" here).

1n7h3ks,Questions about the relation between gradient and normals to level surfaces,"Note: I am aware that in some places the gradient is defined as the vector that represents the linear map that is the derivative. However, for simplicity, I am calling the partial derivative vector of a function its gradient since that's the notion I am used to.

So I learnt in my calculus class that for a level surface f(x, y, z) = 0, the normal at a point p is grad(f)(p) if it exists and is nonzero. 

Evidently though, it is possible for a function to not even have a gradient defined at some point, but its level surface to still have a well defined normal. An example is f(x, y, z) = |x\^2 + y\^2 + z\^2 - 1| = 0 at the point (1, 0, 0). So the existence of a nonzero gradient is sufficient, but not necessary, to guarantee the existence of a normal.

So that made me wonder, and I've come up with a few questions:

For a level surface S defined as f(x, y, z) = 0 and a point p that it passes through,

1. If grad(f)(p) exists and is nonzero, but f is not differentiable at p, is the normal vector to S at p defined (and equal to grad(f)(p))?

2. If grad(f)(p) = 0, then is it still possible for S to have a normal at p? Is it related to the differentiability of f at p?

3. In general, what does the non-existence of Df(p) mean for the normal to S at p?",KRYT79,1756911517.0,1,0.6,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1n7h3ks/questions_about_the_relation_between_gradient_and/,/r/math/comments/1n7h3ks/questions_about_the_relation_between_gradient_and/,math,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1n7e5vi,Some cool maths facts which were weird to me at first,"There are numerous mathematical tricks and interesting facts available (far too many to include in one Reddit post). However, a few of them felt wrong because when I first came across them, I wasn't as much of a maths nerd, but I liked it and tried to link it with philosophy. However, it turned out to be a horrible idea for my mental health, haha.

Some of them are:

Multiplication doesn’t always make numbers bigger. I grew up thinking “multiply = make it larger.” Then fractions appeared and ruined that idea.

The sum of all natural numbers equals -1/12 (in a certain sense).

1+2+3+4+⋯= -1/12 (Wikipedia [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_%2B_2_%2B_3_%2B_4_%2B_%E2%8B%AF) for in-depth explanation)

In ordinary arithmetic, that series diverges to infinity. However, with analytic continuation, it equals -1/12. AND THE WILDEST PART? That value actually shows up in physics and yields REAL EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS.

Gabriel’s Horn: finite volume, infinite surface area. It is a horn-shaped solid that can be filled with a finite amount of paint, but an endless amount of paint is needed to coat the outside. Studying topology must be really fascinating, huh? Unfortunately, I have a long journey in front of me before I reach that stage.

And the Banach–Tarski Paradox, which I first encountered while reading a list of paradoxes. Using the rules of set theory, you can cut a solid ball into a finite number of bizarre pieces and reassemble them into two balls of the same size as the original. I have nothing to add to this ""fact"".

And in hopes of keeping this post short, at last, Hilbert’s Hotel. An infinite hotel that’s full can still make room for new guests by rearranging the current guests. Even infinitely many new guests. This was vexing for the younger me, and it holds somewhat sentimental value, as I clearly remember working in Hilbert's Hotel as a dream career, haha.

1n7c7rr,Magic Square of Squares: A rambling essay.,"[https://youtu.be/0YkEdHxN64s](https://youtu.be/0YkEdHxN64s) \- Unnecessary to watch my video, I believe. But if you wanna listen.

I based all of my stuff off of the Anti-Parker Square video from Numberphile: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz9jOIdhzs0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz9jOIdhzs0)

I unfortunately call the formula ""mine"" in my video a lot. It's not.

    //   x-a  | x+a+b |  x-b
    //  x+a-b |   x   | x-a+b
    //   x+b  | x-a-b |  x+a

Pick any values for a and b so that a+b < x and a!=b.

This will produce a magic square. I have categorized them into 3 types because I need to test all potential combinations for those types.

What combinations? I have written some C++ to quickly take a number, square it, find all other square numbers that have an equidistant matching square and make a list. I then check the list for a magic square of squares. All Rows, Columns and Diagonals should add up to 3X.

We can see from the formula above we need 4 pairs that all revolve around the center value.

Because of the way I generate these and get values I always end up with matching sums for the center row, center column and diagonals. This is common to get.

The next big gain would be to have the top and bottom rows add up to the same as those previous values. I call this the I-Shape. I have done all of this up to 33million squared and not found this I-Shape. The program is multi-threaded and I had it running on google cloud for a month.

Now, with all of this, I can't brute force any further and expect to find anything in this lifetime. At the 33million range, each number takes about 620ms to calculate (on my PC). The program is extremely fast and efficient. I need mathematical help and ideas.

I'm going to re-calculate the first 10 or 20 million square numbers and output all of the data I can, hoping to find some enlightenment from the top \~100 near misses. But, what data should I get? We can get/calculate any data, ratio, sums, differences, etc for X, the pairs, or anything else we want.

I'm currently expecting to output:  
Number, SquaredNumber, Ratio to I-Shape, Equidistant Count, All Equidistant Values?

Once I have the list of the top 100, generating more info about them will be very easy and quick to do. Generating data for all 20 million will take a couple of days on my PC.

1n621f5,Maximum Length of Minimal Product of Transpositions in S_n,"I was wondering about this problem and couldn't find much about it online although I'm sure it's probably an exercise in a book somewhere. I think I have a pretty concise proof, but I am curious how other people would go about proving it. Here is the problem:

It is well known that any permutation can be written as a product of transpositions. Call a permutation written as a product of transpositions *minimal* if it cannot be written as a product of fewer transpositions. **In the symmetric group S\_n, what is the longest minimal product of transpositions? i.e. What is the largest number of transpositions in S\_n you can compose which cannot be written in fewer transpositions?**

If you want to try this before seeing my solution, stop reading.

I'm curious how others would go about this. Maybe there is a simpler reason I am not thinking of (or maybe my proof is wrong and I am missing something), but here is my answer and proof: (I will be assuming S\_n is the set of permutations on the labels 1,...,n. And I will refer to the {1,...,n} as ""the labels"").

My answer: >!The longest minimal product of transpositions in S\_n is a product of n-1 transpositions.!<

*Proof*. First, to show there are elements requiring at least n-1 transpositions, consider the permutation (1 2 ... n). Suppose this can be written as the product of k < n-1 transpositions. Notice that no transposition in this product is disjoint from all the others, since no two labels in (1 2 ... n) are swapped. This means that, after the first term in the product, each of the remaining k-1 transpositions in the product introduce at most one new label to the overall permutation. So, we get #labels ≤ 2 + k - 1 < 2 + (n-1) -1 = n. So fewer than n labels appear in the permutation. However this is impossible since no label in (1 2 ... n) is fixed. So, we must have k ≥ n-1.

Also since (1 2 ... m) = (1 m)...(1 3)(1 2), then up to relabeling, any m-cycle can be written in m-1 transpositions. Since any permutation can be written as a product of disjoint cycles, and the lengths of these cycles adds to at most n, then each cycle can be turned into a product of transpositions one less than the length of the cycle, and we get a product of <n transpositions. So no permutation requires more than n-1 transpositions.

1n5xtpw,Equivalence Class of Sets of Finitely Many Points in General Position,"Hi. Suppose I have n points in general position (i.e. no 3 are collinear) on the 2D plane (call such n points a ""n-configuration"" for the sake of terminology)

Then I draw the n choose 2 infinite lines by picking all pairs and putting the line on the plane. We have a line arrangement rhat is somewhat nicely behaved, we can tell each point has n-1 lines passing through it etc.

Now imagine all the continuous movements I can do on the points I placed, such that the point does not cross any line. (Mentally I imagine this as having a triangle, dragging a corner around so I have triangles with different angles, but we never have 3 points collinear, it blocks there since there'll be a line from the other two points). Each such movement clearly gives a new n-configuration.

I have a few questions or just sanity checks about this construction:

- Equivalence Relation: If two n-configuration can be transformed to each other using such transformation, they're said to be equivalent. This is clearly reflexive, anti-symmetric, and my gut tells me it is transitive

- Equivalence Classes: If it is an equivalence relation, I think this construction has finitely many equivalent classes. How could one possibly generate it? I've thought of iteratively adding points like a tree (3-configurations have 1 equivalence class, so any 4-configuration must be any representative from the 3-config + another point. Any 3-config splits the plane into 7 areas. Adding points there and just looking at it, actually of these 7 areas there is only 2 ""equivalent"" ones. We can iteratively maybe create more equivalence classes but it gets a bit weird.)

- Literature Request: Is there a name for this ugly combinatorial/geometric object, equivalence classes or the transformation I'm talking about? Or is there something I'm missing that makes this object not well-defined?

Many of the books on stochastic processes eventually list Dellacherie-Meyer ( DM ) as a reference,  a bit like many books on Algebraic geometry will eventually cite EGA/SGA

Now when i lookup these Dellacherie-Meyer references they  seem to be about 'potential theory'

So i am wondering how much of a rabbit hole i would be getting into if i did study the DM brooks thoroughy

1n5r85v,What's the integral of sin(gamma(x)) dx?,"Gamma here is the famous gamma function, and to make the title shorter I will write here that the integral is evaluated from 0 to +∞.

I saw that the integral from 0 to +∞ of sin(x^2) dx converges and same for the integral of sin(1/x) dx or sin(1/x^2) dx from 0 to 1 (I guess the pole at gamma(0) is similar).

So I imagine this integral I ask about converges, but I couldn't find any post talking about it anywhere and I'm curious to know if this somehow diverges or if there is a closed form for the solution.

1n5nfxj,An aha moment regarding the twin prime conjecture!,"So I’ve been reading Analysis 1 by Tao and I’m on the last chapter now. I started to watch a Numberphile video regarding the Twin Prime conjecture in which they show a snippet of Yitang Zhang’s result about the 70 million bound. I had seen this video in the past but didn’t quite understand the snippet that was shown on the screen and just ignored it because I thought it was too advanced. 

When I saw the snippet this time, I immediately realised what he had proved. I mean I knew conceptually what he had proved but didn’t understand the notation of the result. 

I saw it and it showed that the limit inferior of the sequence p_(n+1) - p_n is less than 70 million. Namely, that the limit inferior of the sequence of the distance between consecutive primes is less than 70 million.

Now in reading Analysis 1, I had learnt about the limit inferior. And in particular, a basic result regarding the limit inferior. The result was that if the limit inferior(or superior) is finite, then it’s a limit point of the sequence. Which means that infinitely often, the distance between two primes gets close to a number less than 70 million. Now this number could be 2 or 11 or any number lower than the latest bound that we have. 

But this was such an aha moment for me. I almost felt like I could read the entire paper by Zhang. I haven’t taken a look at it yet but I will. 

This was a really joyful mathematical experience for me. I don’t really know how to express the joy I felt at understanding that snippet. I know it’s not the hardest thing to understand but I still think it’s cool that I understood it. 

There’s really no question here because I just wanted to share my excitement. But feel free to share any stories of when you’ve had a similar experience or anything else that’s relatable!

1n57p3g,"Consider the technique of ""Godel Numbering"". Are we justified in believing that there exist interesting truths about the natural numbers which can never be proven?","Consider the technique of ""Godel Numbering"".  Are we justified in believing that there exist interesting  and true properties of the *natural numbers* which can never be proven?

( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del_numbering )   

Some clarification of what I am asking.  It is trivially true that there are statements *about sets that cannot be proven* (e.g. The Continuum Hypothesis was an early discovery of undecidabilty).  So sets are off the table.  But can mathematics obtain a ""complete"" theory of the positive integers?   That is, for all true properties for all n >= 0,  deduction can find them? 

If the answer is ""no"" to the second question, it would leverage on the notion that all natural numbers correspond to a wff,  which is not true.     Lets denote this scenario the No-Universe.

Alternatively , if the answer is ""yes"" this means that all true properties of natural numbers can eventually have a corresponding proof.  In the Yes-Universe, there is something peculiar about recursively-enumerable sentences in a deductive system that disallows some formulas to map to integers via Godel Numbering -- but the converse is not necessarily true.   The peculiarity is not present in a mapping of integers to formulas.   ( a plausible *something* is self-reference : ""This formula is false.""  )

1n4yo22,Overly logically formal and general real analysis books?,"

Good morning!

I come from a background in logic and philosophy of mathematics and I confess I find the overly informal, stylized and conversational tone of proofs in real analysis books (be them introductory or graduate-level) disconcerting and counterproductive for learning: at least for me, highly informal reasoning obfuscate the logical structure of definitions and proofs and doesn't help with intuition at all, being only (maybe) helpful for those lacking a firm background in logic. This sounds like an old tradition/prejudice of distrust of logic and formalism that seems not backed by actual research or classroom experience with students actually proficient in formal reasoning (and not those who just came straight from calculus).

Another point of annoyance I have is the underestimation of student's capability of handling abstract concepts, insofar as most introductory real analysis books seem to try their best to not mention or use the more general metric and topological machinery working behind some concepts until much later and try to use ""as little as possible"", resulting in longer and more counterintuitive hacky proofs and not helping students develop general skills much more useful later. This makes most introductory real analysis books look like a bunch of thrown together disconnected tricks with no common theme.

I would be willing to write some course notes with this more notation-dense, formal and general approach and know some people who wish for a material like this for their courses (my country has a rather strong logicist tradition) and would be willing to help but I would find it very intriguing if such an approach was not already taken. Does anyone know of materials like this?

As a great example of what I am talking about one should look no further than Moschovakis's[ ""Notes on Set Theory"" ](https://archive.org/details/notesonsettheory0000mosc/)or van Dalen's [""Logic and Structure""](https://cin.ufpe.br/~mlogica/livros/Logic%20and%20Structure%20-%20Van%20Dalen.pdf). The closest of what I am talking about in analysis may be Amann and Escher's ""Analysis I"" or Canuto and Tabacco's ""Mathematical Analysis I"", however the former is general but not formal and the latter tries to be more formal (not even close to Moschovakis or van Dalen's though) but is not general.

I appreciate your suggestions and thoughts,

1n4a59v,I feel a bit lost. Should I tell my supervisor that I'm struggling?,"English is not my first language, I hope this post won't be hard to read.

I'm an undergrad, and I joined a research program (but more like a reading seminar right now) under the supervision of a professor at the beginning of this year (I’ll call him my supervisor from now on). At first, the reading materials he gave me were challenging but still manageable for me to understand. I would give presentations on what I had learned (an outline of the content, sometimes including proofs), and he would give me comments or introduce the topics I was going to read next. It was great, and I really learned a lot.

But the recent reading material he gave me is far beyond my scope. I tried to read it, but it feels like reading a Wikipedia page full of terms I don’t know, and when I click a link to learn one, it just takes me to another page with even more unfamiliar terms. I don’t think I’m a quitter when it comes to math, but I’ve been stressed and mentally trying to escape from it, because the gaps are overwhelming and it’s really frustrating to bang my head against the desk for several hours straight only to finish one page or sometimes even less because most of the time I end up reading background material instead of the assigned reading. Meanwhile, I also need to prepare for my master entrance exam, so I have even less time for this than usual.

Normally my supervisor gives me a deadline for meetings, but I’ve already postponed two meetings (it’s gonna be three) because I couldn’t finish the assigned part on time. I’m really grateful that my supervisor told me I can focus more on exam preparation for now, and he also suggested I ask questions about the readings, which I’ve done several times. But sometimes I didn’t, because the problem wasn’t that the proofs were too hard to follow, but that I just lacked the background knowledge entirely.

Because of deadlines, I’ve also ended up skipping parts I couldn’t understand after a while, just to move forward. I know this isn’t a good way of learning, especially since what I’m reading now is still considered elementary in this field, and I’ll need to learn it properly someday anyway if I want to stay in this field.

I think my supervisor might have overestimated my ability, or he expected me to push through, but it just turned out I failed. Since he will likely give me reading materials more advanced than this one once I “finished” this one, I’m thinking to tell him everything I’ve written above and maybe ask if him could give me some alternative materials. But I feel it would be irresponsible and embarrassing since I am the one that asked for joining the program and I even got scholarship for it (maybe I’m too fragile and too full of myself, cause I’ve done kinda ok on courses, even some graduate level ones). I’m also starting questioning myself if I’m really suited for this field if I’m already struggling this much even before strating grad school. Honestly I feel a bit lost right now, but I still really like math and want to do master and phd in the future, I just don't how should I do right now.

1n2tk9w,Is undergrad complex analysis worth taking in my situation?,"I'm a math and computer science major, and honestly the main reason I major in math is because I find it very interesting and is something I want to learn. However, it's a bit hard and I've struggled in upper level math classes (B in probability theory, B+ in real analysis, B+ in linear optimization).

This semester I plan on taking a rigorous version of linear algebra and potentially complex analysis (along with advanced data structures and machine learning).

[Link to video](https://youtu.be/J7D4TV0PU60)

Here is a draft of the video on Spec and schemes. I would like feedback.

**My goals**

* Show that the concept of locally ringed spaces (and the prerequisite concepts - topological space, ring, sheaf, local ring, etc.) arises naturally from generalizing properties of continuous functions on a topological space
* Turn things around and ask what kind of space has a ring as its ring of functions
* Try to show how the Spec construction follows naturally from trying to generalize the situation with continuous functions.

**Feedback questions**

* How to make it more visually appealing? Right now there's a lot of walls of text. The topic is very algebraic and I don't know how to avoid writing lots of text. 
* There are a ton of definitions which is overwhelming. How do I avoid this? Is this even avoidable? I'm assuming very little prerequisite knowledge from the viewer, which comes at the cost of having to introduce a ton of definitions and concepts.
* Motivation - some topics are well-motivated (sheaf, commutative ring), but others are not. Why should open sets be characterized by those four properties? Why should the points of Spec(R) be the prime ideals of R? How can I explain it to someone who is new the subject?
* How can I add more examples? I already do Spec(Z) as an example, but what are some good examples in the topology, commutative algebra, or sheaves part? 
* Should I expand the ""bonus topics"" at the end? I already give a ton of definitions in the video already.

I am a physics student and I am about to finish my bachelor's degree in physics in germany. Here it is part of the curriculum that as a physics student you still have to attend at least two pure math courses related to real analysis, called ""Analysis 1"" and ""Analysis 2"". For the most part I've enjoyed pure math a lot as well and all of my elective courses were either pure math e.g. ""Analysis 3"" which focusses on Lebesgue theory and complex analysis, or math courses for theoretical physicists e.g. Lie group theory + representation theory.

Analysis 1-3 was taught by the same professor who had a peculiar method of teaching where his lectures weren't rigorous whatsoever but rather focussed on the general concepts and the actual studying had to be at home by yourself. I have a feeling that I still have lukewarm experience in mathematical rigor and real analysis (complex analysis as well). This leads me to the desire to work through real analysis on my own again.

Obviously other curves would be more complicated, but didn't this lead them at least to rules of thumb?

What I'm asking is didn't people think it was significant that the slope of y = x^N was Nx and the slope of y = sin x was cos x and other simple transformations?

1mzsv19,Discussion: effective way of studying Math,"So, maybe this questions have been made before with some variations. I don't want to go over the same old ""how do I learn mathematics?"" or ""what is the best way to learn math?"" but maybe this is exactly what I am doing.....

Anyway, I'm not a Mathematician, I'm a Physicist and I am about to start a PhD. But my studies and my work are becoming more and more on the Math side, even tough it is still Physics. But I think I have never learnd Mathematics effectively. I mean, I learned a lot of Math but not like a professional mathematician or like the best math student in my class. And it was alright, but for the PhD I don't want to repeat the same mistakes from my Master (and from my undergrad studies).

My whole point is: when I study ""pure"" math it is kind of complicated. A Math book, usually, comes in the format: definition, another definition, a complicated definition, a theorem, and another theorem, then another definition, a super complicated theorem with a lot of hypothesis and so on.....

How do you study that? This is not like reading Dostoivesky or a Physics book. It won't have any effect just to read everything like a novel, but is also not effective at all to just write the definitions, write the theorem, copy the proof and so on like rewriting the whole book.

Yes, I can ""try to write down the proof by yourself without looking at the book"" but some books, the harsh ones and you know what I am talking about, have 200 pages of no problem solving and just definitions and theorems and even tough I write the proofs by myself, it have never been really effective for me. But I have never studies math like with total focus on the math, so maybe this is a new thing for me.

My real question, and maybe this is all silly, but I would really like to understand and try to put it all together so I can effectivelly develop a method for studying mathematics and go deep in it. Because, during the next 3 years, it won't be ""just know the theorem exists and its results"" but it will be ""you need to know hot to prove things and maybe even prove a new result"" and it scares me a lot. My next years will be much less ""calculating all energy levels of Helium"" to real complexity theory and functional analysis.

I tried using Anki, but maybe flashcards is not the best idea. Obsidian is a new tool for me, and I don't know if it can help. Without technology, maybe just pencil and paper and ""write down the theorems, try to prove it, come back after a few days, see if you remember, re-learn etc"" is still the best way?

Frankly, LADR sucks. Visually, it is triggering. The lack of symmetry in simple things triggers every once of OCD in my body, I have to fight off a seizure with every unfinished example box. Proofs seem a tad too lax. Examples are not very detailed and problems don't have this buildup in difficulty that I noticed better textbooks have. 

  
Also there is a strong lack of terminology introduction from what I have noticed. I finished two chapters and symmetric, upper, diagonal matrices have yet to be introduced. What's up with that?

At the moment, I am stuck on figuring out how to tackle the problem of fitting any generic triangle.

Definition of “best fit”:

Should it be the triangle that minimizes mean squared distance from the points to the triangle’s edges? Or the triangle that maximizes overlap with the convex hull of the points? Or perhaps the minimum-area triangle that encloses all the points?


Algorithms:

For circles and ellipses, least-squares fitting is straightforward, but for triangles it’s less obvious. Would one start from the convex hull and then search for an approximating 3-vertex polygon? Are there known methods in computational geometry for this?


Variants:

Different triangle types (equilateral, isosceles, right, scalene). Trade-offs between stability (robust to noise) vs. accuracy.

I’m currently experimenting with these approaches in code, but I’d really appreciate pointers to mathematical techniques, papers, or heuristics for triangle fitting.

1mylv1l,Notetaking and doing problem sets in Typst,"My friend and I are undergrads who just did the analysis and algebra sequences last year. Like many before us, we started out writing up our problem sets in LaTeX, using Overleaf, the VSCode plugin, or VimTeX. The results of course look great, but there are a number of frustrating issues, such as baffling error codes (wtf does underfull hbox badness 10000 even mean), long compile times for larger documents, 50+ line preambles etc. Someone recently made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1mqzuug/after_10_years_of_working_with_it_im_starting_to/) that I think sums up the problems with LaTeX pretty well.

A while back I found [Typst](https://typst.app/), a LaTeX alternative which came out a couple years ago. I was initially skeptical, since it seemed too new to have well established libraries, small community, annoying to have to learn a new language, etc. But I was actually able to get a custom homework template up and running within a couple hours, and it looked cleaner than my LaTeX setup. The syntax is simpler than LaTeX, the scripting language is quite powerful, and there are already a bunch of impressive user submitted packages on [Typst Universe](https://typst.app/universe/), from guitar chord diagrams to electronic circuits to poker hands.

Over the past year, my friend and I have [written our own package](https://typst.app/universe/package/ergo) to write customizable lecture notes and homeworks, particularly for math, CS, and physics students. If you're interested in Typst, I would encourage you to try it out for yourself first and begin writing your own config, but if you want something that works out of the box, it could be a good option. We put it up on Github here: [https://github.com/EsotericSquishyy/ergo](https://github.com/EsotericSquishyy/ergo).

Anyway, plug aside, I mainly wanted to spread the word about Typst. It's damn impressive software for something that's only been released for a couple years, and I think it has a real shot at becoming the LaTeX replacement down the line.",toxicbeaver3,1756008462.0,55,0.84,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1mylv1l/notetaking_and_doing_problem_sets_in_typst/,/r/math/comments/1mylv1l/notetaking_and_doing_problem_sets_in_typst/,math,True,False,False,False,False,,False

As I understand it, a harmonic function (like sine(x)) is not considered a fractal, a line is also not considered a fractal either, and I had read once about the fact that not all patterns can be considered to be fractals, but I'm trying to understand if there is some hard-defined rule for these distinctions. 

I would aditionally prefer it if any source of information you can share with me could have a focus on written text and equations, not actual images of fractals.

1mvyh24,Real Analysis. Am I Learning?,"Hi everyone,

I'm a few days into seriously self-studying real analysis (plan to take it soon, math major) and I've been drilling problems pretty intensely. I've been trying to build a mental toolbox of techniques, and doing ""proof autopsies"" to dissect the problems I've done. But it feels like I can only properly understand a problem after I've done it about 7ish times.

I also don't feel like I'm ""innovating"" or being creative? It feels like I'm just applying templates and slowly adding new variations. I don't think it's like deep mathematical insight. I'm not sure if I'm ""learning properly"" or if I'm just memorizing workflows.

I guess my question is if real analysis is primarily about recognizing and applying patterns, or does creativity eventually become essential? And how do I know if I'm on the right track this early on?

1mvn89q,"Math for Fun in Los Angeles?!?  I Like Hilbert Spaces in Fall, How About You?","Dr. Michael Miller, a retired researcher at RAND, has been teaching upper level undergraduate/graduate level math courses for fun at UCLA Extension for over 50 years. This fall, he'll be introducing Hilbert spaces to those interested in abstract math.

[His courses](https://boffosocko.com/2015/09/22/dr-michael-miller-math-class-hints-and-tips-ucla-extension/#Class%20History) are thorough and rigorous, but geared toward lifelong learners and beginners in abstract mathematics to allow people better entry points into higher level mathematics. His classes are interesting and relatively informal, and most students who take one usually stay on for future courses. The vast majority of students in the class (from 16-90+ years old) take his classes for fun and regular exposure to mathematical thought, though there is an option to take it for a grade if you like. There are generally no prerequisites for his classes, and he makes an effort to meet the students at their current level of sophistication. Some background in calculus and linear algebra will be useful going into this particular topic.

If you're in the Los Angeles area (there are regular commuters joining from as far out as Irvine, Ventura County and even Riverside) and interested in joining a group of dedicated hobbyist and professional mathematicians, engineers, physicists, and others from all walks of life (I've seen actors, directors, doctors, artists, poets, retirees, and even house-husbands in his classes), his **class starts on September 23rd at UCLA until December on Tuesday nights from 7-10PM**[**.**](https://boffosocko.com/2025/08/20/introduction-to-hilbert-spaces-an-adventure-in-infinite-dimensions/) If you're unsure of what you're getting into, I recommend visiting on the first class to consider joining us for the Autumn quarter. Sadly, this is an in-person course. I don't think there is an option to take this remotely or via streaming, and he doesn't typically record his lectures.

1muqovl,"if Busy Beaver eventually is independent of ZFC, does that mean it becomes larger than any computable number generated in ZFC?","You're going to have to dumb down any explanation for me because I'm only casually into math topics.

Anyway, I recently was reading about how BB(745) was independent of ZFC from this subreddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/14thzp2/bb745\_is\_independent\_of\_zfc\_pdf/)

I was trying to go through the comments, but I'm still not sure what exactly this means.

I get that eventually you could encode ZFC into a 745-state turing machine, and basically have it do the equivalent of ""this machine halts if and only if ZFC is inconsistent."" So then I imagine this machine in the context of finding the most efficient turing machine, for BB(745). BB(745) has to be a finite number, right? (For example, I could design a 745-state turing machine where all the states are simply ""print 1, HALT"" so even if every other turing machine doesn't halt, BB(745) would at least be 1)

But then imagine an even larger finite number, like TREE^(TREE(3))(3) or some other incredibly large formulation to intentionally overshoot whatever BB(745) is \[in much the same way I can say 10\^100 is an extreme upper bound for BB(1)\].

Well, you could then run our 745-state turing machine for TREE^(TREE(3))(3) steps. If it hasn't halted by then, then we know that this is one of the turing machines that will run forever, which means we just proved that ZFC is consistent, which we can't do by Gödel's second incompleteness theorem. Maybe this 745-state turing machine does halt and is either not the most-efficient turing machine or is the most-efficient for BB(745), but then we just proved that ZFC is inconsistent, and we can therefore prove that TREE^(TREE(3))(3) is actually 1 anyway. uh oh.

so, what does this mean? does this mean that this BB(745) is somehow both finite number but this number is somehow unbounded by any other number we can conceive of using ZFC?",itsthelee,1755628063.0,125,0.96,73,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1muqovl/if_busy_beaver_eventually_is_independent_of_zfc/,/r/math/comments/1muqovl/if_busy_beaver_eventually_is_independent_of_zfc/,math,True,False,False,False,False,,False

1muad6j,When can a limit of functions be turned into a function of limits?,"I’m asking about this because of some derivation of integrals I’ve been doing recently.

If you have a vector valued function, f(t), the area from it to the 0 vector is:

Integral(|f(t) ^ f’(t)|)dt * 1/2

Where ^ represents the wedge product from geometric algebra/Clifford algebra.

I’ve tested this formula with several shapes I know how to get the area of and it always works (including deriving the area under a polar curve formula).

Now, I got this formula the following way:

The area of a triangle formed by points, a, b,(represented as vectors) and 0 is |a ^ (a-b)|/2

Technically this is not the standard formula in geometric algebra, which is |a ^ b|/2, however both have the same magnitude.

Now I’ve done the following part more rigorously but for simplicity, let a = f(t + dt), and b = f(t), to get the area over an interval dt. The summation is not written, but assume it is.

|f(t + dt) ^ (f(t + dt) - f(t))|/2

=

(|f(t + dt) ^ (f(t + dt) - f(t))| * dt/dt)/2

(|f(t + dt) ^ ((f(t + dt) - f(t))/dt)| * dt)/2

1mtv958,Math Reading Suggestions?,"Just graduated with a Bachelor's in both computer science and math and was really interested in getting into reading between now and a (hopefully) future PhD program. I tried a couple of things out and wasn't really satisfied, so I was curious if anyone had any recommendations or ideas for my specific interest.

  
I've had a lot of interest in graph theory, so that was where I started. I was recommended by a professor I worked with both Four Colors Suffice and In Pursuit of the Travelling Salesman. While these were great reads, I was really hoping for something more mathematically involved, more similar to a textbook. After that I picked up a general graph theory textbook (Diestel's, third edition), and treated it like I was taking a class on it (taking notes, doing exercises, etc). However, this ended up just feeling like busywork, and I wasn't really enjoying it to the level I wanted to. Does anyone have recommendations for specific books / types of books between the two points? Something very engaging mathematically that will have me thinking, working through things, and learning, but also that has a narrative or progression throughout? Or does anybody know of a better way of reading a textbook personally for self study (does taking notes consistently take away from it?).

  
While I've expressed specific interest in graph theory, I'm interested in learning about basically any type of mathematics.

I get imposter syndrome a lot, like ""Oh I'm not that smart. I don't think I have what it takes. They could do it, but me? Idk."" This makes me wonder how other people felt about going further down the math rabbit hole.

Obviously intelligence plays a role in understanding more and more abstract/complicated mathematics. I don't believe that everyone on planet earth could understand a graduate level Topology class, even if they worked really really hard at it, but do you feel that if you can make it past the bachelor's, you could go all the way with an insane amount of patience, perseverance and grit? 

Is undergrad real analysis to a brand new student just as confusing as graduate level to someone with a bachelor's of way worse?

1mse5a1,Is there an intuition why root finding is less flexible than minimization?,"If I had a function from 𝑓: ℝ → ℝ and I wanted to find an 𝑥 such that 𝑓(𝑥) = 0, I could use Newton's method. Now suppose instead I had 𝑓: ℝⁿ → ℝ, it seems I couldn't, at least not directly. It seems that the `scipy.optimize.root` function _requires_ a function ℝⁿ → ℝⁿ. Ok, so I could just define 𝐹(𝐱) = [𝑓(𝐱) 0 ⋯ 0] and look for an 𝐱 such that 𝐹(𝐱)=0. This of course gives an 𝐱 such that 𝑓(𝐱) = 0. This approach _does_ seem to work for `scipy.optimize.root`, though I'm surprised those 0 values don't make the Jacobian non-invertible... maybe it's fine just because it estimates the Jacobian rather than computing it analytically?

Now let's say I wanted to add equality constraints, say ∑𝑥ᵢ = 1. I could just define 𝑔(𝐱) = 𝑥₁ + ⋯ + 𝑥ₙ - 1 and 𝐹(𝐱) = [𝑓(𝐱) 𝑔(𝐱) 0 ⋯ 0] and then do root finding. So far so good. But now if I wanted to add _inequality_ constraints, e.g. 𝑥ᵢ ≥ 0 for all 𝑖, as far as I can tell, I'm out of luck.

Instead, it seems what I need to do is formulate this as a _minimization_ problem. That is, I can define 𝑑(𝐱) = 𝑓(𝐱)². Now the problem is to minimize 𝑑(𝐱) subject to the equality and inequality constraints, i.e. a non-linear program. There's a ton of algorithms, but for practical purposes I can just call `scipy.optimize.minimize`.

Here's my question: **Why are there no general methods to find roots for functions given equality and inequality constraints?** There's a ton of algorithms if you can cast your problem as a minimization problem. But is just that people are more interested in minimization?

1msaaig,Is tipping just price-discovery or something else?,"I noticed on a Indian ride-hailing app (similar to Uber/Lyft) that drivers often won’t accept a $10 ride unless you add a $5–$10 “tip” up front. Without the tip, your request just gets ignored.

That made me wonder: is this really a “broken system,” or is it simply the market finding the fair price?

* If drivers refuse $10 but accept $15–$20, doesn’t that just mean the ride was underpriced before?
* Is tipping here just another way of doing **price discovery** (like surge pricing), except the rider does the bidding instead of the platform’s algorithm?
* Or is it fundamentally different, since it shifts the burden of figuring out the “right” price onto riders and makes the actual cost opaque?

Also: would **game theory** even be able to answer this question definitively? Or is this more of an economics/behavioral design issue than a clean equilibrium model?

I like to do the New York Times Crossword Puzzle. Today, I was delighted to see the clue:

24A Évariste \_\_\_, 19th-century French math prodigy for whom a differential theory is named

(Well, I suppose I would question the  word ""differential"" but that's small potatoes.)

This is a short biography of Galois that was included in the ""Wordplay"" column.

*Constructor Notes: I should tell you a bit about GALOIS.*

*Schoolkids learn the quadratic formula to solve ax²+bx+c=0 for x. The solutions are algebraic expressions in the coefficients a, b and c, using square roots. Add an x³ or x⁴ term to the polynomial, and you can still find the solutions, but with much more complicated formulas. The occasional crossword drop-in Niels Abel (1802-29) showed that with terms of x⁵ and higher, no such general formula for solutions can exist. Évariste Galois (1811-32) worked out the way to determine which polynomial equations have solutions in terms of their coefficients using radicals and which do not. His so-called Galois theory laid the foundation for algebra as it is studied today. He somehow managed to do this despite being expelled and twice jailed for his pro-Republican political activities. His works were completed in a letter he frantically wrote on the eve of a duel he knew he would lose. He was only 20. It would take 14 years for another mathematician to understand and publish his results. A nice synopsis of the life of math’s most film-worthy hero, pace Nash and Ramanujan, is here.*

1mrgwy4,Coxeter groups,"I've decided to self-study Coxeter groups over the summer and found them to be really interesting objects at the intersection of combinatorics, algebra, and geometry. However, I am still struggling to find answers to the following questions:

1. Coxeter groups can be studied as algebraic, combinatorial, or geometrical objects, but the properties in each context seem to be so different from each other that it almost feels like a miracle that we still work with the same thing. For \[the most primitive\] example, I don't see how the Exchange property (EP) behaves well with the canonical representation of a Coxeter group in GL, i.e., through reflections across different hyperplanes - I just know that the Coxeter group has the EP, and that CG can be represented as reflections, but I don't see the EP in reflections themselves. There are many other examples, so I wonder whether it is even reasonable/worth trying to understand how all of that fits together, or whether I should just focus on understanding them well in each context separately and jump from one to another whenever I need to prove something?

2. Why study them in the first place? Yes, I find them very cool and nice, but how often do they appear in other mathematical settings? What are the examples of problems in other math areas where Coxeter groups come in handy?

1mrce63,Singular Vertex Tilings - A New Class of Quasiperiodic Tiling,"In this post I present a novel class of quasiperiodic tilings which I call Singular Vertex Tilings (SVT).

In a regular quasiperiodic tiling, the vertices of the tiling are preserved in the next generation of the inflation. By contrast, in an SVT, each vertex of the tiling becomes the center of a regular polygon in the next generation of the inflation. When we look at the prototiles in the substitution rule, we find these regular polygons at every corner of the prototile.

For example, here is a tiling I call ""Dodecagon Boat"".

Note how all the corners of the prototiles are dodecagons, centered on the corners of the prototiles.

Here is a patch of the generated tiling:

One page 3 line 6 it says that $P=\\dot{\\cup}\_{j}Q\_{j}$. Now the way $Q\_j$ are defined (called components) in the proceeding lines means they are maximal consecutive integers in a set. So if $P={1,3,4,6,7,8}$ the components would be ${1},{3,4},{6,7,8}$. This made me think that the author is just signifying that the components are disjoint. The paper then on line 8 defines an extension $E\_d$ that extends each component down by $d$ digits. So $E\_3{6,7,8}={3,4,5,6,7,8}$. On line 12 though we again see the union with a dot to equate an extension of $P$ to a union of the extension of the components of $P$. Those second extensions though are not guaranteed to be disjoint.

I used to love LaTeX. It can produce wonderful results, and I loved experimenting with it to see what it can do. But now, I'm more critical. I have worked *a lot* with it, producing many math papers, theses, hobby projects etc. Lately, I find that with a growing workload and possible research ideas I could pursue, I'm mostly interested in writing down my ideas as quickly as possible, and on iterating on these quickly. I feel that LaTeX often stands in the way, forcing me to invest energy in the typesetting at regular intervals, interrupting my flow and slowing me down.

Here are some specific complaints:

1. I keep having to debug my typesetting. The system is as rigid and unforgiving as a programming language, and refuses to compile if you make a mistake. This of course slows me down, as I spend valuable time fighting with the system rather than thinking about how to best express an idea. This problem is made worse by the fact that its error messages are often very unhelpful, and make you hunt for your mistake in a bunch of text instead of directing you to it immediately. I just wish that, while I'm thinking about my math problem or on how to best present it to the public, I didn't have to also solve an entirely different engineering problem on how to get TeX to compile and not to produce horrendous results.

2. Working with citations is a pain. I think BibTeX is awesome, but it feels like a local optimum in the possible bibliography management solution space. When I want to cite something, I have to spend at least 5-10 minutes sourcing BibTeX data for it, correcting it and cleaning it up from all the junk that comes with it, adding it to the .bib file, citing it in the main file, and hunting for the specific place in the reference I want to cite and adding that too. This time adds up and is forever lost. It is annoying to have to care about all the detailed, finicky and specific bibliography information, when in practice everyone just googles the title of the reference and finds it easily. I know that creating ultra-precise bibliography info is necessary for science to work. I just wish I didn't have to do it myself.

3. Collaboration in LaTeX is lackluster. Overleaf is painfully slow to use (my main complaint) and non-free (the free plan getting more and more restrictive over the years). It has kind of a janky interface that distracts you. And, it takes forever to compile. Yet, it's the first choice everyone will go to when starting a collaboration project because there's nothing better. Well, maybe working with GitHub is better, but not everyone can be convinced to use it, and GitHub has its own problems. Chiefly, the high barrier to entry and to commit changes to the document, and having to constantly resolve merge conflicts. Also, I sometimes forget to commit changes which is annoying.

4. Input is slow. A mathematical formula that you can sketch out in handwriting in 30 seconds will take 1-2 minutes to typeset. It constantly generates errors due to superscripts, subscripts, dollar signs, parentheses, etc. Like, mathematical notation is so efficient and easy to use if you are writing in a notebook or on the blackboard. It enhances your thinking while writing. In LaTeX, all I can think about is how to be very careful putting the right parenthesis at the right place so that I don't get an error. It duplicates work because I'm writing my formula in my notebook and TeXing it afterwards. Also, tables and matrices are awful to input, forcing you to meticulously place those ampersand separators like 15 times per (substantial) table/matrix. I think tables are an excellent way to present content, but they're so painful to create that I put less of them in my writing than I could.

All in all, I just feel that it takes too long to turn my handwritten notes into typeset text; and trying to ""think"" in LaTeX directly is almost impossible since input and feedback is so slow and since you get constantly interrupted by errors.

Just to be clear, while writing actual computer code I find the problem much less pronounced. Yes, it can be frustrating, you also get lots of errors, etc., but working with computer code is better from an ergonomic perspective in at least two ways:

* You can think about your problem while coding: computer languages have gotten pretty good at being expressive and intuitive, so this allows you to think about your program while you're inputting it. I don't feel like I need to bust out the notebook to hand-sketch the structure of my program very often, while with math I feel like I have to do so for every moderately complicated theorem or proof.

* You can write code in a way that helps you write other code. In theory, if you solve a problem once then you can re-use that code or call that function every time you need it. You almost never repeat yourself while coding if you're doing it carefully. In LaTeX, this effect is much more limited. Very often, you have to write similar text/formulas multiple times, because it's the way it makes most sense to present something. But even though macros exist, they're never used as comprehensibly as modular design in programming. One wouldn't even necessarily want to, as too many macros can be confusing when collaborating, for example.  

I've come to the end of my reflection. If anyone has extensive LaTeX experience, feel free to respond with your own impressions, critiques, or to tell me where I'm wrong. I'm particularly interested in suggestions from experienced users on how to get my morale up again while working with LaTeX and how to become more effective at it. Here's a few possibilities I've thought about...

1. *Upskill.* Maybe even after 10 years I'm not good enough at using LaTeX and should look into improving my skill in a systematic way. Until now, my learning process has consisted of Just Doing It and googling for solutions to problems as they arise. Maybe that's not the most optimal way to learn. I'm interested in any and all suggestions in this direction.

2. *Delay.* I thought about the possibility of more strictly separating the research and typesetting phase of my various projects, and also of delaying the typesetting phase as much as possible. For instance, I could write a whole paper in my notebook first, and only after all the ideas are finalized start typesetting it. This solution has problems when collaborating, as is it is more difficult to communicate untypeset ideas to your coauthors. Again, here I'm also interested on hearing from those that successfully do it this way. 

3. *Automate.* I don't want to use any kind of LLM for my work. Maybe that's my problem, and I should change my mindset. But, I find them icky and don't want to let machines do my thinking for me. As for other ""automatic"" solutions, like bibliography management software, better editing tools, etc... somehow I found that these tools are often just another thing that gets in the way, and that the best technique for quickly putting content on the page has been to type every single character myself. Again, maybe it's a skill issue and some of you have suggestions on how to work with these tools.

I was wondering if it was a good idea to create a community (i didn't find any) where people could share solved (or partially solved) difficult exercises.

The first goal will be to share different ways to approach a same exercise: let's say I solved a problem, but my method is long and is using many theorems. I share my solution, and other people can give other (maybe more accessible) methods, or suggest other point of views...

The second goal will be to have a collection of college-level problems with different approaches to solve them (and corrections). People can just share solved exercises, and other people can train themselves solving them.

Of course, people can also ask for help, but there are already other communities for that.

1mphjmk,Self-study of optimization from mathematical perspective,"I would like to ask you for some self-study advice.

I have masters degree in theoretical physics, but I work in optimizations now. I have desire to learn the subject on a deeper level, so, at the moment, I am going through book by Bertsemas, Ozdaglar and Nedic about convex optimization. The textbook is written in a very mathematical theorem-proof style. I have no problem to understand it, but I do have a problem of learning the material.

As a physicist, I've passed courses on rigorous math like mathematical analysis, linear algebra, etc. But I never had an ambition to learn it deeply - I just wanted to understand the concepts and learn to use math as a tool. So, if I could solve, say, differential equations arising in physics, I was satisfied, despite not remembering all the assumptions that go into the techniques. Sure, for the math exams, I had to do some rigorous proofs, but I was only half-remembering them at the exams, filling the details as I was constructing the proof.

The optimization self-study is quite different beast from physics. You never do the actuall practical problem-solving - there are solvers for problems and my job is to formulate the problem in a form the solver can understand, which I can do just fine. So learning by problem solving is fairly problematic - the exercises usually include proofs of this or that, but despite doing them, I keep forgetting most of the assumptions fairly quickly.

I know how to learn physics and the intuition for doing it, but I am quite lost when it comes to abstract rigorous math. So I guess my question is - how do you self-study rigorous math? And what would you recommend to focus on during my self-study of optimization methods and the theory?",No-Score9153,1755121239.0,48,0.88,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1mphjmk/selfstudy_of_optimization_from_mathematical/,/r/math/comments/1mphjmk/selfstudy_of_optimization_from_mathematical/,math,True,False,False,False,False,,False

1mod2mw,How to stay motivated in mathematics?,"I only recently started to enjoy mathematics. Prior to that, I've been terrible at it, hence heavily disliking it because everyone around me seemed to excel in it. So I felt left out, and it was a terrible feeling. 

However, my point is that in recent years. After a series of situations, I've grown to favor mathematics. The issue is: I don't know how to maintain it long term. 

Because math is such a niche interest, in a way. I can't tell anyone about it and not look like a nerd/trying to make myself stand out. Like indirectly telling someone ""Yeah. I like numbers. Complicated stuff you wouldn't understand."" Which isn't the vibe I'm aiming to give. 

So I can't really nerd out about it. Even if I do find someone who shares the same interest. There's a feeling of comparison within me that rooted from years of being bad at it. I feel inadequate whenever around someone who likes mathematics as well, thinking ""I'm just a rookie in comparison. And don't know as much as the other person does."" 

Hence all of this is really making it hard to stay consistent in practicing, as much as I love mathematics. It's like a double edged sword for me. I love it because it is complicated, interesting, and in a way therapeutic once figured out. But also disheartening, to know that I am not nearly as good as I want to be in my own high standards.

This would be very sad as only ξ and ζ are ahead in my tier list of Greek letters most satisfying to write down.

1mnfys2,Learning Geometric Group Theory as an Analyst,"Hello all! I'm interested in learning some geometric group theory as it turns out to have some important relations to my advisor's work, which focuses on the number-theoretic aspects of the Markoff equation and its relatives (so-called ""strong approximation"" and ""superstrong approximation""). Stylistically, I tend to be most at home doing hard analysis, especially in a discrete setting, such as in analytic number theory, discrete harmonic analysis, and some extremal combinatorics, but I have studied some algebra seriously, especially algebraic geometry (I have worked through the first 17 chapters of Vakil, so I am totally comfortable with universal properties and with sheaves, and can speak semi-intelligently about schemes). However, I have very limited background in other forms of geometry (more on that later). I am currently working through ""Office Hours with a Geometric Group Theorist,"" and plan to work through portions of ""A Primer on Mapping Class Groups"" this coming semester in conjunction with a course on related topics; I have also been told about Clara Löh's book on Geometric Group Theory as a good intro. Here are my questions:

* As mentioned before, my geometry is not that good: I have never taken a course on differential geometry, and have only taken a basic course on algebraic topology (covering fundamental groups and covering spaces in the first semester, then homology and cohomology in the second; I have come to terms with the Galois correspondence between covering spaces and fundamental groups, but still find (co)homology somewhat mysterious). To what degree will that get in my way learning geometric group theory, and when and how should I fill in the gaps?
* Are there sources you recommend that focus on geometric group theory that might be particularly friendly to someone with an analysis brain? 
* Are there pieces of analysis I should make an effort to learn as they find important application in geometric group theory? For instance, I am currently working through a book on Functional Analysis by Einsiedler and Ward which covers Kazhdan's Property (T). I also know of notes by Vaes and Wasilewski on functional analysis which focus on discrete groups, a book by Bekka, de la Harp, and Valette on property (T), and Lubotzky's book on Discrete Groups, Expanding Graphs, and Invariant Measures.
* Finally, is there a source you would recommend specifically for learning about character varieties and dynamics on them? My advisor's work and my work can be very nicely phrased as a discrete version of dynamics on character varieties, but I barely know this perspective.

1mndi63,Grothendieck on 'the capacity to be alone'.,"""In those critical years I learned how to be alone. \[But even\] this formulation doesn't really capture my meaning. I didn't, in any literal sense learn to be alone, for the simple reason that this knowledge had never been unlearned during my childhood. It is a basic capacity in all of us from the day of our birth. However these three years of work in isolation \[1945–1948\], when I was thrown onto my own resources, following guidelines which I myself had spontaneously invented, instilled in me a strong degree of confidence, unassuming yet enduring, in my ability to do mathematics, which owes nothing to any consensus or to the fashions which pass as law....By this I mean to say: to reach out in my own way to the things I wished to learn, rather than relying on the notions of the consensus, overt or tacit, coming from a more or less extended clan of which I found myself a member, or which for any other reason laid claim to be taken as an authority. This silent consensus had informed me, both at the lycée and at the university, that one shouldn't bother worrying about what was really meant when using a term like ""volume,"" which was ""obviously self-evident,"" ""generally known,"" ""unproblematic,"" etc....It is in this gesture of ""going beyond,"" to be something in oneself rather than the pawn of a consensus, the refusal to stay within a rigid circle that others have drawn around one—it is in this solitary act that one finds true creativity. All others things follow as a matter of course.

Since then I've had the chance, in the world of mathematics that bid me welcome, to meet quite a number of people, both among my ""elders"" and among young people in my general age group, who were much more brilliant, much more ""gifted"" than I was. I admired the facility with which they picked up, as if at play, new ideas, juggling them as if familiar with them from the cradle—while for myself I felt clumsy, even oafish, wandering painfully up an arduous track, like a dumb ox faced with an amorphous mountain of things that I had to learn (so I was assured), things I felt incapable of understanding the essentials or following through to the end. Indeed, there was little about me that identified the kind of bright student who wins at prestigious competitions or assimilates, almost by sleight of hand, the most forbidding subjects.

In fact, most of these comrades who I gauged to be more brilliant than I have gone on to become distinguished mathematicians. Still, from the perspective of thirty or thirty-five years, I can state that their imprint upon the mathematics of our time has not been very profound. They've all done things, often beautiful things, in a context that was already set out before them, which they had no inclination to disturb. Without being aware of it, they've remained prisoners of those invisible and despotic circles which delimit the universe of a certain milieu in a given era. To have broken these bounds they would have had to rediscover in themselves that capability which was their birthright, as it was mine: the capacity to be alone.""

European Journal of Combinaotrics ranks higher than DM. (It coincides with the numbers seven and one, as it is harder to publish in better journal.)

1mn1jk9,De Rahm Cohomology is mind blowing,"Ive been trying to understand manifold-calculous this summer and tried reading as much as I can about it and practice, just in hope to make sense of De Rahm Cohomology. At the beginning I sort of had geometric intuition for what's going on, but later on manifold calculous became too weird for me, so I just remembered things without fully processing what they mean.

Now I got to De Rahm Cohomology with only hope to clear things out, and I wasn't at all disappointed.

After wasting my whole last summer on algebraic topology (I love you Hatcher), cohomology still didn't click in as such a general thing as I see it now. I saw homology as a measure of holes in a space, and cohomology as a super neat invariant that solves a lot of problems. But now I think the why have clicked in.

I now have this sort of intuition saying that cohomology measures how ""far"" is some sequence with a sort of boundary map from being exact.

In other words, how far is the condition of being a boundary from being the condition of having a (nontrivial) boundary.

It's clear that when the two conditions are the same, then both the algebraic and calculus induced invariants are 0. And that as we add more and more options for the conditions to diverge, we're making the cohomologies bigger and bigger.

Really makes me wonder how much can one generalize cohomology. I've heard of generalized cohomology theories, but it seemed weird to generalize such a paculiar measure ""the quotient of image over kernel of bluh bluh bluh cochains of dualized homology yada yada"".

But now it makes a lot of sense, and it makes me wonder in which other areas of maths do we have such rich concept of boundary maps that allows us to define a cohomology theory following the same intuition?",Last-Scarcity-3896,1754880129.0,225,0.97,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1mn1jk9/de_rahm_cohomology_is_mind_blowing/,/r/math/comments/1mn1jk9/de_rahm_cohomology_is_mind_blowing/,math,True,False,False,False,False,,False

1mmmmb6,Has generative AI proved any genuinely new theorems?,"I'm generally very skeptical of the claims frequently made about generative AI and LLMs, but the newest model of Chat GPT seems better at writing proofs, and of course we've all heard the (alleged) news about the cutting edge models solving many of the IMO problems. So I'm reconsidering the issue. 

For me, it comes down to this: are these models actually capable of the reasoning necessary for writing real proofs? Or are their successes just reflecting that they've seen similar problems in their training data? Well, I think there's a way to answer this question. If the models actually can reason, then they should be proving genuinely new theorems. They have an encyclopedic ""knowledge"" of mathematics, far beyond anything a human could achieve. Yes, they presumably lack familiarity with things on the frontiers, since topics about which few papers have been published won't be in the training data. But I'd imagine that the breadth of knowledge and unimaginable processing power of the AI would compensate for this.

1mlden1,Question on Analyzing System of PDEs,"Hi, I'm a master graduate who's aiming for PhD in Applied Mathematics. My primary research is in modelling disease outbreak with system of ODEs. While I have known much about the qualitative analysis (like finding equilibrium point, analyzing their stability, bifurcation analysis (there's still much to learn btw), numerical simulation, etc.), I'm curious how this is applied to a system of PDEs, because with system of PDEs, one can explain the disease outbreak not only through time, but also spatially. I've joined a workshop days ago and it gave me some perspective, like the analysis is roughly the same, but there are some adjustment and new concept I learnt. My questions are:

- Should we always find the non-uniform equilibrium or just uniform equilibrium points is enough? I know the uniform equilibrium points are easy to find (just plug u_t=u_x=0), but non uniform equilibrium are hard to find because you have to solve a system of second order ODE
- I've also learn about amplitude equations and variational of parameter. When to use them and what is the interpretation of those?
- Are there any qualitative analysis that I've not know so far? So far I only learnt how to find uniform equilibrium points, their stability, Turing instability, variational parameter, and amplitude equations
- If I have a system of mix PDE/ODE, is the analysis roughly the same?

1mlbw8l,"Heuristics for ""progress"" in a jigsaw puzzle","Hello r/math,

I am a big fan of puzzles, and jigsaw puzzles in particular. Over the past eight months I have been working on a particularly challenging one (the end near), which gave me plenty of time to think about what I am doing with my life. Oh, also about math.

I wanted a heuristic to determine how much progress I made on the puzzle during a particular session. Here is my suggestion.

Each piece of the puzzle has a certain number of neighbors (in a typical layout, corners have two, edge pieces have three and any other piece has four). When you just start out, you don't know yet which pieces are adjacent. When you find two pieces that fit together, let's call that a ""known neighbor"".

My heuristic for the progress in the puzzle is the total number of known neighbors, relative to the total number of neighbors.

We have to be a little bit careful with double counting, because ""being neighbors"" is symmetric. When you have two pieces A and B which are neighbors, then you can either count it as one neighbor relation (A and B are neighbors) or as two (A is neighbor of B, and B is neighbor of A). The two choices are of course equivalent. From a mathematical perspective, the first option makes a lot more sense because it absorbs the symmetry  but when I want to count my progress for the day, I personally prefer the second option for the very pragmatic reason that the numbers are bigger and ""I found ten neighbors today"" sounds better than ""I found five neighbors"".

I'm going to stick with the first version of counting them. Let's look at some examples:

- I find two individual pieces, and they fit together. This is one known neighbor.
- I have two pairs (A_1|B_1) and (A_2|B_2), and I notice that A_1 fits into A_2 and B_1 fits into B_2. This is two known neighbors
- if we have the setup from before, but this time B_2 fits into A_1, then that's only one known neighbor
- if I have a hole which is exactly the size of a single piece and I fill that hole, then I determine all four of the piece's neighbors. So that counts as four

I believe this heuristic captures the different kinds of ""progressing"" in a puzzle relatively well. Are there any other heuristics? Which aspects did I forget?

Something that this heuristic fails to consider is what I can only call ""known non-neighbors"". For instance, unless my puzzle only has four pieces, the corners are guaranteed not to be neighbors ever. This information about how many potential neighbors a piece has is not considered in the system I explained above.
Another place where it breaks down is puzzles which are not ""traditionally"" shaped. These modern puzzles with weirdly shaped pieces and overlapping edges can't be described with the above heuristic, because a priori I don't know how many neighbors a piece has. Although I can still count how many known neighbors I have, but without the total number, that number is not very meaningful.",Zorkarak,1754699773.0,16,0.88,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1mlbw8l/heuristics_for_progress_in_a_jigsaw_puzzle/,/r/math/comments/1mlbw8l/heuristics_for_progress_in_a_jigsaw_puzzle/,math,True,False,False,False,False,,False

Most of the time this system of equations (resulting from Lagrange Multipliers) can become quite messy from a computational perspective: non linear and/or transcendental stuff.

1mk4pgf,"""path-dependency"" of math. Hello, i have a stupid question (not a mathematician in any way)","So, I am studying a bit of math online.   
My question is: do you think that mathematics is a ""path-dependent"" science? 

A very stupid example: The Pythagorean theorem is ubiquous in the math i'm studying. I do not know if its validity is confined to euclidean geometry. 

  
Now i'm studying vectors etc. in the space. the distance is an application of Pythagorean theorem, or at least it resembles it. 

  
Do you think that mathematicians, when starting to develop n-dimensional spaces, have defined distance in  a manner that is congruent to the earlier-known  Pythagorean theorem because they had that concept , or  do you think that that concept is, say, ""natural"" and ubiquous like the fibonacci's code? And so its essence is reflected in anything that is developed? 

Are they programming more difficult codes from earlier-given theorems, or are they discovering ""codes"" that are in fact natural - does the epistemiological aspect coincide with the ontological one perhaps. 

Do we have books - something like the Geneaology of Morality by Nietzche, but for mathematical concepts? 

Sorry if this is the wrong sub, or if the question is a bit naive or uselessly philosophical.

1mjwfh4,Structure of certain type of permutations,"Let n∈N be an even number and τ ,ρ ∈ S_n be two permutations such that τ is the product of n/2 disjoint cycles of length 2 and ρ=(0,1,2,...,n-1)^t for some t ∈ Z. I want to find all the possible factorisations in product of disjoint cycles of the elements of the form σ=ρτ, some recursive law that they obey (with respect to n), the orders that those can have or any result like that.

I already know how do they work for t=n/2 (and obviously for t=0). For that case you can get any permutation which, when factored, results into a bunch of pairs of permutations of the same order (the two permutations of each pair have the same order). All of those can be constructed quite easily, and the fact that no more can be achieved follows from the fact that ρ is also a product of 2-cycles, and numbers in the same cycle in ρ behave symmetrically in ρτ, and can't be in the same cycle in the product (requires some observation).

I also know that the results are the same for all t that have the same greatest common divisor with n.

The case of n being odd (and thus τ having exactly 1 fixed point) also has some interest, but I already know how to extend the results from n even to this case

Hey everyone, I am a current math graduate student who focuses on nonlinear dynamics and control theory. I have recently built this interactive and customizable 3d phase space simulation. It has 18 different systems of ODEs, such as characteristic systems like the Lorenz system, but also many more lesser known systems. The graphics look best on larger screens (desktops), and looks decent on phone. For laptops, sometimes if the screen is too small, you can get stuck inside the simulation canvas and cannot scroll out, I am currently working on fixing this. I have several features such as choosing from 17 color palettes for the trajectory colors, adjustable parameters (I tested all of these parameter ranges and tried to restrict the parameters to make sure the systems don't escape to infinity, so it's like a little playground for building your own unique system). Furthermore, you can change the simulation speed, toggle the spheres displays', toggle the dimensional grids, and screenshot the canvas. You can generate some truly fascinating systems that exhibit very geometrically rich behavior. You can access the website [here](https://nasser-mohammed.github.io/simulations/programs/3D%20Phase%20Space/index.html). Below are some examples of the systems you can visualize. The program allows you to move around the space freely so you can explore these systems however you want. If anyone has suggestions or comments please feel free to let me know. Below are some images, and on the bottom are links to some videos I took of them in 3D space. Hope you enjoy!

1mjm3a5,Unprovability of GCH is blowing my mind again,"When I first learned that it can't be proven to be true or false I was taken aback. Like how is that possible? But learning about it, realizing it actually just means ZFC doesn't disallow either assumption and you can either take ZFC+GCH or ZFC-GCH calmed me down a bit. Okay, differently constructed axioms, different results, that's fine. I can think of it kind of like whether I allow square root of -1 determines whether I have C or am restricted to R. It's still a very interesting observation, but fundamentals of my understanding aren't crumbling under my feet.

But suppose you take ZFC-GCH. Does that mean there exists a set that you can't biject with integers because it's too big, and you can't biject it with all reals because it's too small? With my very limited understanding of GCH, I don't think -GCH necessarily forces this particular cardinality to exist, but the fact remains that it implies existence of something like that: a cardinality strictly between aleph_n and aleph_n+1. Now maybe if I understood cardinalities beyond that of the reals, this fact would be less of a surprise, but then again maybe not. For now trying to think about any such cardinality I have to rely on my understanding of these two that I do understand. So suppose there is a subset of the reals that's bigger than the integers and yet can't be bijected with all reals. What could it possibly be? I mean, the existence of it implies you can describe it, right? At least you should be able to provide a number of examples and counterexamples of members of that set.

But ZFC+GCH is just as correct. So what happens to this set then? Intuition says it would become bijectable with the reals / the higher aleph, which might be incorrect, but more importantly: the bijection itself! It becomes illegal somehow. Which makes me think GCH, despite being conceived to answer questions about set cardinalities might involve a lot more.

I don't know why it suddenly started to bother me. The thought came to me and is threatening my understanding of math. That I don't understand something like the complex arcsin doesn't bother me much, that is in some sense too fancy and yet clearly mundane. Understanding how stuff fits into boxes feels something one should understand instinctively, and when you're confused about it, it feels like some fundamental part of your mind is threatened. First time learning about countable vs uncountable or various infinity paradoxes is something we can probably all remember being fascinated by. You can probably remember questioning things yourself and eventually coming to understand them and looking down on the morons who don't. So whether this reads like gradeschool homework to you, or you are wondering the same thing, or even if you're like ""what's GCH?"", I think you can sympathize with my perplexedness and my quest for demystification here. Oh, and then there's the ""there's more infinities than there's anything else"" thing.

1mjgmrm,Does approximating the derivative in Newton's Method limit the precision of the calculated roots?,"Hai yall :3

Title deserves some explanation. A program that I was writing required, as one step, to find an approximate root of a certain holomorphic function. In the program, I implemented Newton's Method with three iterations, but in place of the derivative, I used a secant approximation calculated as $\\frac{f(x+\\frac{h}{2}-f(x-\\frac{h}{2})}{h}$ (where h was hardcoded to 0.01). However, for the purposes of the discussion below, I'd like to ignore programmatic considerations such as floating point precision, as I wish to approach this from a purely mathematical point of view.

This approximation was sufficient for my program, but it got me thinking: Would such an approach (in particular, the fact that I've hardcoded h to a particular value) limit the precision of the calculated root? It is my understanding that other root finding algorithms which don't require a derivative (such as Steffensen's Method) possess the property that, under sufficiently nice conditions, it will always converge (according to wikipedia, the number of correct decimal places will double each iteration). Is that property lost by hardcoding an h value for the approximate derivative in the method I described above? In that case, would the method reach a certain point where repeated iterations will stop improving the approximate root, because the error between the approximate derivative and the actual one becomes relevant?

1mjf6zu,Need brain-power on a wild permutation-optimization puzzle,"Hey everyone!

I’m stuck on a *combinatorial-optimization* task that looks simple on paper but is driving me nuts IRL.

        # X is a fixed 50×100 float matrix
        z = 100 * X[:, I[0]]

        return np.sum(z**2)          # ‖z‖² after 100 steps
    

* The first column blows up `z` by 100×.
* Every next column adds a sinusoid depending on current `z`.
* Objective = final 𝓁₂-norm² of that 50-dim vector.

Brute force is hopeless (100! ≈ 9.4×10¹⁵⁷).  
So far I tried:

* double-beam search → greedy tail
* Δ-update Simulated Annealing with swap + segment-reverse + block-insert

1miydm0,Why does the math of gerrymandering have to be so complicated?,"I’ve been thinking about this off and on for years, and have lately come to (what seems to me) an elementary, mathematically rigorous test for determining whether a map is gerrymandered:

*A map is gerrymandered if there exists another map with the same fixed boundaries [i.e. state borders], number of districts, and population per district, with a lesser total length of district boundaries.*

[Edit: All I’m talking about here is a way to measure the relative gerrymandering of two maps, taking as a given that there are other factors (including the VRA) that would have to be satisfied.]

I came to this by thinking about how gerrymandered maps have long, thin protrusions. That’s the case  because in order to crack and pack a population into outcome-determined districts, one literally has to draw longer district borders around the populations whose votes are being manipulated. It isn’t just that the districts sprawl, its that the district borders gig-zag all over the place!

But those gig-zags can be progressively smoothed out to swap equal numbers of voters back into more compactified districts, always with less total measure of district boundary. In fact, as districts become optimally compact, the resulting maps should begin to resemble a Voronoi diagram.

1mier2z,"No, AI will not replace mathematicians.","There has been a lot of discussions on this topic and I think there is a fundamental problem with the idea that some kind of artificial mathematicians will replace actual mathematicians in the near future. 



This discussion has been mostly centered around the rise of powerful LLM's which can engage accurately in mathematical discussions and develop solutions to IMO level problems, for example. As such, I will focus on LLM's as opposed to some imaginary new technology, with unfalsifiable superhuman ability, which is somehow always on the horizon. 

  
The reason AI will never replace human mathematicians is that **mathematics is about human understanding.** 

  
Suppose that two LLM's are in conversation (so that there is no need for a prompter) and they naturally come across and write a proof of a new theorem. What is next? They can make a paper and even post it. But for whom? Is it really possible that it's just produced for other LLM's to read and build off of? 

  
In a world where the mathematical community has vanished, leaving only teams of LLM's to prove theorems, what would mathematics look like? Surely, it would become incomprehensible after some time and mathematics would effectively become a list of mysteriously true and useful statements, which only LLM's can understand and apply. 

  
And people would blindly follow these laws set out by the LLM's and would cease natural investigation, as they wouldn't have the tools to think about and understand natural quantitative processes. In the end, humans cease all intellectual exploration of the natural world and submit to this metal oracle.

  
I find this conception of the future to be ridiculous. There is a key assumption in the above, and in this discussion, that **in the presence of a superior intelligence, human intellectual activity serves no purpose**. This assumption is wrong. The point of intellectual activity is not to come to true statements. It is to better understand the natural and internal worlds we live in. As long as there are people who want to understand, there will be intellectuals who try to. 

  
For example, chess is frequently brought up as an activity where AI has already become far superior to human players. (Furthermore, I'd argue that AI has essentially maximized its role in chess. The most we will see going forward in chess is marginal improvements, which will not significantly change the relative strength of engines over human players.) 

  
Similar to mathematics, the point of chess is for humans to compete in a game. Have chess professionals been replaced by different models of Stockfish which compete in professional events? Of course not. Similarly, when/if AI becomes similarly dominant in mathematics, the community of mathematicians is more likely to pivot in the direction of comprehending AI results than to disappear entirely.

1mi5xhh,New math productivity tool: Mathpad,"**Hello mathematicians!**

I'm Magne, a physicist and maker from the UK. I built a specialized keyboard that removes much of the friction of typing math symbols outside of LaTeX, like in collaborative google docs, powerpoint presentations, or when chatting with colleagues over email or slack/teams/whatever.

The usual workarounds (searching and copying from the internet, copying from character maps, memorizing alt-codes, or clicking through symbol menus) felt clunky and backwards. Why shouldn't I just be able to type γ, ∇ and ∫ as easily as I type A, B, and C?

So, I built Mathpad. It has dedicated keys for 120 Unicode math symbols. Press a key, get the Unicode symbol directly: α, ∇, ∫, ∀, ∃, ≈, etc. It works whereever you can type text and does not require any software  to work (except on Windows...).

**Some situations where Mathpad shines:**

* Commenting code, especially algorithms (I do this constantly)
* Writing plaintext documentation and README files
* Emails and forums
* Quick notes and scratch work that don't warrant firing up a full LaTeX document

**This is not about replacing LaTeX!** LaTeX remains the gold standard for mathematical typesetting and always will be. This is just for those everyday situations where LaTeX isn't practical or available.

I've worked on this thing for three years, prototyping and refining it until it actually felt useful. Made it open source since the problem seems common enough that others might want to build their own variants.

I'm selling Mathpad on Crowd Supply until 11th of September if anyone want one. Orders will be shipped out around end of November.

For which real values of x is x^x a rational number?

x = 1 → 1^1 = 1

x = sqrt(4) = 2 → 2^2 = 4

x = 1/2 → (1/2)^(1/2) ≈ 0.707...

However, for irrational x, the situation becomes more subtle.
Expressions like sqrt(2)^sqrt(2) fall into the domain of results such as the Gelfond–Schneider theorem.

So the questions are:

Is there a known classification of all real x such that x^x is rational?

Are there known irrational values of x where x^x is rational (or even algebraic)?

That said, I’m curious how someone with deep mathematical intuition might begin to think *towards* formalizing or modeling these sorts of abstract notions — even if only metaphorically.

Two thoughts I’ve had:

1. **Geometric arrangements of well-formed expressions** — Imagine a ""space"" in which syntactically valid expressions (e.g., algebraic, logical, or even linguistic) are treated as geometric entities and can be arranged or transformed spatially. This is entirely speculative, but could there be a lens (algebraic geometry, topoi, category theory?) through which this idea might begin to make formal sense?
2. **Mathematics as an information metric** — In a Platonic or informational ontology, where constants like π, φ, e, etc., are not just numbers but structural ""anchors/fixed points"" in an abstract reality, could mathematics be understood as the emergent structure from these invariants? What’s the most charitable or even fun way to *begin modeling* this? If someone could answer me, why do constants appear on seemingly unrelated places sometimes, for example for riemman zeta (2,4,6) when there are no notions of circles there?

I know both thoughts could be completely non-sensical, I am not looking for feedback on whether they are correctly defined, I don't know how to define stuff eitherways. I do want to see if there even is a discussion to be had based on the statements. Always loved to define weird shit I can't solve.

For vector space again, do you think in terms of the vectors generating a space or think of numbers of coordinate to specify a point in a space. 

Which way of thinking is more intuitive to you. I would like to think of the ""gluing way"" as more temporal and the measuring way of thinking as more spatial. I remember reading one paper in brain science on how people construct mental model of space and time in navigation and as embodied.

1mfl9j3,What are the limitations of finitism in metamathematics?,"Hi! To start off, I don't really have any formal education in pure mathematics—I just really love the subject a lot and I have specifically been self-studying metamathematics for quite a while. I've taken a liking to Hilbert's Program. The idea of formalizing all of mathematics and, using only finitist reasoning, proving that these formalizations have the properties we desire (completeness, consistency, decidability, etc.), sounds like an ideal endeavor to make do with controversial things like non-constructive reasoning  and the appeal to completed infinities, since they can simply be recast as finite strings of symbols deemed legitimate as formal proofs using only immediate and intuitive logic, importantly without appeal to their semantic interpretations.

I'm aware that Hilbert's Program fell apart due to Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems and the undecidability of arithmetic, but what I'd like to point out is that Gödel's theorems, despite their rigor, was based on purely finitist reasoning. I imagine that this very fact is why the theorems were particularly devastating for Hilbert; had the theorems been based on controversial/non-finitist mechanics, they wouldn’t have dealt as compelling a blow as they did. I was interested to find out the same for the undecidability of arithmetic—which states that no algorithm exists that can decide whether an arbitrary first-order arithmetic statement follows from the axioms, and this is where I encountered some hurdles. Interestingly, the notion of algorithms extends beyond primitive recursion, which is generally understood as an upper bound of finitism. It therefore seems to me that proofs of undecidability are not finitistically acceptable—which doesn't feel right, since the notion of a ""procedure"" feels immediate and intuitive, and that undecidability appears to be an observable phenomenon in many systems that it must have some sort of backing that does not make an appeal to controversial methods of reasoning.

I also find other examples intriguing, such as non-primitive total recursive functions (e.g. the Ackermann function). These are technically beyond what primitive recursion can express, but they nonetheless always halt after a finite number of steps. Shouldn't they then be accepted into finitism? 

This makes me think that perhaps finitism could be extended to broader notions, and the restriction to primitive recursion that is normally associated with it is more of a limitation of what formal systems in general can express, when informal reasoning can picture other processes as finitary in nature. An example of this is the fact that formal systems don't have a way to account for the passage of time. A general recursive function can either only be assigned a value or be undefined, which are final and finished states. There is no third option where we can say that the computation is still in progress, whereas we can in our informal brains. In this kind of thought, there is no problem seeing non-halting processes, or processes with an unknown number of steps, as still finitary, by looking at them as not being finished 'yet', since after all, each step of the computation is a finite and intuitive instruction. This all sounds quite naive, and I'm pretty sure it doesn't really lead to anything remarkable, but it's me taking a shot in the dark.

I find that I can make either one of the following conclusions.

* Computation is not a finitist concept. Therefore, it's impossible to reason about decision problems using Hilbert's prescribed ways of metamathematical discourse. Committing to finitism in metamathematics leaves us no choice but to abandon the question of the decidability of arithmetic altogether, as well as similar decision problems in general. In this case, is the undecidability of arithmetic similar to other metamathematical results such as Gödel's Completeness Theorem, Löwenheim-Skolem Theorem, and others, in a way that they require stronger and more controversial metatheories than primitive recursive arithmetic?
* Finitism can be extended beyond primitive recursion—primitive recursion is accepted to be the formalization of finitism, but only because informal conceptualizations of finitism that cover broader notions still simply cannot be formalized. In this kind of thought, we can still reason about computation and think about decision problems (I'm unsure about this yet). In this case, is there a pragmatic version of finitism similar to this that I can perhaps look into?

I'm pretty sure there may be something I'm missing, and hope to have a discussion to shed more light on it.",mjtsquared,1754122448.0,23,0.79,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1mfl9j3/what_are_the_limitations_of_finitism_in/,/r/math/comments/1mfl9j3/what_are_the_limitations_of_finitism_in/,math,True,False,False,False,False,,False

1mf8x12,"Linear algebra: how much of a problem would this non-standard notation be, in a textbook?","I'm working on a set of lecture notes which might become a textbook. There are some parts of standard linear algebra notation that I think add a little confusion. I'm considering the following bits of non-standard notation, and I'm wondering how much of a problem y'all think it will cause my students in later classes when the notation is different. I'll order them from least disruptive to most disruptive (in my opinion):

1. *p × n* instead of *m × n* for the size of a matrix. The reason is that *m* and *n* sound similar when spoken.
2. *Ax = y* instead of *Ax = b*. This way it lines up with the *f(x) = y* precedent. And later on, having the standard notation for basis vectors be *{b\_1, ..., b\_n}* is confusing, because now when you find *B*-coordinates for *x*, the  *Ax = b* equation gets shuffled around, with *b\_i* basis vectors in place of *A* and *x* in place of *b*. This has confused lots of students in the past.
3. *Span* instead of *Subspace.* Here I mean a ""Span"" is just a set that can be written as the span of some vectors. I'm still going to mention subspaces, and the standard definition of them, and show that spans are subspaces. And 95% of the class is about R^n, where all subspaces are spans, and I want students to think of them that way. So most of the time I'll use the terminology *Null Span, Column Span, Row Span.*

So yeah, I think each of these will help a few students in my class, but I'm wondering how much you think it will hurt them in later classes.

EDIT: math formatting. Couldn't get latex to render. Hopefully it's readable. Also I fixed a couple typos.

EDIT 2: I wanna add a little justification for ""Span.""  I've had tons of students in the past who just don't get what a subspace is. Like, they think a subspace of R^2 is anything with area (like the unit disk). But they understand just fine that Spans, in R^2, are either just the origin, or a line, or all of R^2. I'm de-emphasizing vector spaces other than R^n, putting them off till the end of the class. So all of the subspaces we're talking about are either going to be described as spans anyway (like the column space), or are going to be the null space, in which case answering the question ""span of *what*?"" is an important skill.",ave_63,1754083941.0,76,0.88,58,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1mf8x12/linear_algebra_how_much_of_a_problem_would_this/,/r/math/comments/1mf8x12/linear_algebra_how_much_of_a_problem_would_this/,math,True,False,False,False,False,,False

By “hard,” I don’t mean routine textbook problems I’m talking about Olympiad-level questions or anything that requires deep creativity and insight.

When I face such a problem, I find myself just staring at it for hours. I try all the techniques I know but often none of them seem to work. It starts to feel like I’m just blindly trying things, hoping something randomly leads somewhere. Usually, it doesn’t, and I give up.

This makes me wonder: What do actual mathematicians do when they face difficult, even unsolved, problems? I’m not talking about the Riemann Hypothesis or Millennium Problems, but even “small” open problems that require real creativity. Do they also just try everything they know and hope for a breakthrough? Or is there a more structured way to make progress?

1meearp,Combinatorics and symmetry groups,"Hi, I'm trying to describe a kind of n-dimensional generalization of [necklaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necklace_(combinatorics\)) in combinatorics. If you picture a regular polygon with each vertex labeled with a character (or color, etc), you can model rotations of that polygon in 2 dimensions with cyclic shifts of a string of those characters — that's a necklace. But consider labeling the vertices of a cube in the same way. In 3 dimensions, rotation has more degrees of freedom, so it's not obvious what operations on such a string would correspond to possible rotations. (Or what kind of structure you'd need, rather than a string, for a set of 3 kinds of orthogonal cyclic shifts to work.) You could work it out through brute force, but what about some other regular polyhedron with different rotational symmetry? What about a 4-dimensional polychoron? And so on… Also, you could extend the problem to other symmetries besides rotational.

I know that in the case of a cube, rotational symmetry is described by the octahedral symmetry group, but I'm not sure how to bridge the gap between descriptions of symmetry groups and descriptions that admit a combinatoric treatment. (Not an expert in either, so quite possibly I'm just not familiar with the right terms to look up.) Any suggestions on reference material or terminology that could be relevant?

* Repeat until you are only left with the final shape.

While doing that, I found that for the icosahedron, I need to do the extrusion 7 times, which I found strange.  
I redid the exercise using the same method for the Tetrahedron, the cube and the dodecahedron

D4 : 2 extrusions

D6 : 2 extrusions

D12 : 3 extrusions

I don't understand the pattern. I guess it's something to do with pairs of parallel/ perpendicular faces and edges, but still 7 doesn't make much sense.

1mebqoz,"Formalizing the limitations of AGI through recursion theory, complexity theory, and information theory","I am having a lot of trouble explaining my question here, but I think the main question is as follows:

As someone who has studied classical recursion theory, complexity theory, and information theory, there is a sort of 'smell' that something is very off about claims of Artificial General Intelligence, and specifically what LLM models are capable of doing (see below for some of these arguments as to why something seems off).

But I am not sure if its just me. I am wondering if there been any attempts at seriously formalizing these ideas to get practical limits on modern AI?

**EDIT FOR CLARITY: PLEASE READ BEFORE COMMENTING**

The existing comments completely avoid the main question of: **What are the formal practical limitations of modern AI techniques.** Comparison with humans is not the main point, although it is a useful heuristic for guiding the discussion. Please refrain from saying things like ""humans have the same limitations"" because thats not the point: sure humans may have the same limitations, but they are still limitations, and AI is being used in different contexts that we wouldn't typically expect a human to do. So it is helpful to know what the limitations are so we know how to use it effectively.

I agree that recursion theory a la carte is not a \_practical\_ limitation as I say below, my question is, how do we know if and where it effects practical issues.

Finally, **this is a math sub, not an AI or philosophy sub.** Although this definitely brushes up against philosophy, please, as far as you are able, **try to keep the discussion mathematical.** I am asking for *mathematical answers.*

**Motivation for the question:**

I work as a software engineer and study mathematics in my free time (although I am in school for mathematics part time), and as an engineer, the way mathematicians think about things and the way engineers think about things is totally different. Abstract pure mathematics is not convincing to most engineers, and you need to 'ground it' in practical numbers to convince them of anything.

To be honest, I am not so bothered by this perse, but the lack of concern in the general conversation surrounding Artificial Intelligence for classical problems in recursion theory/complexity theory/information theory feels very troubling to me.

As mathematicians, are these problems as serious as I think they are? I can give some indication of the kinds of things I mean:

1. **Recursion theory**: Classical recursion theoretic problems such as the halting problem and godel's incompleteness theorems. I think the halting problem is not necessarily a huge problem against AI, mostly because it is reasonable to think that humans are potentially as bad at the halting problem as an AI would be (I am not so sure though, see the next two points). But I think Gödel's Incompleteness theorem is a bit more of a problem for AGI. Humans seem to be able to know that the Gödel sentence is 'true' in some sense, even though we can't prove it. AFAIK this seems to be a pretty well known argument, but IMO it has the least chance of convincing anyone as it is highly philosophical in nature and is, to put it lightly 'too easy'. It doesn't really address what we see AI being capable of today. Although I personally find this pretty convincing, there needs to be more 'meat' on the bones to convince anyone else. Has anyone put more meat on the bones?
2. **Information Theory**: I think for me the closest to a 'practical' issue I can come up with is the relationship between AI and and information. There is the data processing inequality for Shannon information, which essentially states that the Shannon information contained in the training data cannot be increased by processing it through a training algorithm. There is a similar, but less robust, result for Kolmogorov information, which says that the information can't be increased by more than a constant (which is afaik, essentially the information contained in the training algorithm itself). When you combine these with the issues in recursion theory mentioned above, this seems to indicate to me that AI will 'almost certainly' add noise to our ideal (because it won't be able to solve the halting problem so must miss information we care about), and thus it can't ""really"" do much better than whats in the training data. This is a bit unconvincing as a 'gotcha' for AI because it doesn't rule out the possibility of simply 'generating' a 'superhuman' amount of training data. As an example, this is essentially what happens with chess and go algorithms. That said, at least in the case of Kolmogorov information, what this really means is that chess and go are relatively low information games. There are higher information things that are practical though. Anything that goes outside of the first rung of the arithmetic hierarchy (such as the halting function) will have more information, and as a result it is very possible that humans will be better at telling e.g. when a line of thinking has an infinite loop in it. Even if we are Turing machines (which I have no problem accepting, although I remain unsure), there is an incredible amount information stored in our genetics (i.e. our man made learning algorithms are competing with evolution, which has been running for a lot longer), so we are likely more robust in this sense.
3. **Epistemic/Modal logic and knowledge/belief**. I think one of the most convincing things for me personally that first order logic isn't everything is the classic ""[Blue Eyes Islander Puzzle](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2008/02/05/the-blue-eyed-islanders-puzzle/)"". Solving this puzzle essentially requires a form of higher order modal logic (the semantics of which, even if you assume something like Henkin semantics, is incredibly complicated, due to its use of both an unbounded number of knowledge agents and time). There are also many other curiosities in this realm such as Raymond Smullyan's [Logicians who reason about themselves](http://www.tark.org/proceedings/tark_mar19_86/p341-smullyan.pdf), which seem to strengthen Godel's incompleteness theorems as it relates to AI. We don't really want an AI which is an inconsistent thinker (more so than humans, because an AI which lies is potentially more dangerous than a human which does so, at least in the short term), but if it believes it is a consistent thinker, it will be inconsistent. Since we do not really have a definition of 'belief' or 'knowledge' as it relates to AI, this could be completely moot, or it could be very relevant.
4. **Gold's Theorem.** Gold's theorem is a classic result that shows that an AI needs both positive and negative examples to learn anything more complicated than (iirc) a context free language. There are many tasks where we can generate a lot of positive and negative examples, but when it comes to creative tasks, this seems next to impossible without introducing a lot of bias from those choosing the training data, as they would have to define what 'bad' creativity means. E.g. defining what 'bad' is in terms of visual art seems hopeless. The fact that AI can't really have 'taste' beyond that of its trainers is kind of not a 'real' problem, but it does mean that it can't really dominate art and entertainment in the way I think a lot of people believe (people will get bored of its 'style'). Although I have more to say about this, it becomes way more philosophical than mathematical so I will refrain from further comment.
5. **Probability and randomness**. This one is a bit contrived, but I do think that if randomness is a real thing, then there will be problems that AI can't solve without a true source of randomness. For example, there is the 'infinite Rumplestiltskin problem' (I just made up the name). If you have an infinite number of super intelligent imps, with names completely unknown to you, but which are made of strings of a known set of letters, it seems as if it is only possible to guarantee that you guess an infinite number of their names correctly if and only if you guess in a truly random way. If you don't, then the imps, being super intelligent, will  notice whatever pattern you are going to use for your guesses and start ordering themselves in such a way that you always guess incorrectly. If your formalize this, it seems as if the truly random sequence must be a sequence which is not definable (thus way way beyond being computable). Of course, we don't really know if true randomness exists and this little story does not get any closer to this (quantum mechanics does not technically prove this, we just know that either randomness exists or the laws of physics are non-local, but it could very well be that they are non-local). So I don't really think this has much hope of being convincing.

Of these, I think number 2 has the most hope of being translated into 'practical' limits of AI. The no free lunch theorem used Shannon information to show something similar, but the common argument against the no free lunch theorem is to say that there could be a class of 'useful' problems for which AI can be trained efficiently on, and that this class is what we really mean when we talk about general intelligence. Still, I think that information theory combined with recursion theory implies that AI will perform worse (at least in terms of accuracy) than whatever generated its training data most of the time, and especially when the task is complicated (which seems to be the case for me when I try to use it for most complicated problems).

I have no idea if any of these hold up to any scrutiny, but thats why I am asking here. Either way, it does seem to be the case that when taken in totality that there are limits to what AI can do, but have these limits had the degree of formalization that classical recursion theory has had?

Is there anyone (seriously) looking into the possible limits of modern AI from a purely mathematical perspective?",wikiemoll,1753991904.0,0,0.43,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1mebqoz/formalizing_the_limitations_of_agi_through/,/r/math/comments/1mebqoz/formalizing_the_limitations_of_agi_through/,math,True,False,False,False,False,,False

1mdhmmc,Do you think your (PhD) advisor is hands-on or hands-off? Which one would you prefer and do you think it depends on the field?,"Hi everyone,

I was chatting with my friends recently and they are in different fields. In summary, from what I see, it seems that algebraic geometry and number theory professors tend to be more hands-off, whereas combinatorics (e.g., graph theory) professors tend to be more hands-on, such as collaborating/co-authroing on papers with graduate students.

So I was wondering do you think this phenomenon depends on the fields, like algebraic geometry, number theory, topology, discrete math, and so on? Or would you say it has more to do with culture -- I'm in Europe, or Germany to be exact, though said combinatorics professor is also an European.

I would like to evaluate the symmetry of different curves. I have a large number of measurement points from a simulation. In the first step, I generate a curve with evenly distributed x values and interpolate my values from my data set for my corresponding x values.

Now to my question:
I am now calculating the skewness. However, I am not sure whether this can be applied to my problem at all. My values are NOT a statistical distribution. You can think of it as a measured contour. Can I use skewness here, or are there better tools for evaluating the symmetry of a curve? In the end, I need a score to say which curve is the most symmetrical. What I have already considered is to sum up the difference between two values relative to a symmetry axis, but my problem here is where to define the symmetry axis. Everything I find on the internet is either simple analysis or statistics, and I don't think either is the solution to my problem.

I recently watched an interview with Serre where he says that one of the things that allowed him to do so much was his insight to try cohomology in many contexts. He  says, more or less, that he just “just tried the key of cohomology in every door, and some opened"".

From my perspective, cohomology feels like a very technical concept . I can motivate myself to study it because I know it’s powerful and useful, but I still don’t really *see why* it would occur to someone to try it in many context. Maybe once people saw it worked in one place, it felt natural to try it elsewhere? So the expansion of cohomology across diferent areas might have just been a natural process.

1mcfuqo,New discovery? Inscribed and circumscribed spiral,"As shown in this image, the golden spiral slightly exceeds the golden rectangle.

[It is not that noticeable but the golden spiral is not tangent and slightly exceeds the golden rectangle, see the upper corner where it is the most visible](https://preview.redd.it/1lr4my2nvtff1.png?width=1740&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5af1f96d093f06bc514200823a12ede2593ac88)

When I noticed that, I was surprised because of the widespread myth of the golden spiral being allegedly aesthetically pleasing and special. But a spiral that exceeds a rectangle is not satisfying at all so I decided to dig deeper.

Just to clear up some confusion, the Fibonacci spiral, which is made of circular arcs, is not the same as the golden spiral. The former lacks continuous curvature, while the golden spiral is a true logarithmic spiral, a smooth curve with really interesting properties such as self-similarity. If you're into design, you should know that continuous curvature is often considered aesthetic (much like how superellipses are used in UI design over rounded squares). While Fibonacci spiral does not exceed the golden rectangle, the golden spiral definitely does. There is no floating point issue.

This concept of inside spiral extends beyond the golden rectangle. Any rectangle, regardless of its proportions, can give rise to a logarithmic spiral through recursive division. If you keep cutting the rectangle into smaller ones with the same aspect ratio, you will be able to construct a spiral easily. What makes the golden rectangle visually striking is that its subdivisions form perfect squares. But other aspect ratios are just as elegant in their own way. Take the sqrt(2) = 1.414... rectangle: each subdivision can be obtained by just folding each rectangle in half. That’s the principle behind the A-series paper sizes (like A4, A3, etc.), widely used for their practical scalability. Interestingly enough, this ratio is quite close to IMAX 1.43 ratio (cf. the movie Dune), and in my opinion one of the most pleasing aspect ratio.

While exploring this idea, I wondered: what would be the ratio where the spiral remains completely contained within its rectangle? After some calculations, I found that this occurs when the spiral's growth factor equals the zero of the function f(x) = x^(3) ln(x) - pi/2, which is approximately 1.5388620467... (close to the 3:2 aspect ratio used a lot in photography)

[Here is a rectangle with an aspect ratio equal to 1.5388620467... The spiral is perfectly inscribed inside the rectangle](https://preview.redd.it/j0n3miubxtff1.png?width=1740&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a7fd09530e5eb52432255a148351ca39064f843)

Curious whether this number had already been discovered, I did some digging only to find that there is only one result on Google, a paper published in 2021 by a Brazilian author named Spira, a name that fits really well his discovery: [https://rmu.sbm.org.br/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/sites/11/2021/11/RMU-2021\_2\_6.pdf](https://rmu.sbm.org.br/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/sites/11/2021/11/RMU-2021_2_6.pdf)

Although Spira identified the same ratio for the rectangle case before I did, I was inspired to go further. I began exploring if I could find other polygons that can fits entirely a logarithmic spiral. What I discovered was a whole family of equiangular polygons that can form a spiral tiling and contain a logarithmic spiral perfectly, as well as a general equation to generate them:

[The equation to find the growth factor x of a spiral that can be contained in an equiangular n-gon](https://preview.redd.it/mygygvwsytff1.jpg?width=1215&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dd81f5de35ae493554fe003cd93da3f52e2c2147)

If you use this formula with n=4 (rectangle) and p = 1, you'll find x\^3 ln(x) - pi/2 = 0, which is indeed the result Spira and I found to have a spiral fully inscribed in a rectangle. But the formula I found can also be used to generate other equiangular n-gon with its corresponding logarithmic spiral, for example a pentagon (n = 5):

[A logarithmic spiral inside an equiangular pentagon](https://preview.redd.it/nxmyi42j42gf1.png?width=1322&format=png&auto=webp&s=8734632372730a79f18036b199f76ee1f2eeee23)

or an equiangular triangle (n = 3):

[A logarithmic spiral inside an equilateral triangle](https://preview.redd.it/rwhxjll9ztff1.jpg?width=1178&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=82bec67409f1debd873e839f05bfd424365f2b7f)

While Spira did not found those equiangular n-gons, he did something interesting related to isosceles triangle, with a spiral that is both inscribed and circumscribed (much better property than the golden triangle).

[A logarithmic spiral inscribed and circumscribed to an isosceles triangle ](https://preview.redd.it/b6n6jfzmztff1.png?width=636&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab637c3609029582a87d90101ce8d1ab011ab3a2)

The golden rectangle, golden spiral and golden triangle have wikipedia page dedicated to it, while in my opinion they are not that special because a spiral can be made from any rectangle and any isosceles triangle. However, only few polygons can have inscribed and/or circumscribed spiral.

I thought it would be interesting to share it here. I also want to do a YouTube video about it because I think there are a lot of interesting things to say about it, but I might need help to illustrate everything or to even go further in that idea. If someone wants to help me with that, feel free to reach out.

1mbpu52,"Novices: Some of your intuition about infinite sets is not wrong, the problem is pop-math explanations","I've been commenting on a few posts about infinity and infinitesimals lately, and it's reminded me of what I consider to be a problem with how pop educators explain the ""size"" of infinite sets, particularly in explanations of Hilbert's Hotel. (Disclaimer: I'm pulling from memory. I haven’t scoured the internet for every explanation of cardinality.)

After learning the Hilbert hotel explanation, I imagine quite a few people look at the set of even positive integers and feel it's obviously smaller than the set of all positive integers. But the implicit message a novice takes in from the typical YouTube video, or whatever, is that they’ve made “a silly novice mistake”. After all, they were just shown that they are the same size! At best, they might be left in awe of this supposed paradox.

But their intuition is not wrong. The problem is the math communication. Given the obvious difference between the sets, shouldn't a math popularizer see that explanations of Hilbert's hotel can't end with the audience thinking this is the only way to measure a set?

I say explanations of cardinality should end with an additional section showing different measures and letting the audience know that cardinality isn't the only one out there. The audience should leave knowing that the natural density can differentiate between the two examples I gave, and it can also be colloquially said to measure their “size”.

And who knows? Teaching this final section might even set the audience up to predict that something like the dartboard paradox is only ""paradoxical"" because of a confusion about which mathematical measure to use.

Also, is there a way of explaining the definitions in terms of loops, or maybe other structures, in computer programming? It's easy to program a loop that outputs sequential integers and to then accept ""infinity"" in terms of imagining the program running forever.

A Stern Brocot tree to generate the rational numbers can be modeled as a loop within an infinite loop, and with each repetition of the outer loop, there's an increase in the number of times the inner loop repeats.

1mbgpk9,What is a general principle in your field that surprised you?,"Hi everyone, 

Today I wanted to ask kind of a very broad question : What is an example of a very general principle in your field that surprised you for some particular reason. 

It can be because of how deep it is, how general or useful it is, how surprising it is..... Anything goes really. 

Personally, as someone who specializes in probability theory, few things surprised me as much as the concentration of measure phenomenon and for several reasons : 

The first one is that it simply formalizes a very intuitive idea that we have about random variables that have some mean and some variances, the ""lighter"" their tails, the less they will really deviate from their expectation. Plus you get quantitative non asymptotics result regarding the LLN etc.... 

 The second aspect is how general the phenomenon is, of course Hoeffding, Bernstein etc... are specific examples but the general idea that a function of independent random variables that is"" regular"" enough will not behave to differently than it's expectation is very general and powerful. This also tells us numerous fancy things about geometry (Johnson Lindenstrauss for instance) 

The last aspect is how deep the phenomenon can go in terms of applications and ideas in adjacent fields, I'm thinking of mathematical physics with the principle of large deviations for instance etc.... 

Having said all that, what are things that you found to be really cool and impressive? 

Looking forward to reading your answers :) ",Dyww,1753710620.0,135,0.96,71,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1mbgpk9/what_is_a_general_principle_in_your_field_that/,/r/math/comments/1mbgpk9/what_is_a_general_principle_in_your_field_that/,math,True,False,False,False,False,,False

1maoejs,How Would You Start a Geometry Course?,"I’m planning for the upcoming school year and collaborating with a new colleague to teach Geometry.

In my own experience, I’ve found it more effective to start with basic constructions—not just to introduce key vocabulary and tools, but to build intuition and informal reasoning skills. From there, I typically move into transformations and then begin to formalize proofs through the lens of parallel lines and angle relationships.

I understand the push to get transformations in early, but I’m struggling with the logic of doing them *before* students even know how to bisect a segment or copy an angle.

Has anyone here used the Open Up Geometry materials as-is? Did the sequencing feel off to you, or did it work better than expected?

1mai0dt,Polar Legendre Transform ?,"Hi all, I'm a wildfire scientist researching algorithms that simulate the propagation of fire fronts. I'm not a specialist in the relevant mathematical domains, so I apologize in advance if I don't use the right jargon (that's the point of this post).

We tend to define models of fire propagation using polar coordinates, either through a Huygens wavelet W(θ) (in m/s) or using a front-normal spread rate F(θ) (also in m/s); the shape of these functions is dependent on inputs like fuels, weather and topography.

I've been studying the duality between both approaches, and I naturally arrive to the following dual relations, which look to me as if the Legendre and Fourier transform had had a baby:

\[Eq. 1\] F(θ) = max {W(θ+α)cos(α), α in *(-π/2, +π/2)*}

\[Eq. 2\] W(θ) = min {F(θ+α)/cos(α), α in *(-π/2, +π/2)*}

AFAICT, these equations are like the equivalent of a [Legendre Transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendre_transformation) (the one that's about convex conjugacy, not the integral transform), but for a slightly different notion of convexity - namely, the convexity of not the function's epigraph, but a ""radial"" notion of convexity, i.e. convexity of the set define in polar coordinates by {r <= W(θ)}. Eq 1 characterizes the supporting lines of that set; Eq 2 reconstructs (the ""radial convex envelope"" of) W from F. Some other things I've found:

1. F parameterizes the pedal curve of W;
2. It's interesting to rewrite \[Eq. 1\] as: 1/F(θ) = min {(1/W(θ + α)) / cos(α), α in *(-π/2, +π/2)*}
3. It's possible to express F from the Legendre transform f\* of a ""half-curve"" f, yielding a relation like F(θ) = cos(θ) f\*(tan θ)

***Is there a name to this Legendre-like transform? Is there literature I could study to get more familiar with this problem space?*** I sense that I'm scratching the surface of something deep, so it seems likely that this has been studied before; unfortunately the fire science literature tends to be appallingly uninterested in math.

# More formal details

Let me clarify the meaning of the F(θ) and W(θ) functions mentioned above.

One way to specify a model of fire spread is by using a *Huygens wavelet* W(θ). Here θ is an azimuth (an angle specifying a direction) and W(θ) is a velocity (in m/s). The idea is that if you start a fire by a point ignition at the origin and grow it for duration t, then the burned region will have a shape given by  (θ -> tW(θ)), i.e. it will be the region defined by (r <= tW(θ)) in polar coordinates.

Assuming some regularity conditions (mostly, that W is polar-convex), this is equivalent to a model where the fire perimeter at time t+dt is obtained by starting secondary ignitions everywhere in the time-t perimeter and taking the union of the infinitesimal secondary perimeters this generates; that's why we call this a *Huygens wavelet* model, by analogy with the propagation of light / wave fronts.

Another way to specify a model of fire spread is by using a *front-normal speed profile* F(θ) - still a function that maps an azimuth θ to a speed  in (m/s). F(θ) tells you how fast a linear fire front advances in the direction normal to itself, where that direction is indexed by θ.

Under some regularity conditions, a wavelet function W(θ) implies a front-normal spread rate F(θ), and conversely - this is what equations 1 and 2 above are telling us.",vvvvalvalval,1753608316.0,44,0.94,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1mai0dt/polar_legendre_transform/,/r/math/comments/1mai0dt/polar_legendre_transform/,math,True,False,False,False,False,,False

1m9zyog,What should I prioritize when doing self-directed study?,"Hey r/math, I hope this is within the purview of what's allowed on the subreddit and doesn't break any rules, but I think many of you could offer some clarity on what I should focus on with my math journey.

For some context, I currently work in finance in a ""research"" role that is supposed to be pretty math-heavy, or at least quantitatively focused. However, most of my time is focused on developing analysis tools and has been more of a data engineering role as of late. I bring this up to say that I miss doing more mathematical work, and want to spend more of my free time doing mathematics, and have even considered going back to school for PhD (I currently have a masters in applied math). I know I'm not the most talented at math, but I feel very passionate about it, and the prospect of having a job where I'm solely focused on teaching and researching math seems so enjoyable to me. 

I provide this context to say that I have a few different avenues of study that I could pursue, and I'm unsure what to prioritize or how to balance them. I'll list out the possible directions for self-study I was thinking of, and I'd love to hear which areas you think I should focus on.

1. **Mathematical Finance to excel at my job.** I don't have a finance background, and I've been learning a lot on the job on the fly. I feel that if I hunker down and read some literature related to my line of work, I could add more value to my current role and reduce the amount of software development work I have to do. A lot of that development work is unavoidable, but I find myself lacking confidence in presenting new ideas that I think would be useful to my boss. I think that if I devote time to studying here, I could develop more skills for the job and gain a passion for it that is lacking a bit, if I'm being honest. However, while my boss is analytically minded, he has no background in math, and I feel like there is a certain amount of futility in studying math for my job if my boss doesn't recognize the tools that I'm using, and if I have trouble explaining new models I want to use. The areas of study here would be the more traditional mathematical finance topics, time series modeling, brushing up on statistics, and optimization.

2. **Studying subjects that would be found on PhD qualifying exams.** Given that I hold a master's degree, I believe that studying to pass a qualifying exam is achievable, even if it would require a considerable amount of time and effort. I want to delve deeper into Analysis, Algebra, and other subjects. Additionally, being able to ""gamify"" my studying by taking qualifying exams and tracking my progress will help me improve my studying. I've tried self-directed studying before by simply opening a textbook and getting started, but I often lose steam pretty early on because I don't set a clear goal for myself. Even if I don't end up applying to a PhD program, I still feel that I'd gain a lot of personal value from studying core math subjects, as I am driven by my own curiosity. I have already learned some of these subjects at varying levels, but not to the level required to pass a qualifying exam, and I'm certainly rusty, given it's been a bit since I've sat down and tried to do a proof.

3. **Focusing on a problem and area of study I've done research in.** During my Master's program, I completed a thesis in the field of nonlinear dynamics. I enjoyed that thesis and the subject (shouts out to Strogatz's book and my professors for that), and if I were to go back to school, that would be the leading candidate of the field I want to study. Furthermore, during the process of finding readers for my thesis, I engaged in a lengthy email exchange with a professor (I never took one of his classes but I was recommended to reach out to him, given his background), during which he presented me with a problem that he thought I'd enjoy working on. It wasn't my thesis problem, but it was related in some ways. I'm not sure if it is a current research problem or an exciting toy problem, but either way, I've been thinking about the problem in the months since he presented it to me, and I think it would be fun to continue working on it. I have already found a solution to a specific version of the problem, but the goal is to work on a more generalized version of the problem. My only concern in dedicating a significant amount of time to this would be that it may not help me broaden my mathematical toolkit. Still, it was enjoyable working on a solution to it. Additionally, it would give me a reason to reach out to this professor again (it has been several months since I last contacted him), and I enjoyed exchanging emails with him at the time. (Sorry for being vague about what the problem is, as if this is an area of research that the professor was pursuing, I don't want to leak what his research is before he publishes anything.)

4. **Doing some competitive math problems for fun.** I never got into competition math, and I'm too old to participate in those competitions, but those problems always seemed pretty fun and could help me keep up with my studying. I never participated in math competitions, and I always regretted not trying. I already know this wouldn't be a priority compared to the others, but I'm curious if any of you spend time working on these problems for fun, and if they are good motivators for self-studying.

I would love to know what you think about how I should allocate my free time for studying, and whether you feel that any of these options are more worthwhile than others. 

Additionally, if anyone has any good books on nonlinear dynamics that go beyond Strogatz (and ideally have solutions to selected problems available), I'm all ears. I already have Perko's book and Wiggins' book.

1m9yalm,A deceptively tricky problem,"Hi! There's a problem I have tried for a while, and since I've run out of ideas/tools, I just wanted to post it here in case it picks someone's interest or triggers any interesting ideas/discussion. [Edit: plus, as I offered on my paper, linked at the end of the post, there’s a $100 bounty for a proof, in the spirit of idols of mine like Erd\Hos or Ronald Graham]

You have N rocks that you need to split into K piles (some potentially empty). Then a random process proceeds by rounds: 

\- in each round a non-empty pile is chosen uniformly at random (so with probability 1/|remaining piles|, without considering how large each pile is), and a rock is removed from that pile.

\- the process ends when a single non-empty pile remains.

  
The conjecture is that if you want to maximize the expected duration of the process, or equivalently, the expected size of the last remaining pile (since these two amounts always add up to N), you should divide the N rocks into roughly equal piles of size N/K (it's fine to assume that K divides N if needed). Let's take an intuitive look: consider N = 9, K = 3. One possible split is \[3,3,3\] and another one is \[6, 2, 1\]. 

An example of a  random history for the split \[3,3,3\] is:

\[3,3,3\] -> \[3,2,3\] -> \[2,2,3\] -> \[2,1,3\] -> \[2,1,2\] -> \[2, 0, 2\] -> \[2, 0, 1\] -> \[1, 0, 1\] -> \[0,0,1\]. This took 8 steps.

Whereas for \[6,2,1\] we might have:

\[6, 2, 1\] -> \[5,2,1\] -> \[5,2,0\] -> \[4,2,0\] -> \[4, 1, 0\] -> \[3,1,0\] -> \[3,0,0\], which took only 6 steps. 

  
It's easy to compute in this case with e.g., Python, that the expectation for \[3,3,3\] is 7.32... whereas for \[6,2,1\] it's 6.66... More in general, intuitively we expect that balanced configurations will survive longer. I have proved that this is the case for K=2 and K=3 ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03330](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03330)), but don't know how to prove this more in general. 

  
It might be worth mentioning that the problem is tightly related to random walks: the case K=2 can be described as that you do a random walk on the integer grid at a starting position (x, y) with x + y = N, and you move 1 unit down with prob 1/2 and 1 unit left with prob 1/2, and if you reach either axis then you are stuck there. The question here is to prove that the starting position that ends up the closest to (0,0) on expectation is to choose x = y = N/2.

1m9wdfv,I can only do math with other people. What do I do?,"Hi. I’m in a weird spot. I love math (or at least I think I do?), but I can’t seem to actually do it unless I’m with someone else. I’m not talking about needing help—I usually understand the concepts fine once I get going. It’s just that when I’m alone, I literally cannot start. I’ll open the textbook, stare at the first problem, and feel this intense boredom and inertia. Like my brain is fogged over.

But the second someone’s with me—studying together, walking through problems, just existing next to me—I can lock in. I’ve had some of my most focused and joyful math moments while explaining things to a friend or working silently next to someone at a library table.

This has become a serious problem. I want to do higher-level math, maybe even pursue it long-term, but I feel blocked. Not by difficulty, but by isolation. And I don’t know how to fix that. I can’t always rely on having a study buddy. I don’t want math to become something I can only access socially, because that feels fragile. But forcing myself to grind through alone just makes me hate it.

Has anyone dealt with this before? Is there a way to rewire this? Or is it just something I need to build systems around and accept?

Would love to hear if anyone’s been in this headspace.

1m9hb7v,Is there a name for this kind of problem,"Something I've been thinking on. Given a set of samples X\_i from R\^3 can I define a stochastic process X(t) such that:

1. X(0) = X\_a, X(1) = X\_b for some sample indices a,b (with probability 1)
2. X(t) is a continuous function of t (with probability 1)
3. X(t) distributed as p(x(t)) minimizes the expected value E\[L(X(t))\] for a given differentiable function L : R\^3 -> R

Essentially, given a set of samples can I define a Euler-Lagrange style path between 2 of the samples that minimizes the expected value of some function (serving the role of action). I assume the output of such an optimization procedure would be a pdf from which I could draw samples to get concrete values on my path.

I was thinking the loss function might be a kind of radial basis function to the samples so that the resulting path is as close as possible to the samples.

1m8vx31,"Losing the will to finish my PhD after my thesis was stolen, need advice","Hi all,

I'm 3 years into my 4-year PhD and I haven't published anything yet. I've just discovered that an academic from outside the institute visited my supervisor, and after a conversation about my research this visiting academic sneakily published some of the contents of my PhD thesis (his work is clearly written in a rush, and he said to my supervisor it was all new to him). My supervisor is furious with this academic, but he's said the best way forwards is just to move on and see what we can put into my thesis in the remaining time.

I don't actually want to continue within academia. Between this and the royal shit-storm of my life outside of my PhD I just feel completely exhausted -- my parents were made homeless while my dad was battling cancer, and I was the only family member able to support my sister after she was in hospital because of an attempt on her own life. My institute has done nothing to support me, and won't let me take time off, and I have 8 months to finish my thesis which would now involve starting a new project. I can do this in the time left, maybe,  but I just don't think I can actually find the motivation to carry on anymore. I've just worked so hard and I'm so close to the end I feel like I'm at the last hurdle and someone's pushed me down.

I know it's so ""woe is me"", but after all I've been through during my PhD  it just feels so unfair that this academic has stolen my work. I'm at a complete loss. What do I do?

  
**Edit**: Huge response, I've been reading and processing a lot. I guess a few comments are in order.



Firstly, given the similarity of the work, the timing, the rushed quality of their work, and the lack of acknowledgements to me or my supervisor, I think it's highly likely it's plagiarized, not an independent discovery. Secondly, I should clarify that my supervisor doesn't think I should just ignore it, but he knows how I'm feeling about academia, and said it's not worth my energy to try and prove plagiarism has occurred -- his advice is to just go on ahead, get my PhD and mention the similar work (and maybe make a petty comment about the clearly stolen work).

1m88gn7,AI and mathematics: some thoughts,"Following the IMO results, as a postdoc in math, I had some thoughts. How reasonable do you think they are? If you're a mathematican are you thinking of switching industry?

*1. Computers will eventually get pretty good at research math, but will not attain supremacy*

If you ask commercial AIs math questions these days, they will often get it right or almost right. This varies a lot by research area; my field is quite small (no training data) and full of people who don't write full arguments so it does terribly. But in some slightly larger adjacent fields it does much better - it's still not great at computations or counterexamples, but can certainly give correct proofs of small lemmas.

There is essentially no field of mathematics with the same amount of literature as the olympiad world, so I wouldn't expect the performance of a LLM there to be representative of all of mathematics due to lack of training data and a huge amount of results being folklore.

*2. Mathematicians are probably mostly safe from job loss.*

Since Kasparov was beaten by Deep Blue, the number of professional chess players internationally has increased significantly. With luck, AIs will help students identify weaknesses and gaps in their mathematical knowledge, increasing mathematical knowledge overall. It helps that mathematicians generally depend on lecturing to pay the bills rather than research grants, so even if AI gets amazing at maths, students will still need teacher.s

*3. The prestige of mathematics will decrease*

Mathematics currently (and undeservedly, imo) enjoys much more prestige than most other academic subjects, except maybe physics and computer science. Chess and Go lost a lot of its prestige after computers attained supremecy. The same will eventually happen to mathematics.

*4. Mathematics will come to be seen more as an art*

In practice, this is already the case. Why do we care about arithmetic Langlands so much? How do we decide what gets published in top journals? The field is already very subjective; it's an art guided by some notion of rigor. An AI is not capable of producing a beautiful proof yet.

But then there are some things that use such fundamentally different ways of thinking, and techniques that i have never dreamt of, and that stresses me a lot. I am not new to the proof-writing business at all; i've been doing this for a couple of years now. But i still feel really really bad after attacking a problem in various ways over the course of a couple of days and several hours, and see that the author has such a simple yet strikingly beautiful way of doing it, that it fills me with a primal insecurity of whether there is really something missing in me that throws me out of the league.

I'll just give the most fresh incident that led me to make this post. I am learning linear algebra from Axler's book, and am at the section 2B, where he talks about span and linear independence. There is this theorem that says that the size of any linearly independent set of vectors is always smaller than the size of any spanning set of vectors. I am trying this since yesterday, and have spent at least 5 hours on this one theorem, trying to prove it. Given any spanning and any independent set, i tried to find a surjection from the former to the latter. In the end, i just gave up and looked at the proof. It makes such an elegant use of the linear dependence lemma discussed right before it, that i feel internally broken. I couldn't bring myself even close to the level of understanding or maturity or whatever it takes to be able to come up with such a thing, although when i covered that lemma, i was able to prove it and thought i understood it well enough.

1m8016o,3x3 magic square of squares - Full House Pattern.,"We have found several novel patterns in our research of semi-magic squares of squares where the diagonal totals match (examples in Image). We think this may also open up a different approach to proving that a perfect magic square of squares is impossible, although to date we've not proven it.

For example, grid A has 6 matching totals of 26,937, including both diagonals; and the other 2 totals also match each other. This example has the lowest values of this pattern that we think exists. Grid B has the highest values we found up to the searched total of just over 17 million with a non-square total.

We've been calling these a Full House pattern, taking a poker reference. Up to the total, we found 170 examples of the Full House pattern with a non-square total.

Grid C and grid D also have full house pattern, with one of the totals also square. These are the lowest and highest values we found up to the total of 300million. Interestingly, only one of the two Full House totals is square in any example we found, and excluding multiples there are only three distinct examples up to a total of 300million. All the others we found were multiples of these same three.

Using these examples, we developed a simple formula (grid F) that always generates the Full House pattern using arithmetic progressions, although not always with square numbers. The centre value can also be switched to a + u + v1, giving different totals in the same pattern. We are currently trying to find an equivalent to the Lucas Formula for these, trying to replicate the approach taken by King and Morgenstern amongst other ideas from the extensive work on [http://www.multimagie.com/](http://www.multimagie.com/)

These Full House examples also have the property that three times the centre value minus one total is the difference between the two totals, analogous to magic squares always having a total that is three times the centre.

Along the way, we've used Unity, C#, ChatGPT, and Grok to explore this problem starting from sub-optimal brute search all the way to an optimised search using the GPU. The more optimised search looks for target totals that give square numbers when divide by 3 and assumes this is the centre number (using the property of all magic squares), and then generates pairwise combinations of squares that sum to the remainder needed for the rows and columns to match this total. 

With this, we also went on journey of discovering there are no perfect square of squares all the way up to a total of just over 1.6 x 10^(16.) 

We also created a small game that allows people explore finding magic squares of squares interactively here [https://zyphullen.itch.io/mqoqs](https://zyphullen.itch.io/mqoqs)",Zyphullen,1753350244.0,10,0.92,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1m8016o/3x3_magic_square_of_squares_full_house_pattern/,/r/math/comments/1m8016o/3x3_magic_square_of_squares_full_house_pattern/,math,True,False,False,False,False,,False

1m7yub5,What does math look like in your eyes?,"Hello, I’m a prospective university student in China. 
I got 135/150 scores in the math exam in Chinese Gaokao, the university entrance exam, which is  almost the most important examination for Chinese students. Actually I’m satisfied with my score, but it’s not a good score for those who are really good at math.
I used to be crazy about math, but now I lost my interests.
When I was in junior high school, I enjoyed the joy of exploring new knowledge. However I was a loser in Zhongkao, the senior high school entrance exam. But I still loved math, so I learnt the high school math knowledge in advance. As you can see, I did do a great job in high school. 
That’s not the end. I participated in the AMC for 3 times. I succeeded in the last time, I got 99 scores in AMC and 8 scores in AIME and even got HMMT invitation but I refused. It’s a pity that I generally lost interests in math in grade 12. This year, I had to spend all my time preparing Gaokao, but I found that in China math was the only thing—calculation. The problems were designed to be extremely difficult, so I began to doubt my talent. I thought that if I couldn’t solve these problems, I must be an idiocy. 
I read Mathematics For Human Flourishing written by Francis Su, who is the only ethnic Chinese who served as the president of the American Mathematical Society. I totally agree with him and I know I used to enjoy the 12 parts written by him.
And now I decided that I won’t major in math in university, but I still wonder what does math look like in your eyes.
I would appreciate it if you could share with me.

1m7as9j,Question in proof of least upper bound property,"From baby rudin chapter 1 Appendix : construction of real numbers or you can see other proofs of L.U.B of real numbers.

From proof of least upper bound property of real numbers.

If we let any none empty set of real number = A as per book. 
Then take union of *alpha* = M ; where *alpha*(real number) is cuts contained in A.
I understand proof that M is also real number.
But how it can have least upper bound property?
For example A = {-1,1,√2} 
Then M = √2 (real number) = {x | x^2 < 2 & x < 0 ; x belongs to Q}.

1)We performed union so it means M is real number and as per i mentioned above √2 has not least upper bound.

2) Another interpretation is that real numbers is ordered set so set A has relationship -1 is proper subset of 1 and -1,1 is proper subset of √2 so we can define relationship between them -1<1<√2 then by definition of least upper bound or supremum 
sup(A) = √2.

Second interpretation is making sense but here union operation is performed so how 1st interpretation has least upper bound?",engineer3245,1753280989.0,6,0.75,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1m7as9j/question_in_proof_of_least_upper_bound_property/,/r/math/comments/1m7as9j/question_in_proof_of_least_upper_bound_property/,math,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1m7834u,Is hyperexponential number of subobjects possible?,"Consider families of structures that have a well-defined finite ""number of points"" and a well-defined finite number of substructures, like sets, graphs, polytopes, algebraic structures, topological spaces, etc., and ""simple"" ¹ restrictions of those families like simplices, n-cubes, trees, segments of ℕ containing a given point, among others. 

Now, for such a family, look at the function S(n) := ""among structures A with n points, the supremum of the count of substructures of A"", and moreso we're interested just in its asymptotics. Examples:

- for sets and simplices, S(n) = Θ(2^n)
- for cubes, S(n) = n^(log₂ 3) ≈ n^1.6 — polynomial
- for segments of ℕ containing 0, S(n) = n — linear!

So there are all different possible asymptotics for S. My main question is if it's possible to have it be hyperexponential. I guess if our structures constitute a topos, the answer is no because, well, ""exponentiation is exponentiation"" and subobjects of A correspond to characteristic functions living in Ω^A which can't(?) grow faster than exponential, for a suitable way of defining cardinality (I don't know how it's done in that case because I expect it to be useless for many topoi?..)

But we aren't constrained to pick just from topoi, and in this general case I have zero intuition if maybe it's somehow possible. I tried my intuition of ""sets are the most structure-less things among these, so maybe delete more"" but pre-sets (sets without element equality) lack the neccessary scaffolding (equality) to define subobjects and cardinality. I tried to invent pre-sets with a bunch of incompatible equivalence relations but that doesn't give rise to anything new.

I had a vague intuition that looking at *distributions* might work but I forget how exactly that should be done at all, probably a thinko from the start. Didn't pursue that.

So, I wonder if somebody else has this (dis)covered (if hyperexponential growth is possible and then how exactly it is or isn't). And additionally about what neat examples of structures with interesting asymptotics there are, like something between polynomial and exponential growth, or sub-linear, or maybe an interesting characterization of a family of structures with S(n) = O(1). My attempt was ""an empty set"" but it doesn't even work because there aren't empty sets of every size n, just of n = 0. Something non-cheaty and natural if it's at all possible.

1m72n1m,Knots made from a loop of 6 unit line segments?,"I've recently been wondering about what knots you can make with a loop of n disjoint (excluding vertices) line segments. I managed to sketch a proof that with n=5, all such loops are equivalent to the unknot: There is always a projection onto 2d space that leaves finitely many intersections that don't lie on the vertices, and with casework on knot diagrams the only possibilities remaining not equivalent to the unknot are the following up to symmetries including reflection and swapping over/under:

A contradiction appears then, as the circled triangle must have an increase in height after going counterclockwise around the points.

  
It's easy to see that a trefoil can be made with 6 line segments as follows:

However, in trying to find a way to make such a knot with unit vectors, this particularly symmetrical method didn't work. I checked dozens of randomized loops to see if I missed something obvious, but I couldn't find anything. Here's the Desmos graph I used for this: [https://www.desmos.com/3d/n9en6krgd3](https://www.desmos.com/3d/n9en6krgd3) (in the saved knots folder are examples of the trefoil and figure eight knot with 7 unit vectors).

1m6sooc,A brief perspective from an IMO coordinator,"I was one of the coordinators at the IMO this year, meaning I was responsible for assigning marks to student scripts and coordinating our scores with leaders. Overall, this was a tiring but fun process, and I could expand on the joys (and horrors) if people were interested.

I just wanted to share a few thoughts in light of recent announcements from AI companies:

1. We were asked, mid-IMO, to additionally coordinate AI-generated scripts and to have completed marking by the end of the IMO. My sense is that the 90 of us collectively refused to formally do this. It obviously distracts from the priority of coordination of actual student scripts; moreover, many believed that an expedited focus on AI results would overshadow recognition of student achievement.

2. I would be somewhat skeptical about any claims suggesting that results have been verified in some form by coordinators. At the closing party, AI company representatives were, disappointingly, walking around with laptops and asking coordinators to evaluate these scripts on-the-spot (presumably so that results could be published quickly). This isn't akin to the actual coordination process, in which marks are determined through consultation with (a) confidential marking schemes*, (b) input from leaders, and importantly (c) discussion and input from other coordinators and problem captains, for the purposes of maintaining consistency in our marks.

3. Echoing the penultimate paragraph of https://petermc.net/blog/, there were no formal agreements or regulations or parameters governing AI participation. With no details about the actual nature of potential ""official IMO certification"", there were several concerns about scientific validity and transparency (e.g. contestants who score zero on a problem still have their mark published).

\* a separate minor point: these take many hours to produce and finalize, and comprise the collective work of many individuals. I do not think commercial usage thereof is appropriate without financial contribution.

Personally, I feel that if the aim of the IMO is to encourage and uplift an upcoming generation of young mathematicians, then facilitating student participation and celebrating their feats should undoubtedly be the primary priority for all involved.",Numericality,1753224501.0,717,0.98,94,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1m6sooc/a_brief_perspective_from_an_imo_coordinator/,/r/math/comments/1m6sooc/a_brief_perspective_from_an_imo_coordinator/,math,True,False,False,False,False,,False

Isn't it true that I(X) has to be radical anyway and that radical ideals are the finite intersection of prime ideals (in a Noetherian ring, anyway)? Wouldn't that get you directly to your union of affine varieties?  

I was under the impression that Lasker-Noether was a generalization of the ""prime decomposition"" for radical ideals to a more general form of decomposition for ideals in general, but at least as far as algebraic sets are concerned, it doesn't seem necessary to invoke it.

1m5wipb,Why reality has a well-known math bias,"Hi all,

I've written up a post tackling the ""unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics."" My core argument is that we can potentially resolve Wigner's puzzle by applying an anthropic filter, but one focused on the evolvability of mathematical minds rather than just life or consciousness.

The thesis is that for a mind to evolve from basic pattern recognition to abstract reasoning, it needs to exist in a universe where patterns are layered, consistent, and compounding. In other words, a ""mathematically simple"" universe. In chaotic or non-mathematical universes, the evolutionary gradient towards higher intelligence would be flat or negative.

Therefore, any being capable of asking ""why is math so effective?"" would most likely find itself in a universe where it is.

I try to differentiate this from past evolutionary/anthropic arguments and address objections (Boltzmann brains, simulation, etc.). I'm particularly interested in critiques of the core ""evolutionary gradient"" claim and the ""distribution of universes"" problem I bring up near the end.

The argument spans a number of academic disciplines, however I think it most centrally falls under ""philosophy of science."" Nonetheless, math is obviously very important to this core question, and I see that there has been at least 10+ prior discussions about Wigner's puzzle in this sub! So I'm especially excited to hear arguments and responses. This is my first post in this sub, so apologies if I made a mistake with local norms. I'm happy to clear up any conceptual confusions or non-standard uses of jargon in the comments.

Looking forward to the discussion.

1m5vow8,"Is it common to ""rediscover"" known theorems while playing with math?","When I'm studying math and come across a new concept or theorem, I often like to experiment with it tweak things, ask “what if,” and see what patterns or results emerge. Sometimes, through this process, I end up forming what feels like a new conjecture or even a whole new theorem. I get excited, do many examples by hand and after they all seem to work out, I run simulations or code to test it on lots of examples and attempt to prove ""my"" result… only to later find out that what I “discovered” was already known maybe 200 years ago!

This keeps happening, and while it's a bit humbling(and sometime times discouraging that I wasted hours only to discover ""my"" theorem is already well known), it also makes me wonder: is this something a lot of people go through when they study math?",OkGreen7335,1753133514.0,402,0.96,95,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1m5vow8/is_it_common_to_rediscover_known_theorems_while/,/r/math/comments/1m5vow8/is_it_common_to_rediscover_known_theorems_while/,math,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1m5v3xs,"The Collatz Conjecture & Algebraic Geometry (a.k.a., I have a new paper out!)","Though it's still undergoing peer review (with an acceptance hopefully in the near future), I wanted to share my latest [research project](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.13358) with the community, as I believe this work will prove to be significant at some point in the (again, hopefully near) future.

My purpose in writing it was to establish a rigorous foundation for many of the key technical procedures I was using. The end result is what I hope will prove to be the basis of a robust new formalism.

Let p be an integer ≥ 2, and let R be a certain commutative, unital algebra generated by indeterminates r*_j_* and c*_j_* for j in {0, ... , p - 1}—say, generated by these indeterminates over a global field K. The boilerplate example of an F-series is a function X: ℤ*_p_* —> R, where ℤ*_p_* is the ring of p-adic integers, satisfying functional equations of the shape:

X(pz + j) = r*_j_*X(z) + c*_j_*

for all z in Z*_p_*, and all j in {0, ..., p - 1}.

In my paper, I show that you can do Fourier analysis with these guys in a very general way. X admits a Fourier series representation and may be realized as an R-valued distribution (and possibly even an R-valued measure) on ℤ*_p_*. The algebro-geometric aspect of this is that my construction is functorial: given any ideal I of R, provided that I does not contain the ideal generated by 1 - r*_0_*, you can consider the map ℤ*_p_* —> R/I induced by X, and all of the Fourier analytic structure described above gets passed to the induced map.

Remarkably, the Fourier analytic structure extends not just to pointwise products of X against itself, but also to pointwise products of any finite collection of F-series ℤ*_p_* —> R. These products also have Fourier transforms which give convergent Fourier series representations, and can be realized as distributions, in stark contrast to the classical picture where, in general, the pointwise product of two distributions does not exist. In this way, we can use F-series to build finitely-generated algebra of distributions under pointwise multiplication. Moreover, all of this structure is compatible with quotients of the ring R, provided we avoid certain ""bad"" ideals, in the manner of <1 - r*_0_*> described above.

The punchline in all this is that, apparently, these distributions and the algebras they form and their Fourier theoretic are sensitive to points on algebraic varieties. 

Let me explain. 

Unlike in classical Fourier analysis, the Fourier transform of X is, in general, not guaranteed to be unique! Rather, it is only unique when you quotient out the vector space X belongs to by a vector space of novel kind of singular non-archimedean measures I call **degenerate measures**. This means that X's Fourier transform belongs to an affine vector space (a coset of the space of degenerate measures). For each n ≥ 1, to the pointwise product X^n, there is an associated affine algebraic variety I call the **nth breakdown variety** of X. This is the locus of r*_j_*s in K so that:

r*_0_*^n + ... + r*_p-1_*^n = p

Due to the recursive nature of the constructions involved, given n ≥ 2, if we specialize by quotienting R by an ideal which evaluates the r*_j_*s at a choice of scalars in K, it turns out that the number of degrees of freedom (linear dimension) you have in making a choice of a Fourier transform for X^n is equal to the number of integers k in {1, ... ,n} for which the specified values of the r*_j_*s lie in X's kth breakdown variety. 

So far, I've only scratched the surface of what you can do with F-series, but I strongly suspect that this is just the tip of the iceberg, and that there is more robust dictionary between algebraic varieties and distributions just waiting to be discovered.

I also must point out that, just in the past week or so, I've stumbled upon a whole circle of researchers engaging in work within an epsilon of my own, thanks to my stumbling upon the work of [Tuomas Sahlsten](https://www.mv.helsinki.fi/home/sahlsten/) and others, following in the wake of an important result of [Dyatlov and Bourgain's](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.02909). I've only just begun to acquaint myself with this body of research—it's definitely going to be many, many months until I am up to speed on this stuff—but, so far, I can say with confidence that my research can be best understood as a kind of p-adic backdoor to the study of self-similar measures associated to the fractal attractors of iterated function systems (IFSs). 

For those of you who know about this sort of thing, my big idea was to replace the space of words (such as those used in Dyatlov and Bourgain's paper) with the set of p-adic integers. This gives the space of words the structure of a compact abelian group. Given an IFS, I can construct an F-series X for it; this is a function out of ℤ*_p_* (for an appropriately chosen value of p) that parameterizes the IFS' fractal attractor in terms of a p-adic variable, in a manner formally identical to the well-known [de Rham curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Rham_curve) construction. In this case, when all the maps in the IFS are attracting, X^n has a unique Fourier transform for all n ≥ 0, and the exponential generating function:

phi(t) = 1 + (∫X)(-2πit) + (∫X^(2)) (-2πit)^2 / 2! + ...

is precisely the Fourier transform of the self-similar probability measure associated to the IFS' fractal attractor that everyone in the past few years has been working so diligently to establish decay estimates for. My work generalizes this to ring-valued functions! A long-term research goal of my approach is to figure out a way to treat X as a geometric object (that is, a curve), toward the end of being able to define and compute this curve's algebraic invariants, by which it may be possible to make meaningful conclusions about the dynamics of Collatz-type maps.

My biggest regret here is that I didn't discover the IFS connection until *after* I wrote my paper!",Aurhim,1753132148.0,87,0.66,117,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1m5v3xs/the_collatz_conjecture_algebraic_geometry_aka_i/,/r/math/comments/1m5v3xs/the_collatz_conjecture_algebraic_geometry_aka_i/,math,True,False,False,False,False,,False

1m5s4g4,polynomials with “linear” chains of critical points and values,"Let P(z) = a_1z + … + a_dz^d , a_1, a_d nonzero, be a degree d>=2 polynomial fixing zero. Suppose P has critical values 0<t_1 <= … < = t_{d-1}=1 (counting multiplicity), and 1 is a critical point of P such that P(1)=1. Here t_j are the critical values , j=1,…d-1 (0 is not one).

Further suppose that there exists a Jordan arc from 0 to 1 consisting of several finite critical arcs of orthogonal trajectories of the associated quadratic differential 
(-1)(P’(z)/P(z))^2 dz^2, along which |P| is strictly increasing which contains a full set of critical points of P. This means the arc could be an orthogonal trajectory from 0 to some critical point corresponding to t_1, then from that critical point to some critical point corresponding to t_2, and so on, until t_{d-1}=1 is reached, all the while each critical subarc between consecutive critical points in the total concatenation of such arcs is traversed in the direction of increasing |P|, and we encounter a sequence of critical points b_k along the total arc each corresponding to t_j, j=1,…,d-1. In other words, the critical points we encounter correspond to every critical value (without multiplicity). This does not mean we have to encounter d-1 critical points overall, we only encounter as many critical points as there are critical values, so there could be say m critical points encountered overall if the number of critical values is *without* counting multiplicities.

Moreover suppose we know that for each encountered critical point b_k, |b_k|< P(b_k) holds.

Under these assumptions, is there anything we can say about the critical points of P? It seems too strong to say this should mean P’s critical points lie on a ray [0,1], but given this topological description, P should bear a lot of resemblance to such a polynomial. 

Any ideas on how to make this more precise?

1m58awa,"On a ""2/3"" study strategy","I guess I'm mostly writing this so I don't forget in the future.
---

This semester I had a realization on the fact that it'd probably be better for me to start reading textbooks from about 2/3 into the material:

1. I was struggling through measure theory, then on page 123/184 of the lecture notes I saw the result

    If f is absolutely continous on [a,b], then f' exists almost everywhere, is integrable, and \int_a\^b f'(x) dx = f(b) - f(a)

    and suddenly all of the course stopped being an annoying sequence of unnecessarily technical results but something that is needed to make the above result work.

2. I felt like I had to understand some basic category theory, so I was reading through Riehl's Category Theory in Context.

  Again it all felt like a lot of unnecessarily technical stuff until on page 158/258 I saw 

  Stone-Čech compactification defines a reflector for the subcategory cHaus \to Top

  and I felt motivated to understand how is that related to the Stone-Čech compactification I've learned about in topology.

---

In _Linear Algebra Done Right_ Axler talks about (I'm paraphrasing from memory here) a concept being ""useful"" if it helps to prove a result without making a reference to that concept. The example was the statement

    In L(R^n) there do not exist linear operators S,T such that I = ST - TS, where I is the identity

Solution: >!Take trace on both sides, then n = 0 leads to a contradiction!<

So I'm thinking that, for me, it's easier to understand a theory whenever I have found a somewhat ""useful"" concept

In the meantime I discovered Vampire and by reading their technical report I started the implementation of automatic theorem proving features.



Now, the main feature that is still missing is the one of tactics, the part of the language that users use to ""code"" their proof. Since this is one of the main source of friction for proof formalization, before simply copying what lean or coq have done, I figured I'd ask you what you want from a proof assistant. What feature do you like and what feature do you wish were implemented? Have you worked with coq/lean/hol/isabelle/matita before and if so what did you not like about them? What about vampire, is that missing something?

1m3yy19,Intuition for the degree of an extension of local fields,"If K/Q is a number field with ring of integers O_K, p is a rational prime, and P is a prime of K above p, then we can form the completion of K at P, denoted K_P. This is an extension of the p-adics Q_p. In particular, the degree of this extension of local fields is the product ef, where e is the ramification degree of P over p, and f is the residue class degree (or inertia degree).

What’s your intuition for this being the degree of this local field extension?

One consequence is that K_P and Q_p are isomorphic if and only if P is unramified and has inertia degree 1 above p. I don’t really see why this should be the case, like what obstructions would prevent K_P and Q_p being equal if there were ramification, or if p stays inert?",Additional_Formal395,1752938792.0,32,0.97,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1m3yy19/intuition_for_the_degree_of_an_extension_of_local/,/r/math/comments/1m3yy19/intuition_for_the_degree_of_an_extension_of_local/,math,True,False,False,False,False,,False

While writing about the connection between spectral properties of A^TA and AA^T ([link](https://www.linearalgebraforprogrammers.com/blog/matrix_transpose_product) for those interested), I found out another explanation of why the right ellipse (corresponding to A^T) is invariant under the rotation of A. 

If A = UDV^T, rotating A is the same as rotating U, since RA = (RU)DV^T. Here is the key insight: the matrix A maps the columns of V to columns of U scaled by the singular values. Similarly A^T maps the columns of U to columns of V scaled similarly. Now when U is rotated,

- the input for the mapping from V to UD (by A) is fixed while the output is rotated. This is why the left ellipse rotates.
- the output for the mapping from U to VD (by A^T) is fixed while the input is rotated. This can be seen as a change of basis to represent the points on a circle. But the output (set of Ax for x on a unit circle) remains unchanged. Hence the right ellipse does not rotate.

1m3mk4q,Sharing my (unfinished) open source book on differential geometry,"My background is in mathematical physics and theoretical physics but I've been taken with geometry for quite a while and ended up writing notes that eventually grew into a book. I could drone on forever about all the ways I think it's a useful text, but most of that would be subjective, so I'll just refer to the preface for that. Mainly I'll point out that it's deliberately open source, intentionally wide in scope (but not aimless) and as close to comprehensive as I find pedagogically reasonable, and to a large extent doesn't require much peer review because a lot of it is more or less directly borrowed from existing literature (with citations). In fact, some of the chapters are basically abridged versions of entire books that I rewrote in matching notation and incorporated into a unified narrative. This is another major reason to keep this an open source project, since it's obviously not publishable, and honestly I think it's more useful this way anyway.

My particular obsession over the course of writing the book became *Cartan geometry*. I came to think of it as the cornerstone of all ""classical"" differential geometry in that it leads to a fairly precise definition of what classical differential geometry *is* (classification of geometric structures up to equivalence, see Chapter 17), and beautifully unifies many common subjects in geometry. Cartan geometry has many sides to it — theory of differential equations/systems, Cartan connections, and equivalence problems/methods. There wasn't any single source that satisfactorily included all of these sides of Cartan geometry and explained the connections between them, so I created one by merging material from the best books on these topics and filling in the gaps myself. 

In terms of prerequisites, this is *not* an introductory text. The first two chapters on point set topology and basic properties of manifolds are basically just a quick reference. I might rewrite them later, but as it stands, this book will not quite replace, say, Lee's ""Smooth Manifolds"". On the other hand, introductory differential geometry is very well covered by existing books like Lee, so I saw no need to recreate them. So, with that warning, I can recommend the book to anyone who wants to learn some differential geometry beyond the basics. This includes geometric theory of Lie groups, fiber bundles, group actions, geometric structures (including G-structures, a fundamental concept throughout the book), and connections. Along the way, homotopy theory and (co)homology arise as natural topics to cover, and both are covered in quite more detail than any popular geometry text I've seen.

So I hope folks will find this useful. The book still has many unfinished or even unstarted chapters, so it's probably only about halfway done. Nevertheless, the finished parts already tell a pretty coherent story, which is why I'm posting it now.

I barely created something new, and I know it's really hard for an undergrad to do so in a short time period.

We have just agreed to start on a specific topic in survival analysis (Length-biased, Right-censored sampling) and I am sort of lost.

1m3ena2,What is number theory?,"I have come to the painful realization that I do not know what number theory is.

My first instinct would be ""anything related to divisibility/to primes"". However, all of commutative algebra and algebraic geometry have been subsumed by the concept, under the form of ideals and the prime spectrum, generalizing things which were maybe originally developed for studying prime numbers to basically any ring, any scheme, any stack, etc.
Even things like completions/valuations, Henselian rings, Hensel's lemma, ramification filtration, etc, which certainly have their roots in the study of number fields, Ostrowski's theorem, local-global phenomena, are now part of larger ""analytic geometry"", be it rigid, Berkovich, etc.

A second instinct would be ""anything related to the integers"". First, I think as the initial object of the category of rings the integers are unavoidable in anything that uses algebra (a scheme is by default a scheme over Z!). But even then number theory focuses a lot on things which are not integers, be it number fields and their rings of integers in general, purely local fields (p-adic or function fields), and also function fields which are very different from number fields, and which I feel like should really be part of algebraic geometry.

One could say ""OK, but algebraic geometry over finite fields has arithmetic flavour because of how the base field is not algebraically closed"". Would anyone call real algebraic geometry arithmetic geometry? I feel like in both cases the Galois group being (topologically) monogenic means that the ""arithmetic""/descent datum is really not that complex.

What's an example of something unambiguously number-theoretic? Class field theory? It seems that the ""geometric class field theory"" in the sense of Katz and Lang shows that it is largely a related to phenomena about geometry of varieties over finite fields and their abelianized étale fundamental groups, so it can be thought as being part of algebraic geometry, at least for the ""function fields"" half of it.

Just a dumb curiosity of the top of my head: combinatory logic is usually seen as unpractical to calculate/do proofs in. I would think the prefix notation that emerges when applying combinators to arguments would have something to do with that. From my memory I can only remember the K (constant) and W combinators being actually binary/2-adic (taking just two arguments as input) so a infix notation could work better, but I could imagine many many more.

My question is: could a calculus equivalent to SKI/SK/BCKW or useful for anything at all be formalized just with binary/2-adic combinators? Has someone already done that? (I couldn't find anything after about an hour of research) I could imagine myself trying to represent these other ternary and n-ary combinators with just binary ones I create (and I am actually trying to do that right now) but I don't have the skills to actually do it smartly or prove it may be possible or not.

I could imagine myself going through Curry's Combinatory Logic 1 and 2 to actually learn how to do that but I tried it once and I started to question whether it would be worth my time considering I am not actually planning to do research on combinatory logic, especially if someone has already done that (as I may imagine it is the case).

For the purpose of this, I'm thinking of the function f(x)=floor(x). This function should have at least those 2 generalized asymptotes as far as I'm concerned: g1(x)=x and g2(x)=x-1. It should also specifically not have h(x)=1, 2, 3, etc... as asymptotes.

I was thinking of defining this generalized asymptotes as:

>g(x) is a generalized asymptote for f(x) if for any epsilon > 0, there exists an M such that for any DeltaM, the cardinality of the points in {x > M+DeltaM such that |f(x)-g(x)| < epsilon} is infinite

It's a bit of an hand-wavy definition (I'm not great with this kind of stuff), but the idea is the usual definition for a limit to infinity BUT with an added DeltaM to avoid counting infinitely many points in a finite interval (so in the example of the floor function, if you choose g(x)=3, choosing a value of M = 3 would give you infinite points in the interval \[3,4), but since it also needs to work for any DeltaM this is impossible as DeltaM=1 already makes it so that no point makes it into the set).

I'm sure this already exists, but I couldn't find it defined anywhere. Does anyone know how it's called and/or defined?

1m2rlgc,Some advice from a graduate,"Just recently graduated with a First Class in a BEng for Aerospace Engineering. My A-levels for Physics and Mathematics were both A\*s. I have some advice that has worked well for me, and I want to share it with you students.

1) Do not stop at the easy problems. Such worksheets are made to grant you a false sense of self-confidence, which is unearned. It is self-harm. You are not only cheating yourself but, also, depriving yourself of a real sense of mastery. Is it not so, that we will encounter such an exam question that makes your brain tremble in that exam hall? Why? Didn't we do those Mathsgenie questions, did we not master said topic? No! We fooled ourselfs, and for what, nothing.

The step to mastery is to struggle, acknowledge the topics you struggle with and stare across the chasm of mathematical-terror unflinchingly. Others have mastered it, why not you, after all, they too are human, only that they put in their hours of struggle. Having understood the foundational concepts of a topic, instead of going to Mathsgenie or another silly site for questions, I enjoin upon you all to use Madasmaths. It is an excellent website with many terribly difficult topic questions (I recommend doing the IYGB papers, all of them!). Become accustomed to struggling and the not knowing. It tastes sweet. When you are doing a question about Trigonemtric Integrals, and you have no clue where to start, revel in this, taste its sweetness; it is born from an excitement of imminent mastery.

When you struggle, your neurons are struggling to find a connection, and with enough forced and genuine struggle, new pathways are created to bridge those gaps. This, my friends, is learning, and enough of that results in mastery. Of course, you want to try to be correct also, but, I think, the benefits are reaped during the struggle, not the correctness of a solution.

2) This advice pertains specifically to Exams. When taking a Mathematics (or another science I suppose) exam, you will sometimes come across a question you do not know and after spending 8 or 10 minutes on it, you will move on, feeling defeated. This will happen maybe once or twice again in that exam paper, and those questions will remain unsolved. Ah, you have been defeated! Don't worry however, I have a little trick. Do note however, this trick only works particularly well for those who listen to advice (1) and struggle.

When you see a question, and after 2/3 minutes of staring and doodling information that is already stated, you are still not anywhere closer to the solution- circle it, and move on. What will happen is this: You will solve the answers for subsequent questions. You will grow a level of self-confidence within your subconscience, and that same subconscious will be working out possible solutions for the question you circled. By the time you get back to that circled unanswered problem, you will feel enlightened, it is very possible a solution will pop up in your head and a feeling of immense satisfaction will follow. The benefits of only spending 2/3 minutes on a question rather than 10 is that you do not want to exhaust your subconscious, you want to give it space to work. This may all sound silly, but trust me, it works.

1m2718e,Sum of remainders mod n,"Let's denote rem(x) remainder after dividing x by n. Fix 1<c1,c2<n. I want to show that if for every 0<r<n we have rem(c1\*r)+rem((n+1-c1)\*r) = rem(c2\*r)+rem((n+1-c2)\*r), then it's necessary either c1=c2 or c1+c2=n+1? These conditions are clearly sufficient, but I was unable to show the converse.

The equation rem(c1\*r)+rem((n+1-c1)\*r) always equals to either r or r+n, depending on ""overflows"" it or not. And the pattern is determined solely by c (for fixed n).

I've tried to rewrite it using fractional part {x}, since we have rem(x) = n\*{x/n} for x in Z. This constructions leads to interesting implications if we rewrite the fractional part as a Fourier series. Namely, we get a funky series in which k-th term looks like

1/k \* sin (pi \* k \* r / n) sin (pi \* k \* r (c1-c2) / n) sin (pi \* k \* r (c1+c2-1) / n)

and the series itself converges to 0. If only it was possible to show, that at least one of factors must be constantly 0, then we'd get the original statement. Any ideas?

  
Edit:

I've made a simple playground, if some wants to see it numerically. For f(r,c) I denote scaled and shifted version of rem(c1\*r)+rem((n+1-c1)\*r), so the value of f(r,c) shows whether we should add ""n"" or not. In that case it's sufficient to show that if f(r,c1)=f(r,c2) for each 0<r<n, then either c1=c2 or c1+c2=n+1 (for 1 < c1,c2 < n).

The function s(x,c) represents f(r,c) as a Fourier series, we use it later to form d(x) = s(x,c1)-s(x,c2). So it's also sufficient to show that d(x) does not converge to 0 for some 0<r<n. We can see, that's true numerically.

This is as opposed to 2D rotations, which are super easy to understand, since we just have one parameter. Both rotations and angular velocity are a scalar, and we need not restrict the rotation angle to [0, 2pi) since the transformations from polar to Cartesian are periodic in theta anyway.

1m1l33v,Off topic:Would it be worth building a searchable archive of the old Brilliant.org community?,"Hey everyone!

I used to browse [Brilliant.org](http://Brilliant.org) back when it still had a community-based model — where users could post problems, write solutions, and discuss math together. I was just a kid then, but it left a strong impression on me. Recently, I realized how much of that content has vanished since they moved to a more curated format.

Before it was all gone, I scraped and saved a good chunk of those old community pages — problems, discussions, comments, etc. I’ve now cleaned it up into a database, and I’m thinking of building a simple app to **search and explore** that content. Not to revive it, but just to understand and appreciate what the community was like back then.

You won’t be able to submit solutions or post comments — that part of the internet is frozen. But you *can* explore the math, try solving things yourself, or just browse what people were doing back in the day.

Before I dive into building a frontend and cleaning up throwaway data, I wanted to ask:

* Do you think this is worth doing?

Can I establish boundaries for the r(C, G) correlation? Using the fact that the correlation matrix is positive semi-definite?

1m19yc3,What attribute(s) do you find the most fascinating in a theorem/lemma/result?,"Just a question I had as I'm advancing further down the math rabbit hole, since theorems come in all different forms. There's the ""simple but immensely useful"" type to the ones that take up half the lecture to prove. And of course, some will come off as more interesting than others.

Here are some ideas as to what one could value in a theorem:

* The feeling of “mind-blown” that the result even exists - Some of the theorems in complex analysis immediately come to mind.
* Proof is elegant or magical - ~~Hippasus~~ decided “Okay, instead of giving up trying to write √2 as a rational number, I’ll prove it’s impossible instead!” (EDIT: As said in the comments, it probably wasn't Hippasus who used this proof) Then, out comes an elegant use of proof by contradiction that feels like magic the first time you see it. It also remains a quintessential proof used in discrete math courses.
* Practicality/Application - For example, the Sylow Theorems can take problems involving groups of a fixed size n and blast holes in them. In particular, you can use them to prove groups of certain semiprime orders are forced to be isomorphic to their respective cyclic group.
* Generalizability of the idea - When the theorem makes you go “isn’t this a wonderful idea to explore more?”
* Different ways to prove it - Some might find it fascinating that Pythagorean Theorem has hundreds of different proofs!
* History/Lore - There is certainly awe in the 300+ year journey involved in Fermat’s Last Theorem, even if very few people can actually understand the proof for it.

There could be something I didn’t list, not to mention others weigh the attributes differently.",Hitman7128,1752664829.0,71,0.92,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1m19yc3/what_attributes_do_you_find_the_most_fascinating/,/r/math/comments/1m19yc3/what_attributes_do_you_find_the_most_fascinating/,math,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1m169u9,Loss for motivation in math,"A long time ago, I made a post asking about finding a research topic that I was genuinely interested in so that I might have a chance to find a suitable advisor (or even a good grad school). The number of replies in that post was insightful, and I am more than grateful to the people who spent their time answering my post. However, I started to grow doubts about myself, as I slowly learn that the two fields that I like (Numerical Analysis & Computational Mathematics) are not the most commonly known in applied math. I looked up professors who are doing research in either of those two fields, but I can only find a handful of them that fit my interests (in the country where I apply for a PhD in applied math), and the majority of them are from top schools as well. My profile can only go as far as 2-3 research projects (no papers published, btw), a bunch of TA experience, and a good GPA, but I doubt that it would weigh much in a competitive pool of PhD applicants from top schools. 

I'm at a loss for motivation in the two fields that I love the most, but I don't want to throw it away in the dark as well. So I need to know whether it's still worth it to research in Numerical Analysis & Computational Mathematics. Can I still actually find an advisor with these two fields? Is there a chance for me to work with them (as a PhD student) even though I don't have a strong profile? Are the two mentioned fields still relevant in applied math? What can one look for in these two fields? Will it help me find a tenure position?

1m0ktpd,How do you deal with the lack of ideas for a proof,"Hi everyone, 

I am currently in my fourth year of mathematics after high school and heading for graduate school specializing in probability theory and statistics next year. 

I got a 3 months and a half internship at a very good research lab and I am very happy about the research subject and my advisor. We proved some very nice results together albeit most of the ideas came from him.

However there is one last important theorem to prove to kind of conclude the whole thing and it actually seems even harder to prove than the first two main results. My advisor was surprised too and gave me some general guidelines that could work but he said to me that it seemed very difficult indeed. 

So now I'm trying to start off the proof but I have a hard time even getting the idea of a proof scheme, I'm seeing some of the difficulties and why the previous things we did break down in this other case but I can't seem to find a fix to make things work again, I spend hours in front of my paper sheet trying to write things down but nothing really works and I don't write much anyways... It really feels like I'm wasting a lot of time, days even. 

Hence my question, as I'm planning to pursue research and a PhD after that, I was wondering how you were able to handle not having any ideas and how to sort of get out of this slump. Do you start writing down absolutely any idea you have, any property you deduce and try to build something from there? How do you gain intuition into the problem to deduce a proof scheme and get an idea about what the things you will need to demonstrate will be?

1m0g8yw,Reading mathematics to a blind person,"Hello every one, 

I am working with a blind mathematician, and I have to read to him old mathematical essays.

  
Unfortunately, it seems to me that usual mathematical language does not provide enough clarity to convey certain mathematical relations. Notably, there is no difference orally between: e\^{x+1} and e\^{x} + 1; f(x+1) and f(x) +1; x+1/n and (x+1)/n; etc.

Currently, my solution is to read something like 'e avec l'ensemble x + 1 en exposant' ('e with the group x + 1 as exposant'), or 'l'ensemble x + 1 dans la fonction f' ('the group x + 1 in the function f') or 'the group x + 1 over n' 

but this is quite clunky ! Do you have any other options ? Or resources in general for this type of work ?

Another problem is generally stops such as 'AP = x, PM = y, AB = a', where I would rather not say 'comma' every time I see one. 

And another one is of course capitalisation, where there is no difference in spoken language......

1m08mh4,"For people who struggled with math, how did you overcome it?","I'm in college and I am now on precalculus attempt #3. The first two times I tried it I withdrew before the academic penalty deadline, because I was genuinely doing 15+hrs of homework every week and still failing. 

This time isn't going as badly so far but I've yet to take my first exam. I'm doing about 15 hours of homework a week this time around too. I have an exam tomorrow and spent 10 hours on test prep today and I'm still not confident in what I'm doing. 

I've always had a hard time with math. I've heard that practice will help, but so far that's not helping. I have tried taking detailed notes, supplementing my lectures with Khan academy, and doing practice problems until I can get them all right. I've done online classes, in person classes, university tutoring, and personal tutoring through my friends with math-related degrees.

I can spend all day nailing down a subject in math and go to bed feeling like I know it, but the next day it's like it never happened. I will often do a problem almost right and swear on my life it's written down correctly, but the problem is that I dropped a negative sign or mixed up a variable early on. I will check my work over and over and not catch it! I practiced the same subject every day last week, had the formula memorized, applied it dozens of times. I took the weekend off and now I can't remember the formula or recognize when to apply it.

1lzuqgu,Unconditional life in multi-colour Go/Baduk/Weiqi,"I'm currently thinking about unconditional life in multi-colour Go.

The rules for multi-color Go are identical to ordinary Go:

* there are chains of stones and they have liberties,
* a chain is removed if it has no liberties,
* suicide (even multi-stone) is prohibited,
* if a suicidal move would also capture, then it is allowed.

According to a theorem by D. Benson ([Sensei's Library](https://senseis.xmp.net/?BensonsAlgorithm), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benson%27s\\\_algorithm\\\_(Go)), there is a technical definition of *vital regions*, and a chain is *unconditionally alive* iff it has two such vital regions. If suicide is allowed, an alternative definition of vital regions shows that a chain is *unconditionally alive* iff it has two such vital regions under the altered definition. Here, *unconditionally alive* means that if the current player always passes, then the opponent cannot kill the chain.

Now, for n > 2 players with prohibited suicide, an unconditionally alive chain is also unconditionally alive for n = 2 (all opponents always passes except one, this distinguished opponent can capture all third party stones and we have a situation for n = 2). Even stronger, uncondiontal life for n > 2 implies unconditional life for n = 2 with allowed suicide (if one opponent needs to suicide, a third one can capture this chain it their stead and the previous opponent can recapture if necessary).

My claim: **the converse is also true, i.e., a chain for n > 2 players is unconditionally alive iff it has two vital regions.** A vital region of a chain is a connected area of non-black points (including empty points and enemy stones) where every point of that region is a liberty of that chain.

1lzhj10,What is the smallest set of functions that are needed to solve all polynomials?,"It is well known that linear equations can be solved using the four elementary operations. Quadratics can be solved using square roots, and cubics with cube roots. Quartics actually don't require any new operations, because a fourth root is just a square root applied twice. However quintic equations famously cannot be solved with any amount of roots. But they can be solved by introducing [Bring radicals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bring_radical) along with fifth roots.

The natural follow up question is, can 6th power polynomials be solved using the elementary operations plus roots and Bring radicals? My guess is that they cannot. If they cannot, can we introduce a new function or set of functions to solve them?

What about 7th power polynomials, etc.? Is there some sort of classification for what operations are required to solve polynomials of the n-th power? It is clear that we will require p-th roots for all primes p <= n, but this is not sufficient.

Now I know that we could introduce an n+1-parameter function and define it as solving an n-th power polynomial, but this is uninteresting.

1lyrmbv,Inline & Display LaTeX Renderer extension (using KaTeX) (like TeX All the Things),"So [TeX All the Things](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tex-all-the-things/cbimabofgmfdkicghcadidpemeenbffn?hl=en) no longer works on Chrome, so I made a [Tampermonkey](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) script that does basically the same.

You can install it from Greasy Fork [here](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/542419-universal-inline-display-latex-renderer-katex) (note, you have to install the [Tampermonkey extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) first).

---

**This script renders LaTeX math expressions on any website using KaTeX, with inline delimiters and display delimiters. It provides a toggle button to switch rendering on/off.**

*Disclaimer: ChatGPT did a lot of the work here, but I still verified and edited everything.*

*Disclaimer: multiline code is not (yet?) supported.*

---

🔧 Features:

* Renders both inline and display math expressions

* Highlights the rendered expression in color for easy recognition

* Supports multiple delimiter styles: `[;...;]`, `\(...\)`, and `$...$` for inline and `\[...\]` and `$$...$$` for display. You can easily edit the script to add your own or change which delimiter is used for what.

* Toggle button lets you enable/disable rendering whenever you want

* Auto-hides buttons when holding CTRL for unobtrusive browsing

* Only displays the button when a valid delimiter is detected on the page

* Leaves `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and editable fields untouched while rendering is ON

* Minimal and fast — scans efficiently and only activates when LaTeX is detected

---

⚠️ Caution:
Always turn LaTeX rendering OFF before typing into input fields or rich text editors. Rendering changes the DOM and could interfere with form content if left on while editing.

* ""Fix Input Field"" button restores LaTeX expressions from rendered KaTeX, useful if rendering was accidentally left ON while editing and the content got messed up

---

⚙️ Installation:

* Get the Tampermonkey extension ([Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en), [FireFox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/))

* Install this script in Tampermonkey

* Edit the script to your preferences. Most of the things you'd want to change are at the top of the script starting at line 18.

1lyr7n8,"Jean Bourgain, the greatest mathematician known by only a few junior mathematicians","This is a post appreciating the late mathematician Jean Bourgain (1954-2018). I felt like when I was studying mathematics at school and university, Bourgain was seldom mentioned. Instead, if you look up any list of famous (relatively modern) mathematicians online, many often obsess over people like Grothendieck, Serre, Atiyah, Scholze or Tao. Each of these mathematicians did (or are doing) an amazing amount of mathematics in their lives.

However, after joining the mathematical research community, I started to hear more and more about Jean Bourgain. After reading his work, I would now place him amongst the greatest mathematicians in history. I am unfortunate to have never had met him, but every time I meet someone who I think is a world-leading mathematician, they always speak about Jean as if he were a god of mathematics walking the Earth. As an example, one can see some tributes to Jean here (https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/202106/rnoti-p942.pdf), written by Fields medalists and the like.

Anyway, I guess I really want to say that I think Bourgain is underappreciated by university students. Perhaps this is because very abstract fields, like algebraic geometry, are treated as really cool and hip, whereas Jean's work was primarily in analysis.

Do other people also feel this way? Or was Bourgain really famous amongst your peers at university? In addition, are there any other modern mathematicians who you feel are amongst the best of all time, but not well known amongst those more junior (and not researching in the field).",No-Accountant-933,1752408462.0,340,0.97,50,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1lyr7n8/jean_bourgain_the_greatest_mathematician_known_by/,/r/math/comments/1lyr7n8/jean_bourgain_the_greatest_mathematician_known_by/,math,True,False,False,False,False,,False

1lybzae,How to iterate a function a non-integer amount of times,"To be crystal clear on what I mean, here is an example, where f(x) = 2x+1, and we'll let our seed value equal 0:

To iterate our function once would be simply f(0), which equals 1. To iterate our function twice would be f(f(0))=3. To iterate it thrice would be f(f(f(0)))=7, four times would be f(f(f(f(0))))=15, and so on. But what if we wanted to iterate our function half a time, or the square root of 2 times, or pi times, or 4-6i times?

Here I have cataloged solutions I have found to particular functions for f(x), where F(t) is our generalized iterative function, t is the number of times you iterate f(x), x0 is our initial value, and a is just some constant:

|Choice of f(x)|f(x) iterated t times =|
|:-|:-|
|f(x) = a|F(t) = a|
|f(x) = x + a|F(t) = at + x0|
|f(x) = ax|F(t) = a^(t)x0cos(πt)\*|
|f(x) = ax|F(t) = a^(t)x0\*|
|f(x) = x^(-1)|F(t) = (0.5x0 - 0.5x0^(-1))cos(πt) + 0.5x0 + 0.5x0^(-1)|
|f(x) = x^(a)|F(t) = x0^(a\^t)\*|

\*With certain parameters, the formula doesn't work.

I've found that once you include a second constant, b (for example, f(x)=ax+b or f(x)=ax^(b)), it becomes much, much harder to find a general solution. If possible, I'd like to try to see if we can find a general solution to all rational functions and maybe even more. I'm also very curious about trig functions, but I am unsure whether that would even be possible. I'm slightly more confident that a solution would exist for logarithmic functions, but I have my doubts there too.

Also take note that if at least one solution exists, it guarantees that uncountably infinitely many solutions exist. For example, lets say we have a solution F(t). We could change F(t) to F(t)+sin(kπt)z, where z is any complex number and k is a natural number, and our solution will still hold. Of course, it would feel kind of silly adding a function like this to our solution, so we will be looking for the simplest possible solution.",Scared-Cat-2541,1752356662.0,49,0.91,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1lybzae/how_to_iterate_a_function_a_noninteger_amount_of/,/r/math/comments/1lybzae/how_to_iterate_a_function_a_noninteger_amount_of/,math,True,False,False,False,False,,False

Like, _the first chapters of Epps' or Rosen's_!  Plus, there's nothing ""new"" about it. I wonder what other countries had for New Maths? Because I know that, at lease, America had New Maths. My second question is, when did other countries start to roll it out? Because all these subjects that appear in this so-called ""New Maths"" book were taught to us in at the 11th grade under it's _real_ name, Discrete Mathematics, and stuff like sets, they taught us in middle school!

I don't see myself fit to comment on the contents of this book --- however, I can comment on the typesetting. It uses phototypesetting (because I notice no beveling in the scan) but they mix in Persian typesetting with Latin typesetting, like they use 'ُ' (the Persian comma) instead of pipe (don't blame me for calling it that, I'm a Unix programmer!) for set definition notation.

1lxu1br,Correct way to generalize dot product and matrix multiplication to tensor multiplication?,"So I was studying multilinear algebra and I came across matrix multiplication being described as a composition of a tensor outer product and tensor contraction. My understanding of the operations is that a tensor outer product takes two tensors of rank 1 or higher where at least the last index of tensor A and the first index of tensor B are the same size and produces a tensor whose rank is the sum of the two input tensors' ranks, and tensor contraction takes a rank 2 or higher tensor where at least two consecutive indices are the same size and produces a tensor whose rank is the input tensor's rank minus 2. If I understand this correctly, then:

Dot product: rank 1 (vector) + rank 1 (vector) = rank 2 (matrix) then contracted to rank 0 (scalar)

Matrix multiplication: rank 2 (matrix) + rank 2 (matrix) = rank 4 then contracted to rank 2 (matrix)

In a system like

\frac{d\vec{x}}{dt} = A\vec{x},

if  A  is diagonalizable, everything is smooth, each eigenvalue gives you a clean exponential solution, and the system basically evolves independently along each eigenvector direction.

But if  A  isn’t diagonalizable, things get weird, you start seeing solutions like  t e^{\lambda t} \vec{v} , and I’m trying to understand why that happens.

Is it just a technical issue with not having enough eigenvectors, or is there a deeper geometric/algebraic reason why the system suddenly picks up polynomial terms?

Also: how does this connect to the structure of the matrix itself? I get that Jordan form explains it algebraically, but what’s the intuition? Like, what is the system “trying” to do when it can’t diagonalize?

1lx18ir,Why do solving differential equations as opposed to other math seem like plugging in memorized solutions?,"When I look at the problems, I have no idea what methods to apply. 

I practice a lot.

 When eventually I give up and look at the solution, they just seem to know which solution to apply but don't really break down what in the question gave them the idea to use that - or how to start breaking down the problem to find the method to use.

Now, I didn't feel like this so much in CALC I , II , even III.  I understood the concepts at about same level as i did for differential equations (which is to say I feel like I can explain them to a 15 year old) and often I solved questions on those lower math classes just by knowing what formula to use by being familiar through lots and lots of practice. 



But I can't seem to get to that level in Differential Equations.  Even with open book of methods, I can't seem to figure out what to plug in - or how to start breaking down the problem to get to a point where I can plug in a method . 

Is my brain missing something/ am I looking at this completely wrong? 

Is the simple answer just that I  need to practice even more? 

Bonus question : IF all they care about is us understanding the concepts, why don't they provide the formulas/methods?

1lw7tlh,Do mathematicians generally have mental models for everything?,"I'm an engineer by training, but I try my best to self-learn as much math as possible, particularly things that might show up in some engineering papers with a theoretical bent, such as real analysis, functional analysis, convex analysis, measure theory, etc.

I often find that the things I struggle to grasp the most are things I don't have good mental models/representations for. Just to clarify what I mean: this is slightly different from being a visual learner; what I mean is a mental representation of a concept that doesn't quite capture everything about the concept, but is a good heuristic or jumping off point for your brain to just get the ball rolling.

For example, no matter how many times I try to understand what a Borel set is (in its most general form), or what a sigma algebra is, I just struggle to have it nailed down, and I think the reason is that I don't have that approximate mental image in mind. I don't think it's a matter of the 'size' of the concept either - for example, I am comfortable with the notion of an infinite-dimensional vector space. I struggle sometimes with even simpler notions like open, closed, compact and complete sets because I don't feel like I have a mental image of the differences.

The point of this long diatribe is to ask a basic question: Do professional mathematicians 'think in pictures' so to speak, or are they able to get at a problem purely abstractly? How essential are mental representations (however imperfect) to the work of a mathematician?

1lvr3ey,Intuition is a hindrance in higher math,"Hi all.
TLDR: Been thinking about math and my experience with it. I have really good intuition generally, but am pretty bad at higher levels of math, ie hard proofs and such. Wondering if anyone has felt similarly or has anything to say about this!

I am an undergrad studying math and nearing the end of my studies. Although I love math, especially pure math, I have found that my intuition has been more of a hindrance than a help when doing proofs. I feel like I can understand conclusions easily, since they feel right, but can't break them down well. For a silly example, I think of BBC Sherlock vs Psych. Sherlock can break down and explain the steps to his conclusion very easily and in a way that is understandable to others, however the Psych guy is not considered a detective since he cannot break down his conclusions in a digestible or logical way. Basically, i feel like the Psych guy when I do math :/ I always feel I know the answer, but showing how I got there is hard for me. I should've been a scientist instead! 

Aside: Mathematical intuition that is built from experience and exposure is super important and not really what i'm talking about. This helps us think of new ways to solve problems using problems we've already solved. I'm more talking about why i struggle with the way my brain works when i do math.

I'd like to find a few good math books to read.  To help guide answers, let me tell you some things I liked and liked less:

* Similarly Bhargava's talk on BSD from 2016 Abel prize series, also on YouTube
* Mathologer / 3blue1brown are in my top 5 Youtube channels 
* I think I've read all/most of the books recommended by PeakMath series
   * Love and Math by Frenkel is really good, I enjoyed it, but if anything is a bit ""scraping the surface"".
   * The Ash & Gross books, Fearless Symmetry and Elliptic Tales are both great
   * I'm less of a fan of Music of the Primes, but it was still good
* I think best I've read in last few years was ""In Pursuit of the Traveling Salesman: Mathematics at the Limits of Computation"" by Cook, I just really enjoyed how it was written.
* I am (eg) not a massive fan of the Simon Singh books, dont shoot me but they just dont hit the spot. Similarly Ian Stewart's more recent books.  
* It's rare I find a math article (or computer science) on the Quanta website that I don't enjoy reading.

A professor is explaining something in class and when he gets to one part of the proof he says ""this is trivial so I won't bother explaining it.""

A student comes up after class and says ""professor, that part you said was trivial, I don't quite see it, could you explain it for me?""

He starts to explain it, gets stuck, stops, tries again, gets stuck, stops. Eventually the student has to get to her next class so they agree to follow up at the next lecture tomorrow.

The following day the professor tells the student ""I stayed up all night working on this and can confirm it is indeed trivial!""

A mathematician, physicist, and an engineer check into a (surprisingly fire-prone) hotel. All of their rooms catch fire in the night.

The engineer wakes up, sees the fire, sees the fire extinguisher, grabs it, puts out the fire.

The physicist wakes up, sees the fire, sees his blanket, uses it to smother the fire.

The mathematician wakes up, sees the fire, sees the fire extinguisher, sees the blanket, is satisfied that a solution exists, and goes back to sleep.

---

A mathematician is studying in his office when suddenly his couch catches fire. He grabs a nearby blanket, puts out the fire, and keeps studying. A short time later, a book from his bookshelf catches fire. He rushes to grab it and throws it on the couch, setting it alight, and he goes back to studying, satisfied that he has transformed a new problem into a problem with a known solution.

This one's not strictly mathematical but when I was first told it, it involved accountants, so we'll let it slide in here.

A group of 4 engineers and 4 accountants are going to a conference by train. The accountants buy 1 ticket each but the engineers only buy 1 ticket total. The accountants wonder how they'll get away with this and the engineers simply say ""you'll see."" They get on the train, the accountants take their seats, and the engineers all pile into the bathroom. When the conductor comes to take tickets, he knocks on the bathroom door, and one engineer sticks his hand out and hands the one ticket to the conductor.

On the way back, the accountants, delighted with this trick, decide to try it for themselves, so they buy 1 ticket, but the engineers buy no tickets! The accountants wonder how they'll get away with this and the engineers simply say ""you'll see."" They get on the train, the accountants pile into one bathroom, and the engineers pile into another bathroom.

1lvayjf,What should I do when I can't do most of the exercises in a chapter?,"I'm relearning functional analysis with an emphasis on problem solving and doing exercises. I'm using a book where the first chapter is a refresher on analysis and measure theory and the second chapter is about Hilbert spaces. I wasn't able to do a lot of the problems start to finish, but for most of them I at least knew where to start or was able to complete the problem after getting a small hint from searching online. 

Now I reached the chapter on Banach spaces and dual spaces and I was able to follow most of the proofs but I'm struggling with the exercises. I'm only 7 problems in even though I've been working on the exercises everyday for the past a week. Here are some of the problems I struggled with to give you an idea of the difficulty level:

* Prove that l\_p and c\_0 are separable but l\_∞ is not
* Prove that s is a subset of l\_p for all p
* Prove that a normed linear space is complete iff every absolutely summable sequence is summable (I was able to prove one direction but the other one was tough)
* Prove that the dual of l\_infinity is not l\_1 using the Hahn-Banach theorem
* Prove that there is a nonzero bounded linear functional on L^(∞)(R) which vanishes on C(R)

For some of these I gave up and looked up the proof and it made complete sense, but a few days later I forgot it. For others, like the last two, I would have no idea how to start it even if I was given unlimited time.
