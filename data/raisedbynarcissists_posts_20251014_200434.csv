1o6vn4e,"No Contact and worried about ICE, need advice.","This is NOT political, looking for advice from people who are low/no contact with parents. I have been no contact for almost 9 years. 

Trump's newest executive order is that your birth certificate alone cannot prove U.S. residency. You must have that and prove at least one parent is a citizen or permanent resident.

1o6vmvv,My sister cut me off,"I will start by saying this, I don't often cry, ever, but this the only topic that when i think about, I tear up. I am technically an only child. However, me and my cousins used to be very close, in fact, people would joke that we were siblings and we grew up together. We would do what every typical sibling would, play games and watch shows, fight, sabotage, joke but we would always come back together. We were so close, that we even said to each other that we were siblings. Everything was good, Until about 2 months ago. I called her, she declined the phone, I later learned that she was at a guests house, fair enough. Then i called her a day later- still declined and then after and after- same result. Then I was being worried, my ""sister"" had abusive and strict parents, like to the point that if she acted out or didn't live up to her parents high standards, they would abuse her, and not just spanking, full on abuse. The result was that she was very submissive and didn't really have any identity of her own, everything she like, like writing and reading, was forced on her by her parents as they wanted academic hobbies. My "" sister"" is very smart and accommplished, she has been published before and she has won lots of awards. But I have started to feel a sort of drift. She used to tell me everything, and now, I don't know anything about her, I dont know what hobbies she has, what friends she has, what she likes and doesn't like, basically she has turned into more of an aqquaintance. So anyways, my grandma, who is close with my aunt called her. She asked, what is going on? You have been declining the calls, and even when you do pick up, she usually hangs up in 5 minutes. Her response, Well your son ( my grandma is the one that raised me as my mother was often working long hours as an optician) has been taught very nicely how to talk, and he is extroverted, but my kids are introverted and i didnt really teach them how to talk, also what would they talk about, they are different genders, all they could talk about is school, so it is fine if they dont talk very often. By the way, my aunt is very manipulative and she often lies. And that is it, my ""sister"" never calls me upfront, I do and when i do she hangs up abfter about 5 minutes of unintrested conversation about school ( she wants to be a doctor when she grows up, obviously her abusive parents made her). I don't really know anything about her now, she is always studying or with her friends, she makes time for them but not for me, ( i suspect she is lying, how can somone always be stuyding at any given time of day?) But I can not cut her off, i need her, as i dont have any real siblings, she is the closest to a sister that i have, or used to have and i need her back.

1o6vdvo,Affection is really hard for me - sometimes disgusts me…,"I know it must be really hard for my partner, and I know if I was in this situation I would probably leave. Affection just doesn’t come naturally to me if I’m being honest, or at least not often. I very rarely show affection because I genuinely feel the impulse, and I don’t particularly enjoy being kissed on my mouth especially (I think it has become more of a sensory issue?). I also rarely enjoy giving physical touch, receiving it is nice as long as it’s not in specific places/ways of touching. This is also extended to emotional affection where It can get really uncomfortable for me to express affection out loud, and I often come off as cold.

I love my partner and my life would be very hard without them. But they are suffering because of how hard it is for me to show affection. I really wish I wasn’t like this and that I was more.. normal:/ Really don’t know how to fix this.

1o6vckq,raised by a narc or am i a narc?,"so, i haven't posted on here before and for sake of not making a long post, i'm gonna summarize as quick as possible. 

i believe one, if not both, of my parents my be narcissists. i don't know, especially since i love my mom so much and we were doing so much better but i need to know if i'm the problem, and i genuinely want brutal honesty. 

my house has been weird, i'm 24, but i live at home with my whole family. me, my mom, and my sister are the only people who work and i try to contribute to my house. i'll cook for my family, my aunt is gradually developing dementia and cannot drive, cook, do anything really, so me and my sister take care of her. 

a few months ago i had a few friends over for fourth of july, my mom and aunt were away and my sister got super drunk to the point i had to put her in her bed. my dad had texted to clean up. me and my friend cleaned up, the dishwasher was clean so dirty dishes were in the sink. i woke up disoriented to my dad talking about the house being a mess, and wanted confirmation that i would do it. i was half asleep so i guess i didn't respond or respond right and he snatched the pillow from under my head and threw it at me. i took it back and just laid down on it. i guess my non reaction made him angry because he took the pillow back and when i went to take the pillow back he started beating me with it and i was screaming. his phone flew out his pocket and my sister who was asleep had to come rushing in. 

that was long but needed context. this is not the first time he's done something like this, but its always me and it's always when my mother is away or he thinks my sister is not awake. my mom said it was upsetting to her to hear that happened, but after a month passed and i expressed not wanting to speak to him, she said it was stressful for her that i wasnt speaking to him. i expressed that it was my choice and that i didn't want to. i went on vacation with my sister, aunt, and mom, that me and my sister paid for to hawaii. in Hawaii my aunt spilled water and was sopping it up with a plate. i said she should get a napkin and she got upset but waited till my mom returned for her to chew me out in public. i did not yell at her.

with this information this brings us to two weeks ago, in a discussion with my mom about work she said i was bothering her and needed to shut up (this bothered me but bothered me the most because she says this about my father but not to his face, it just was jarring to be said to my face) so i said okay, and left. the following day my sister brought up hawaii and i told my aunt that she can't yell at me in public like that and that next time she does that i will yell back. my aunt yelled at me and my mom told me that i needed to stop. i got so mad that i've been silent. i havent spoken to my family in nearly three weeks and i live with them. 

i'm scared that i might be a narcissist because i'm ignoring them but also mad that no one has reached out to talk about the things that happened like i have when i got the silent treatment my whole life. i've never given the silent treatment to them before, and it doesn't apply to my dad. i have no intrest in communicating with him after july fourth but my mom and aunt i have never gone this long without speaking to them and i feel i have no right to be upset that they haven't reached out when it's me being silent. 

i know my dad is a narcissist, but am i one as well? how can i bridge the gap and stop being silent with them?",arielleluv,1760484669.0,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o6vckq/raised_by_a_narc_or_am_i_a_narc/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o6vckq/raised_by_a_narc_or_am_i_a_narc/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o6uv2g,I got fired from a job my narcissistic mom didn't like. Now she's taunting me.,"She noticed that I was home all weekend. I usually work the weekend, Tuesday, and Friday.

Today, I spent the day trying to file a legal claim against the company for retaliation. While *struggling* with that, my nMom came home from work for her lunch break.

When she realized I hadn't left for work yet, she took the rest of her day off work JUST to taunt me all afternoon:

""I knew you weren't going to last!"" (3 times)

""I told you"" (another 3 times)

""You should have applied to ________""

(Excited voice)

It's like she prayed for my downfall, just to be ""right""

The few hours of mental peace that I thought I was going to enjoy while she was at work was taken away AND instead of receiving support, I was hit with a gleeful ""I told you so""

1o6un4z,I'm putting this here because I want to tell an outsider.,"

My mom has a history of being very hurtful. She ""settles"" conflicts with yelling, is very stubborn and immature. This morning she literally woke up and was getting mad that the dog was stink and that we don't clean the house.

My sister was being annoying and bullying my brother and not doing her part in the chores. When I brought it up, my mom was like ""why you worrying bout your sister?"" and calling me a snitch and stuff. I'm like why are you more aggressive with me? Why am I getting harsher treatment? If she can just dodge chores and go in her room why can't I?

My mom was forcing me to clean the dog so we took him outside and it started raining so i couldn't wash him. He was barking and whimpering all the way up until the rain stopped. My mom starts yelling at me again to wash the dog. I was like bruh but it seemed like she was being wayy more aggressive with me.

So i went in my room and she was yelling at me again to clean the dog. I was like ""fine i will clean the dog."" I cleaned the dog and when i finished i let him in the house.

She was mad i didn't get a towel and he wet the floor. She slipped a couple times because of the wet floor and was like ""you don't care i'm pregnant you don't care that i slipped you don't see what you do."" She was yelling at me in my face to mop the floor as i'm trying to clean myself in the bathroom after cleaning my dog.

I'm like f this cause why are you yelling at me so much. I went in my room and closed the door.

She busted in my room like ""MOP THE FLOOR MOP THE FLOOR GET UP AND MOP THE FLOOR"" and she started hitting me trying to punch me. Then she left to get the belt. I was like ""i can fight back too you're not just gonna hit me!"" and I grabbed the nearest weapon, a hanger.

She came in and started swinging and i was on my bed and i was swinging back. She just kept kept swinging and I was dodging some and trying to defend myself with the hanger and i maybe kicked a little bit too since i was back on the bed. As she was hitting me she was like ""MOP THE FLOOR"" *WHAP* ""MOP THE FLOOR"" *WHAP*.

She was so mad at me and seething in anger and mad mad and then stopped hitting and was still angry. I was done and was like ""fine i'll mop the floor.""

And during when she started hitting me with the belt my sister came in randomly yelling ""I HATE YOUUU"" and i was just so confused as I was getting whooped. Then my brother came trying to defuse the situation like ""Look, I'll mop the floor."" and both my siblings started to mop the floor themselves.

# 

I think I reacted this way bc all these years i felt like she hasn't been the greatest mom. I keep remembering this one time when i was in early middle school - I don't remember it well but my mom and dad took my mattress and was punching me and i had to sleep on the couch. They kept making comments as I was sleeping on the couch and smiling like ""I should not let you watch tv"" (the living room tv).

When I slept in my room on the air mattress and got the laptop my grandma gave me (bc ofc they took all my electronics i usually use my phone or ps4), she made a comment like ""I should take the laptop too."" This is when I was trying to lose weight and i was doing workouts in the living room and my mom was being mean about it.

After this she is talking about how she is still mad that I had the gall to fight back after she hit me with a belt bc as a child I'm supposed to just let myself be disciplined. It was disrespectful and I'm an unappreciative and troubling child.

This morning she kept yapping about how hurt she was and kept repeating stuff she already said and saying I'm not her child and it was just so hurtful like it came off like she hated me.

My ipad, ps4, and my phone are gone and she is saying until I learn to be appreciative i cant get it back. Like I just wanna play 99 nights in the forest on roblox with my friends and finish my hw. I really miss not having electronics but she did give me my laptop back tho so ye.



I feel like she don't actually wanna solve the problem she just wants to be mad at me.

I don't think its really that much my fault. I know I acted emotionally and was being stubborn but she is just going overboard and being downright hurtful. I acted emotionally because I felt like all these years she hasn't been a good mom and now she is getting a small taste of her own medicine and has the nerve to be mad like ""Oh i'm still hurt.""

Also she is mad I'm walking around the house like nothing happened and like its all good after i attacked her. I'm just like in my head ""mom you literally verbally belittle me everyday and act like its all good.""

To me i'm thinking this is another one of her fits but she really isn't letting this mull over. She keeps saying that i'm selfish im the most selfish person ever and she links random stuff to me being selfish like ""keeping toilet paper in my room when we could use it for the bathroom"" - like bruh i just like to blow my nose and wipe things down, u dont buy tissues.

# 

I need a different perspective. She keeps saying I'm the most disrespectful, selfish child and I should have just let her discipline me. She's still mad days later and saying I'm not her child anymore. She links random stuff to me being selfish like ""keeping toilet paper in my room when we could use it for the bathroom"" - like bruh i just like to blow my nose and wipe things down, u dont buy tissues.

I feel like she don't actually wanna solve the problem she just wants to be mad at me and keep punishing me. Am I wrong for defending myself?

**other stuff:**

* I tried talking to a counselor in middle school about stuff and they told my parents and it just made everything worse, so I'm not going that route again
* My mom is pregnant with the forth son which might explain some of the extra anger.
* I'm just trying to survive until I'm 18 and can leave and i wanna b independent and just start making money on my own. 
* Oldest. got a 10 y/o brother and 13 y/o sister.

1o6tu4w,Do your nparents not talk like normal people?,"So, I thought about weird everyone in my nfamily talks.

1o6tpkw,nmom bailed out of my sisters babyshower,"My mom and I have been going in circles with her telling me I need to let go and forgive her + blaming my dad for her abuse, and me telling her to stop deflecting her responsibility and to not contact me unless she's ready to take accountability for her abuse. My older sisters babyshower (first child) is THIS Saturday. I was stressing and nervous about seeing her, but planned on being cordial when necessary and ignoring her otherwise. My partner is also coming so I was feeling okay despite being anxious. Well, my sister just told me our mom canceled her flight. 4 days before the shower. Like she couldn't pretend to be a grown up for one day for the sake of her daughter? Did she think I was going to make a scene in front of everyone? I feel bad that our mom is missing the babyshower.

1o6topg,NC victory! - Family shows up at apartment,"(USA) I have been NC with pretty much everyone from my old town (family, friends, etc.) for a couple of months now. I went NC cold-turkey, though there is one family member (a sibling) who I stayed in contact with during this time and haven't blocked or stopped responding to. A few months ago, I moved cross-country to give myself space to individuate and become my own person, and I went NC with everyone a few months after that.

My family drove about 12 hours (a couple of states over) in order to come and try to find me. Yesterday, they stopped by my alma mater (the college I attended) and asked around to try and figure out where I live. Thank GOD one of the people they talked to was one of my good friends who knows about my situation, and he immediately let me know, so that I could prepare accordingly. Didn't hear anything more about family yesterday after that, and no one at the college told my family where I lived.

Today, a few hours ago, my building manager knocks on my door and lets me know that there are family members here to see me (four people in total, including Nmom and aunt who is a MAJOR flying monkey). So they found my address, and not just that - they must have knocked on some of my neighbor's doors in order to find the home of my building manager. It just really frustrates me that they pulled other people into this when they didn't have to (it almost makes me think that maybe Nmom wanted some kind of audience/outside support to back her up as she tried to cross a line). I tell the building manager that I'm no longer in contact with them, and they decide to just tell my family that I didn't answer. I get one more text from the building manager saying that Nmom left a letter and some other mail for him to give to me.

Just a few moments ago, I get one more text from my building manager, letting me know that Nmom is asking him to go into my apartment to check that I'm alive. He didn't budge (thank goodness) - I feel absolutely horrible that he got sucked into all of this, but I am beyond grateful that he didn't budge on anything. I let him know that I called the police, and the police stop by to pretty much mediate everything. As I call the police, I let them know multiple times that I wanted no contact whatsoever with the family that is here right now, and they reiterated that they wouldn't let my family into my building (and kept that promise!).

So eventually one policeman comes to my building, and I let her in (my family is out in their car - I still never crossed paths with them, and they never saw me) to talk about what's happening. She checks that I'm ok and reminds me that I can contact them (the police) to report harrassment if they continue to bug me, either over text/email/etc. or by coming to my apartment again. She also mentioned the option of a restraining order, which I may end up going through with.

Once things were done, she went back out to talk to my family (to let them know that I am ok, and to explain to them that I don't want contact with them except for one family member that I specified they could ask to see if I'm alive). I think everyone's gone now (my curtains are drawn - I'm just gonna chill out in my place for the rest of the day to be safe about things).

So ultimately, I maintained NC with Nmom and the flying monkey aunt, which is a HUGE victory for me. I feel a lot of power and agency over my life knowing that I just made this decision and stood firm in my decision. I can understand how suddenly going NC with just about everyone could lead the people I went NC with to be concerned, but what I find interesting is that these people had other ways of reaching me (email, calling and getting sent to voicemail since I blocked all of them - interesting that I have no voicemails from \*any\* of them, communicating through the one relative I still have contact with and haven't blocked) before going through the process of driving an entire day to see me in person. It makes me think that Nmom really just wanted to catch me off guard and wanted to try to remind me in some way that she still has some kind of control over me. I am so stressed out about all of this, but it seems to be over for now.",Early-Will4098,1760480429.0,25,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o6topg/nc_victory_family_shows_up_at_apartment/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o6topg/nc_victory_family_shows_up_at_apartment/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o6th79,"How can I love the people who would hate me for what I (dont) believe in?  (TW for religion, suicide mentions) [copied from another sub]","Im (17FtM) gonna come out of my supposed ""no social media"" thing just to vent. I'm fully aware I'm never part of a healthy family, even before I started deconstructing. Ive known queer people before knowing of religious homophobia. Ive enjoyed the fruits of evolution via advanced medicine and the knowledge of it way before I even heard of people being crazy over Creationism.

And at the very beginning, I wasnt chasing God; I was chasing validation. Recognition. Moral support. Someone who wouldnt yell at me for the way I talk, the way i walk, and the way I am to the world and itself.

God, my god, I cant believe theyre this way to me. A small part of myself still believed, still delusional, about them accepting me. Not even just as their son, but as someone worth hearing his opinions on, and someone who isnt a carbon copy of my parents hopes and dreams and desires. Not even just as a child, even...just a equal.

But...I cant fucking take it. They can never love me in the way that truly matters. They only love the 'me' which was long dead, was long abandoned, was long forsaken in favor of this 'bullshit' called ""freedom"". They said ""love the sinner, hate the sin"", as if the sin is not what defines the sinner, and in effect one cannot hate or love just one of it. If my words are sins and my actions transgressions, Ill gladly be in hell for my freedom.

...Im just not doing well with the reality that they cannot change and they were the ones who wanted me to change for them. Im still holding out on the slim chance that they will still love me without their religious biases and their authority preventing them from doing that...but I cant just beg. I cant beg anymore.

I just want to be free. I just want to leave an argument whenever I wanted to. I just want to be heard, to be able to yell, to be able to argue...all without being silenced because I was ""too young"" and ""not the authority of this family"". Im just tired of ***him*** being this horrible to me. Im tired of ***her*** showing that shes the same, or almost, at a more passive level. Im tired of being unable to be at the comfort of my own room without being barged in and have my door be almost broken by him. Im tired of forcing myself to agree to them and their whole religion.

Hell, suicide isnt even a good option at all at this point! If I did myself in , I would lose this chasing game, and they wouldnt still love me wholeheartedly. Yet...I'm tired of all of these.

Why was I cursed with this life? If reincarnation exists, I wished my next life was never this.

1o6tg6g,Triangulation (rant),"I am so upset. I came across some text messages between my mother and father (yes, I was snooping) from about 2 years ago. 

For context, my father has cheated on my mother several times in the past. She keeps taking him back because she loves the feeling of making him feel guilty, feeding her victim complex, and having someone to bend a knee to her every one of her demands. (She insists she did it to maintain a father figure in my life, but also admits that he’s a terrible influence on me. Hmm.)

So back to the messages. My mom used to talk to me about how much she resented my dad, and she told me that she “hates having to save face” for him, due to his messy behavior. 

My dad came to me later and asked why she was acting distant. I told her exactly what she said; “she’s tired of saving face for you”. 

He confronted her in these texts about it. She went ballistic on him, threatened to kick him out, and said (paraphrasing here): 

“You ALWAYS take her side. The kid has real problems, you know. She wants to drive a wedge between us. She lied to you to start drama between the two of us. I will never allow you to take her side over mine ever again. We need to stand together. Oh, and now I’ll probably never go to her for mother/daughter girl conversations ever again. How sad. Now I don’t feel like I have a daughter or a husband.”

Of course, his pathetic self said “Okay, I didn’t realize how diabolical the kid can be. I didn’t know she lied. Can I still come home?” 

Side note, I was 21 and living on my own at the time. They still referred to me as “the kid”. Very telling. 

Also, she mentioned my (at the time) boyfriend during this, saying to my father “You know how she acts. She puts that poor guy through the wringer. He has no idea what kind of person she is beneath the layers”.  That was especially triggering for me, since he was an extremely emotionally abusive boyfriend. 

All of this just makes me so unbelievably upset. I just want them to love me. I’ll never win, I’ll always be their scapegoat.

1o6t4cd,Difficulty with maintaining boundaries,"My ndad is consistently horrible with boundaries and respecting my parenting. It’s caused a lot of strife in my marriage and as a postpartum first time mother, as I am constantly viewing myself as a failure. 

The other day he asked to see my daughter and I said “if you can respect me, my parenting, and my boundaries, you can come over when I get home from running errands.” 
To which he responded with a long winded guilt and shame ridden text in order to make me feel bad and manipulate me, as usual. I responded that this was a conversation better had in person, but I was wrong. It wasn’t better had in person, because I am easily manipulated by him still to this day and I always walk away regretting it. 

This most recent argument came about because he called me a smother and when I told him he doesn’t need to like or agree with my parenting, but he needs to respect it, he said “I don’t respe— I accept it.” Words carefully chosen, not good enough for me. 
We spoke about it and I walked away feeling icky. 
My husband hates my dad. He has every right to as my dad has treated my husband poorly as of late, my dad is awful to me, and my husband feels he is unsafe to have around our daughter. He doesn’t trust him in the slightest and I don’t blame him. He leans extreme on boundaries and that’s where a lot of our arguing comes in, because I’m trying to be reasonable toward an unreasonable person (my ndad). 

I don’t know what to do. I know my father loves me in his own twisted fucked up way, I am trauma bonded unfortunately and because growing up he was the only person I had (bio mom left, step mom was awful to me, sister constantly picked on me and physically hurt me) I feel a deep loyalty even though I know he is not a good person and I don’t feel comfortable with his behavior either and I do worry about my daughter. He would never physically harm her but I don’t trust him to not eventually manipulate her, speak badly about us to her, violate boundaries, undermine our parenting, etc. 

I am lost and hurt. I often tell myself I must be lying about him if everyone I talk to about it views him as evil. I must be the problem if they’re viewing him poorly. And that’s fucking crazy, I literally gaslight myself. 
 
My husband and daughter are my universe. The most important thing in my life is raising a happy child, and I’m terrified if I don’t cut this off that I’m going to lose that.

1o6t18s,I recently started seeing a therapist and told her how my mom is….,"(Throwaway acc) my therapist told me my mom just has a lot of anxiety… and idk if I’m overreacting or if the therapist is right… 

I’ve been stuck living at home and dependent on a sahm who watches tv all day and does dishes… 

My mom has not worked a day in my life that I have personally seen, (I have heard she worked before me that was it) 

My mom often left me with other family as she travelled with my dad who travels for work. 

My mom would never teach me how to cook… I tried making a pancake once and she took the pan and spatula from me like I was 8 even at 22…

She never encouraged or helped me learn to drive she’ll talk about what I need to be doing but won’t actually help me.

Because I have no job, and no money I tried hooking up with some people I went to school with and they didn’t want anything to do with me. Most assumed I was lazy and spoiled. I do look spoiled because my parents would rather buy me a $1k brand new phone than spend $1k on things I actually needed or could have used such as new clothes, shoes etc… 

I personally feel like it was a trying to make me look spoiled so people wouldn’t see below the surface. 

My circumstances makes me look super lousy, I can’t work because I have no transportation and even if I did try to Uber or something I’d be dealing with constant fights about leaving the house to begin with. I don’t have anywhere else to go, they moved me to another state so no family at all to reach out to and help me. I’ve been stuck in this area for years. I didn’t get my permit until 19, and had to redo it because we moved and my mom wouldn’t teach me how to drive. 

I tried to explain to my therapist my circumstances and my therapist really said reach back out to the people that you went to school with (even after I told her they didn’t want anything to do with me) 

Then proceeded to say my mom just has a lot of anxiety 🫠 it doesn’t feel like anxiety to me, I feel like my mom infantilizes me on purpose. She let my sister do whatever. My sister got her license and a car at 16, ran around god knows where and still does even at 30, meanwhile I got stuck at 8 parentfied until we moved because my sister kept getting knocked up and my mom didn’t wanna watch the kids. She’d leave them on me and do her stuff and take the credit about always watching sister’s kids.

1o6sr4u,I'm needing advice on how to deal with familial icks,"Hi, I'm 23M. I'm graduating from university soon and will be finding work. So, I am looking forward to financial indepdence. Right now, I am living away from my parents.

I am planning in to move in with my best friend, and it scares the living shit out of me. These days, when I eat at her place, it feels a bit homey you know. But that feeling scares me because my body anticipates that something bad will happen afterwards. And she's part of my chosen family, so living with her is scaring the shit out of me. We make a good team, but jesus christ, like my body freaks out lol.

Also my mind keeps associating parenthood with mentors. I had a male mentor and whenever the thought of him being somewhat like my dad comes up, I get an ick and I just want to run away lol. He has been more my dad emotionally than my biological dad. We have been friends for two years so now I am pretty comfortable with him and see him as a friend more than a potential father figure. Someone else being a father figure to me makes me feel some sort of shame, as if I'm lesser for feeling the need to have that need, want, or desire. But I wish I had a dad who I could rely on.

Recently, a female mentor type figure has appeared in my life and my mind associates maternal energy to her and it's scaring the fuck out of me. I worked at a company before where I had a female boss and the same vibe started coming so I felt weird staying at the company and hence left. Ofcourse there were other professional considerations. But being avoidant about this all was definitely part of it. But this new mentor, I really would like them to be a part of my life, but my mind starts doing weird fucking stuff like sex dreams and Freudian stuff, but I don't feel it when I am with this person in real life. I wish my mind didn't have to worry about all these associations.

I feel like my life is changing so much when I will graduate. Moving in with someone where I can actually have the home feeling, and I will be financially independent. But the intimacy is so scary. And honestly, I like the intimacy and being loved but it's so fucking scary and feels weird that I want to run away or something, and it almost sounds funny writing this.

I can not afford therapy for a few more months but until then, I really don't know how to deal with this sort of stuff. Any advice would be helpful. Like older versions of me speaking to this version of me. I appreciate the energy it takes to help me out.",Automatic-Living8183,1760478177.0,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o6sr4u/im_needing_advice_on_how_to_deal_with_familial/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o6sr4u/im_needing_advice_on_how_to_deal_with_familial/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o6sl0x,Freshly worried,"Feeling conflicted. My grandma just called and my narcissist dad is scaring her. She says hes drinking and acting more irrational than normal. She told me she overheard him on the phone say to my mom ""but I really love you"" last night. She's hard of hearing so she doesn't know any context, but she said immediately after that he started acting crazy. Yelling at my grandma, accusing her of being passive aggressive for throwing out old food, saying she never supports him.

For what its worth, none of this is new, besides maybe the marital issues. But again who knows about this. 

I just don't know what to do. I've been great at boundaries for the last few years, I dont get involved first hand anymore. But she's saying somethings different and really wrong. And for whatever reason I'm having all the old feelings of needing to fix everything. I cant do that, I know it doesnt work. But now im at work trying not to panic. Like I know i cant call him. I'll get yelled at. And make things worse for my grandma. My mom is at work, plus I cant just call her with something my grandma said. She's not narcissistic on her own,, but she has always defended my dad's every action. Again I also dont think it will do anything but make stuff worse. 

Anyways. This is forever long. But I needed to say it. And I don't want to worry my sisters. What I told my grandma is to stay away from him, and that she cant help him and shouldn't try right now. She's also drinking now, and emotional, so I don't know whats going to happen. I guess if anyone has suggestions or feedback, that would be nice. 



Background info for anyone interested in the long winded stuff : 
my grandma has financially supported my dad through years of ""dream chasing"". I reported suspected elder abuse, because of how worried my grandma is about running out of money, and the manipulation he pulls to get the money. But nothing came from it, and won't unless I file for my grandma to be declared incompetent(i forget the actual term. But unable to take care of herself, handle money, etc) and shes absolutely not. 
And she has tried to put up boundaries for this but always caves because she loves him.  and she lost her other son in a car accident and one grandson in a gun ""accident"", so she's terrified of loosing him too. 
My parents have been married since '88, but havent really lived together consistently for the last 10 years or so. They always say its due to said ""dream chasing"", since my dad is always out of town working on his next big thing. 
My sister and I had a ""intervention"" a year and a half ago, saying he can't live like this. He can't treat people this way. And grandma shouldn't have to support a 59yo man with a masters degree. Nothing changed, which I guess we didn't have any real consequences, and probably why it didn't work. We vaguely said we didnt want a relationship if something doesn't change, but then we havent done anything.

1o6sgki,I grew up with an abusive father and I still don’t know how to let go of the way I learned to survive,"It’s late and I can’t stop thinking about how much my childhood still affects me. My dad was abusive. He’d yell, hit, throw things, and then act like nothing happened. My brothers and I spent our whole childhood walking on eggshells, trying not to set him off. There was never any real peace, just silence that felt heavy.

We were living abroad then. My mom was a stay-at-home mom with four kids, no money, no job, and a family that believed divorced women were a disgrace. She had nowhere to go. He was the only one working, and he used that to control everything. We all depended on him, and he knew it.

When we came back to our home country, it got worse. I became the one he took everything out on. He’d disappear for weeks, then come home acting like nothing happened. He’d use money as a way to punish or reward us. You couldn’t win with him. Ever.

My youngest brother ended up just like him. Same temper, same manipulation, same coldness. It’s like watching history repeat itself, and it breaks me in ways I can’t even put into words.

When my dad died of cancer, I cried, but not for him. I cried for the relationship we never had. For the version of him that could’ve existed if he wasn’t so full of anger. It’s a strange kind of grief when you’re mourning what you never got.

Even now, if someone yells at me or tries to control me, I shut down or I fight back. My brain still thinks I’m that kid who had to defend herself just to survive. I used to say I’d rather die fighting than feel powerless again, and honestly, that part of me still exists.

Some nights it just hits me how much he ruined, and how unfair it is that we’re the ones left trying to fix what he broke.",Candid_Post9138,1760477486.0,5,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o6sgki/i_grew_up_with_an_abusive_father_and_i_still_dont/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o6sgki/i_grew_up_with_an_abusive_father_and_i_still_dont/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False

Every transition it goes from winter to spring or autumn to winter, i'm frantically going on a hunt to find my jacket and trainers, or my winter coat (with scarf, winter boots, hat, etc.) because the spiel always goes like this: while i'm at work, my mum will take the everyones then-out-of-season outdoor clothes from the coat hanger area (she'll even clear out the out of season shoes out of the shoe box), stashes them in some undisclosed location sometimes with the help of my dad M50. So now it's coming up to winter, i'm starting to feel the cold going right through my piddly spring jacket and the rain soaking through my trainers. I try to find my winter coat, boots and the rest in one go just so I don't have to do round 2 of wild goose chasing... 

I shit you not, this year she's made it extra difficult because as it's turns out my coat and boots were up in the loft (fine, at least I expected that), but then I find that my hat and gloves are tucked away in my mum's wardrobe which was... random to say the least. and I still can't find my scarf. I ask her where she put it and she said she dosen't know and has the audacity to tell me that I should know where my own stuff is... how tf does she expect me to know where my things are when she keep moving them from where they should be anyway while i'm at work!? At this point i'm pissed and I tell her the immortalized words: ''Please just don't move my things. Why can't they just stay in the hallway?'' She always says no because it 'looks' too cluttered to have both sprint and winter things in the hallway. Meanwhile my tiny shoebox bedroom and wardrobe is litterally cluttered and stuffed to the brim so I have nowhere to put my jacket, boots, etc. even if I wanted to. I asked if she can at least remember where she put my scarf and she dosen't have an answer... Am I crazy or is it really too much to ask to just not move around peoples things and not tell them where they are. Or at least remember where you put it. My dad is not helpful when it comes to this because he always says if it's not in the loft, he dosen't know.

It's a longshot, but are there some magic words that I say to her to convince her to not move my stuff?

1o6s2dw,I cut my hair and finally realized I was nothing but her doll,"If you saw the last one it was a misclick on an unfinished version of this post sorry

For the past 2-3 depression cycles of this year alone, I’ve realized that my hair was unable to be saved or salvaged. It was beyond needing help and such as majority of it was completely dead and it was contributing to my migraines as of late. I’ve been holding onto it for so long since my mom worked so hard on it to have it grow out and be long and pretty. 

She was so obsessed with my hair like no other. I originally went against cutting it because I wanted to prove her wrong, she always said whenever I wanted it to be just short enough or if I wanted something new that “you’re not gonna find anyone like me to do your hair, and when that happens all you’re gonna do is cut it all off and look like a bald guy for the rest of your life. We both know it won’t grow back as fast as the last haircut”. Her exact words by the way.

I couldn’t do it. I can’t do the high maintenance of my own hair at that state nor did I enjoy that process. I’m more of a one and done person where I’d rather take a shorter time on hair if I can. Plus the maintaining was more expensive than anything else and I am currently nowhere near being able to afford it constantly and as strenuous as before. I have been no contact and far away from my entire bloodline for almost 3 years now and I’m slowly just finding out more about myself in that short time than I’ve ever had since growing up.

The first snip not feeling like an impulse or a punishment, felt so freeing. Like I was finally letting go. I kept going and going till it got low enough to line and shape to more of a taper fade. That much of my hair was dead. I’d post an image but I still suffer from self image and stalking so for my safety I won’t unfortunately, but I feel like I did a pretty good job. It was a huge change for me and it was very emotional, I felt like I was being freed from my mothers ongoing hold even tho she wasn’t there, but I also felt like my beauty was disappearing. Memories of her telling me how much beautiful my hair was and how everyone would be jealous of my hair because of her “hard work” put into it, kept coming back. Yeah people were amazed but never super jealous. She was the one gassing it up. 

There’s been many times my hair days were forced upon and I had to drop everything and sit there till she finished or got too tired. Whenever I wanted something different she didn’t like, I’d be stuck with a strange or almost tweaker looking hair I’d had to go to school with. Till I learned to cater my hair choices more to hers. My nana and grandma did the same thing. (Nana kept giving me undercuts but refused to help me learn to upkeep or do my hair at 10 and 12, my Grandma kept silk pressing it and overbear with 800 ways to keep my hair and if I missed a step I couldn’t go outside till I remembered to do it) 

My hair was always a project, or an experiment for them to play with, like I was a bratz doll fresh out the packaging every time. The only day I got on my hair was color, and sometimes length if I was “good enough” by being an extreme overachiever at school or overworking myself out for the month till cramps felt like an itch to me. And even then those choices were limited (she never allowed red, and I couldn’t keep it shorter than my shoulders or longer than my waistline) I never truly got a full day of my own hair all this time. And it frustrated me. All this time, my self image and appearance wasn’t even my choice. 

I was micromanaged from how I dressed, to what I put on my face, my skincare, and it went as far as my hair?! Even when it came to personal parts I had to follow them to “have my stuff right” (wearing 3 layers of shapewear just to wear a dress, only wearing undergarments they personally pick out for me, concerns about pubic hair!!?, etc) in fact, everything they did was their way of dress up with me, especially my mom. All disgusted as “I didn’t have this as a kid so I’m giving you a much better childhood by doing this” which I believed until I was no longer a child and she kept doing it. I cried on my 20th birthday because I got slutshamed for an outfit and hairstyle I wanted to wear myself and they had no say in with my own money.

I finally get done with my hair and I feel so free, my head hurts less, and it feels so surreal that I did something I wanted to do with my own appearance. Especially my hair, the longest war I’ve been fought over had always been my hair. I plan to burn the pieces when I’m off to fully let go of it all and enjoy my new look. I can be versatile without being uncomfy and experiment with wigs at the same time. I still feel shaky on feeling beautiful and I know it will be a while till I start truly feeling and believing it, but I won’t let my mothers Barbie doll dreams and expectations of MY body take hold on me anymore. This is the first step of me finally getting into self care for MYSELF this time, and not because I need to look perfect anymore. I am finally going to look like me, and how I want me to be. 

Sorry for the long post. 
TLDR: Realizing how narcissistic and extreme my mother and grandmothers were when it came to my appearance while cutting my hair for the first time in ages on my own, only to realize I was their doll and not their daughter.

1o6qtrt,Is this financial abuse?,"I’ll start with the context…my dad(M48)had me (F28)when he was 19 years old so he was given social housing from a young age. He managed to keep this place until I was older. When I fell on hard times and lost my home after university my dad said I could live in this 1 bedroom flat. Every month I was sending him £750 towards the rent which I assumed was being paid. 

Fast forward a few years the local council turn up at my door at 6am saying they are taking the property away and I need to move out. That I haven’t been paying the rent and I’m also not the person on the tenancy agreement so whoever has been subletting to me has been scamming me. 

I called my dad about 100 times and when he finally answered and I explained the situation he admitted that he hadn’t been paying the rent and had actually been using the money I was sending him to build a house in our home country. I was devastated by the news. 

He was very apologetic and tried to find a new place for me to stay but it was of course a lot more expensive. As I was packing the contents of the flat I caught covid which meant I had to isolate and no one came back to the property so I ended up staying a little longer. 

Today was the court day and they have ruled they are taking possession of the property from my dad. I’m a single woman with no kids so I am not a priority which means I’m about to be homeless. My dad has said sorry but he’s just going to fly back to the house he’s been building and I’m left to deal with this situation. 

All the people around me are telling me I should be really angry with my dad as this is a type of financial abuse and he technically stole from me. 

As I’m not on the tenancy agreement I’m trying to see if I can plead my case to my local council and see if they will allow me to stay and take out a fresh tenancy on the flat as I’m estranged from my mother due to N abuse and my dad was taking the rent money and using it for him own gain.

1o6qrhp,A reminder to never forget someone's past actions,"Hello everyone I am back after 1 year since my original post. Unfortunately this isn't some update regarding the last I think but I may be proved wrong.

So, this post is mainly about my mother since a year has passed and I thought things have changed for the better with them (at least they kinda did with my stepdad). My mother always kept herself busy attending whatever events she can find from work related to friend outings and I was busy with university but we did share little time together and it was not that bad.

Now , I really dislike this one thing about myself, I tend to forgive and forget and go back to square one; \[ I did start writing a journal about all these or how I'm feeling at all to navigate , and ofc I keep it hidden\]. That and the fact that I love my family a lot and I care about them.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Now to the main plot and I will try to keep it short:  
My mother refuses to acknowledge her past accomplishments because she is focusing her life solely on one exam\[which would let her work in a domain\]  and gets envious and mad when someone\[my sister\] questions her husband \[my stepdad\] in said domain because he has more practical experience.

I kid you not, we had a whole makeshift trial to try and clear my sister's intentions because she took it personally and started calling herself a failure and bringing her past up. I told her repeatedly that not acing an exam is not the end of the world and she should not undermine her work. **I get ignored, everyone gets ignored.** I'm too stubborn and I tried to keep going but I got mad as I do not like getting cut off in a conversation but all of my family members present took the liberty to do that. I reached a boiling point and I was trying to leave when *my mother then threatens to drunk drive if I didn't come back* \[this happened a lot when I was younger but it was never drunk driving, wtf\]. I went back, couldn't even get my point across due to the same outcome and at that point I didn't give a shit and went upstairs despite the complains.

I was feeling so hurt and mad about the way I was treated that I teared up, I felt like dog ,but hell even the family dogs get treated better. My sister came to somewhat comfort me telling me that she did that because if I pissed off mother I would end up way worse. \[she has been through a lot with our mother, far more than me so yeah..\]. Mother comes after us and tells us to come downstairs; my sister kinda drags me until I stood up and we went downstairs. At last I manage to get my point across but I forgot I was talking to a brick wall apparently. That's when my sister left and not long after I left too.

To be honest, I'd like to get a wakeup call to remind myself that this person who I trust is so engrossed in her opinions that everything else doesn't matter. I might also add that she , in the past: confessed to manipulating me and my sister; Compares her past with our and said that we don't have anything to be depressed about; Talked to me about my sister wanting to tear off her family when she and our stepdad got into an argument years ago *DESPITE* just hugging my sister a second ago and telling her that we will manage ; and other stuff like that.

  
I know I shouldn't be judging someone based on that as I can't possibly put myself into her shoes. Yes she has things that she isn't happy about but is it necessary to go this far? Also I'd wish I had a reminder about this since the notebook ain't cutting it.

It really sucks that I don't have the option to move somewhere else , or even to work for the time being. And even my scholarship got cut off due to issues with funding so I 100% depend on them.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Also another thing I will be putting here which boggles my mind. I have no idea why my friends like my mom, like literally want to date her or some kind of joke. They know bits of how bad she is but still... wtf?

I regret every hour of every day that I let go my soulmate. How my parents wouldn’t bear the thought be me being happy or having friends or even talking to anyone. I kick myself everyday for that. 

I read somewhere that how an old lady couldn’t forget her love and would dream about him her whole life and finally when he died at 70 the dreams stopped for her. But she never married and spent her whole life like that.

Do you ever get out of such regret? Do you ever find your tribe? You people and ever be happy? 

I was never allowed and never allowed to have any friends or be happy in someone’s presence so making friends, of be frank to someone or be in a happy relationship is very unnatural to me. To see the issue and problem in everyone and everything was the only thing discussed in our house where I grew up. No one used to smile. I remember my soulmate noticed how my lips used to tremble when I smiled for sometime because the muscle were not used to it.

1o6owmo,I can't standy nMom at all,"See Growing up I loved my mom. Believed everyttshe said blindly. Always defended her. When she went though tragedy of loosing her husband, I supported her. Pulled her out of dept(or so I thought). Dedicated my li fe to her. 

In our culture if you are a widow you are not allowed in a lot of religious stuff. I always fought for her, made sure she got the respect deserves by a woman.

In my  formative years she made.my.life amliving hell because apparently she did t want my step dad to spend on my education.

I went through 3 major nervous breakdowns aged 16-18 and all my hair turned white by the time I was 18.

Couldn't focus on studies at all, basically brain would go nitmb when I saw books. I developed this phobia of studying: examophobia(google it)

Tried to seduce me when I was only 16yo that left a mark on my psyche.

Didn't have any friends (don't have any even now) because of her promiscuous behaviour or her aggressiveness. She once got very angry only because I received a couple of calls on .y birthday. Till this day I don't celebrate my birthday 

Everyone agreed I was a bright student and would outshine anyone given a little support but never got that support.

She still bad mouthed me to the entire family said things like I am not intelligent or that I am a drug addict or hyper sexed up and would go after anything for my gratification. Basically destroyed any relationship incoyld have had with my family. But they were flying MONKEYS.

I was danm good at my job (companies fought each other to hire me, they were ready to even buy out whatever contract I had going) but couldn't handle it because I was tooo afraid of being judged so no performance reviews.

She convinced me to marry not for love but for money (not that she let me do that too after I agreed)

When she got cancer, despite the fact that I was going through a divorce and bankruptcy (both because of her) I supported her as best as I could. And even after that she would bad moutb me to all. I use to get calls from her flying MONKEYS worried that I am not doing anything for her treatment. Despite the fact that my own health insurance lapsed be ause I didn't have money to pay for it

Even during her treatment she knew I was struggling through my divorce and was bankrupt, yet she got all her flying MONKEYS to give her money but she never told it to me. I found out because as she was in operation theatre I saw the payment receipts on her phone.

Been on anti depression and anti anxiety meds for the past decade 

My first wife warned me about her but I refused to listen and got divorced.

Realized she had psychological issues so room her to psychiatrist and then therapy but she just used it to score sleeping pills 

Got into drugsbefore my second marriage it was my wife who saved me from a downward spiral 

Now we live in the same house (I live on first floor she in ground floor) but I don't even feel like looking at her, just a glimpse of her fills me with disgust or an unyielding spite. Honestly I do t feel anything for her anymore.

She even created a huge rucus, called cops on me more than twice as tried to have me arrested only to scare me. Tried to have my second wife arrested too. Infact she literally paraded her in front of cops just to show she could imagine my humiliation. Used to.come to my room and complain of phantom pains which were always negative when we got her all those expensive tests.

She never wonders where the money comes from, just that I give her all she needs. At one therapy session she even convinced the therapist to make me give her money every month despite the fact that I wasn't doing well financially.

Today she acts as a victims which everyone believes and have forgiven her for everything and it's all normal now, but I see that monster and I am genuinely scared of it.

 Someone please tell me I am not the a**hole.

im particularly upset because i already lost my father. he was physically very abusive whilst being a diagnosed narcissist with aspd (psychopathy). i cut him off recently. so now, accepting how alone i am is really really hard on me.

1o6npxo,Problems w widow mother’s relationship with new widower partner,"My mom (a widow) started dating a guy named Jeff (a widower) a year and a half ago. It is her first relationship since my dad’s death, and his first since the death of his wife as well.

My father passed away in 2018, whereas Jeff’s wife passed away two years ago. So Jeff and his 3 adult children, all older than me (29m), are newer to the loss of a parent / partner. 

My mom has, in my opinion, pushed the boundaries with her relationship with his children, to the point where she is spending Christmas with Jeff, his children, and Jeff’s grandson. But that’s unrelated to me and my mom can make her own decisions regardless of what I think of them. 

My problem is that I feel pressure from my mom to foster a relationship with Jeff’s adult children. Which I personally am not interested in at all. For example, she wanted to have dinner with my girlfriend and I since we haven’t seen her in a while which would’ve been great. But she invited Jeff and his adult son Tim. If she invited Jeff, i would say that’s totally fair and not a problem. Jeff is my mom’s partner currently and I don’t mind having dinner with him and getting to know him better. But my mom texts me last minute and drops on Jane (my girlfriend) and I that this week is the 2 year death anniversary of Jeff’s wife and that this dinner is “very special” to Jeff and Tim. I just feel like we are crossing a line here from my perspective and also that I’m being involved via my mom in a situation I don’t want to be in.  Not only that, it feels like she is using us as additional support in a selfish way to comfort Jeff and his son as a means of strengthening her personal bond with them. 

I have a very fractured relationship with my
Mom due decades of issues surrounding my father’s decline/ passing, her overstepping of boundaries historically, and her intense anger and emotional volatility. I’m not entirely without fault either but these are factors that have made our relationship more challenging. 

Losing my father and regretting the time I did not get to spend with him has left me with guilt and regret. I am actively trying to work on the relationship with my mother so that when she inevitably passes, I am not left regretting the years of resentment and distance in our relationship. So with all that being said, how do I tell an emotionally volatile, prone to anger, Nmom that I don’t want a relationship with Jeff’s kids (ideally no dinners lol) without triggering an insane fight.

1o6nk8d,"I finally realized my mother is a narcissist, but I’m really struggling with it. Advice welcome!","My mom’s always been…. Difficult to deal with. I have a lot of trauma from my childhood and teen years from the ways she treated me and the things she’s said, but up until recently I would blow off her fucking awful and hurtful words saying “she loves me/she’s family/she’s my mom” but it’s just getting harder and harder. Like growing up whenever we would have arguments she would say AWFUL things (I was adopted, and she would bring this up frequently in arguments such as “we spent $40k to have you, I could’ve bought a car instead of you,” just nasty shit), but because I grew up hearing her say it, I never really saw how fucked up it was until my partner happened to be present for an argument like 5 years ago and was like…. That’s not normal for someone to say in an argument. From there I’ve tried to deny my mother’s actions internally or just brush them off… I’m just at a place where I can’t hand wave it away anymore. 

This still carries over to this day. We recently moved to a new city, and pretty much immediately my mom is coming up with reasons to be angry or upset to try and reclaim her control. She was mad at me for not letting her know I was at the airport, flying, landed, or home (my partner knew all of these things and I genuinely had a stressful travel day, I just forgot to mention to her I was at the airport to go home), THEN she was mad bc in her words “I don’t ever reach out to her first” and then doubled that down with “I feel like the only time you ever reach out is to ask for money.” I can count on one hand the number of times I’ve asked her for money in the last 5 years, they were usually really rough times in my life. I also call her weekly too, so it’s not like I never fucking talk to her. During this same phone call she used the Classic “I’m not mad I’m just disappointed” phrase which lowkey made me laugh, because like cmon that’s so cliche to say 😂 She also tried some insane emotional manipulation tactics in the call like trying guilt trip me into being closer to her again and that “family is everything..” 

On top of this, I recently came to the realization that I was trans mtf/non-binary, and I changed my pronouns on fb and insta to they/them. I did it not knowing it would be public (dumb to assume, I know) and she called me about that and said “I support you, but you’ll always be my son, you’ll always be a gentleman, you’ll always be (deadname) to me.” 

Sooooooooo. I just, idk I’m really at such a loss for what to do here or how to even approach our relationship. It’s at a point where talking to her just gives me such severe anxiety and brings back bad memories for me…. But she’s also my main connection point to my grandmother still (who I am very close with) as she’s helping her a lot with care as she’s getting older. 

I just feel so stuck here in this relationship bc I know if I was 100% honest with how I felt and told her in no minced words “you’re a narcissist and it is effecting our relationship” she would deflect, blame me, or just gaslight/manipulate me and just outright refuse to change. But then at the same time I just desperately seek her approval, which I suppose is exactly what she wants from me… it’s just tough. 

If anyone has any advice for me I would appreciate it. ✨💛

1o6ni40,Fought over cotton buds today. How's your morning/evening?,"For context, I was asked a while ago not to touch the remaining cotton buds/q-tips (there were four remaining), and I agreed not to (even if my own ears are really itchy). 

Parent used said cotton buds, forgot she used said cotton buds, and then blamed me for ""using"" said cotton buds/q-tips, stating that she ""saw me"" using it, when, again, I didn't because I knew this would happen. Then, when I kindly pointed out that she used it first with her ears and another when she cleaned her eyes due to eyelashes causing problems, she went balistic. She started raising her voice, saying I don't understand and that there were only two remaining (of course there were two remaining, she used it 😒), and that I used it because she saw me. 

When I pointed out that she was the one who used it, she'd claim that she ""remembered"" not using anything, and that she only used it ""once,"" then, because Filipino parents tend to use this tactic a lot, started pushing that she ""must've been the idiot,"" and that I'm ""obviously the smart one! So smart that I failed college,"" and that she's ""obviously the one who used it.""

Parents are weird 😐👍

  
  
To the curious ones, here's the gist of what she said in Filipino:

1o6lvpr,I just want to cry and it feels stupid but it isn't???,"My mom's always been shit with boundaries, I have to repeat myself over and over for her to accept the answer or for her to stop doing the thing but today was like worse than it's ever been and I'm so frustrated 

She came into my room to bring me my laundry (which was outside my door and I was about to get it myself) so I was like oh thanks? And then she came up the steps to give it to me and I thought she'd leave by that point but then she walked into my room to clean up the garbage and recycling I was going to take out and I was like ??? Ok??? 

For context I have boxes I'm trying to put away in my room because I just moved back but my chronic illness makes it hard to do much of anything so it's just a slow process. 

She starts going through my boxes, through my bags, taking things out to put elsewhere and I said hey please stop doing that. I had to say that 10+ times and she was like no I have to and I said again, please stop and she repeated herself and I repeated myself and she starts going ""I don't want rats and snakes in this room and I'm trying to move boxes so I can have a party in the (downstairs) living room"" ok babe, first off half the stuff in the living room is yours, second, the living room is useable 100%, nothing is obscuring walking space, third, you moved my shit up two flights of stairs making it that much harder for me to put them away on my own??? After I asked you not to move them for that specific reason??? But I was like all I can do is keep asking her to stop. So I did. I asked her to stop going through the boxes about 7 more times (so 17 times total now). After the fifth time she kept going ""see I'm putting them down"" whilst actively taking things out of boxes to put elsewhere. So I was like hey I shouldn't have to ask you to stop 10+ times, that's not normal and she looked at me with genuine distress and was like ""no but I have to help you"" and I was like no if I needed help I would ask for it (also this is why I don't ask her for help lol) and so again I asked her to put the things she had down and to stop going through my things and she said ""most people would be thankful for the help"" and I was like I'm thankful but I'm also asking you to stop and you won't and I don't appreciate that"" to which she replied ""so you think I'm worthless "" 👁️👄👁️ girl...what

So eventually she negotiates and she's like ""give me 25 minutes I won't go through those boxes"" and I was like fine because I just wanted her to stop and I wanted her to leave and I was tired? So I tried to set a boundary or whatever but idk 

She cleaned up my room, which wasn't that messy to begin with but she feels entitled to just go through my stuff because it's her house and that apparently justifies it 

It's like on the one hand this behavior is childish and not ok, and I feel like being upset is reasonable bc she's genuinely insane, but idk I feel stupid crying because my mom wanted to clean my room? 

The real kicker was on the way out she was like ""well thanks again, it was great to see you"" as if she didn't cause me emotional distress for 30+ minutes that I had to mask away because like I don't want to hurt her feelings somehow?? 

Like I know she's 100% abusive and toxic and shit I just gravitate towards I want some kind of relationship with her vs cutting her off because like sometimes she's super nice and we have good interactions it's just like emotionally I don't feel safe or secure that she's going to be nice it's always a gamble and I'm trying to adjust expectations and it's hard

1o6log5,My father has successfully flipped my siblings,"So, being the eldest of 3 sons, I should be used to being the ""scapegoat"" by now, but my narcissistic father's latest caper has got my blood boiling.

I recently made a major change of faith community to one that he left long ago in favor of another, and this has become a fresh new reason to alienate me and to villify me to my brothers, accusing me of condecending behaviour toward them, a total lie. He obviously feels threatened by me, since I am able to blow his every debate strategy completely out of the water, exposing both his stupidity and ignorance easily. In retaliation, he has exploited my brothers' years-in-development suspicion and mistrust of the faith community I am now part of (built by my father's narcissistic world-building indoctrination) to leverage them back into his narcissitic kingdom of total control.

My narcissistic father has long used religion to manipulate and control his entire family, all the while living a completely hypocritical life himself. He styles himself a man of deep conviction and yet makes no effort to ever change his offensive, abusive, and despicable behaviour.

The faith community he belongs to is a narcissist's dream. He went so far as to go back to school after he retired to become credentialed to be a preacher, because he loves the adulation, praise and attention the man on the platform gets every Sunday morning.

Meanwhile, I am the only son who has kept his faith, not wanting to lose it on account of an abuser like him, although my brother doesn't want to have anything to do with faith at all, and its all because of our narcissist father.",ABinColby,1760462414.0,2,0.75,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o6log5/my_father_has_successfully_flipped_my_siblings/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o6log5/my_father_has_successfully_flipped_my_siblings/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o6lig5,Finally understanding the scapegoat’s choice to go no contact,"
Only recently I started to question whether my older brother and I are actually survivors of narcissistic abuse from our Nfather.
Reading this sub, studying books about it, and going to therapy have all made me look at my family dynamics completely differently. With that being said, I want to share my story and ask for advice to understand things better.

From what I’ve noticed, I was the Golden Child and my brother was the scapegoat.
I understand we went through a lot of trauma in childhood, but I confess I never allowed myself to look at it from the perspective of narcissistic abuse.

My brother went no contact with my parents five years ago. I had no problem with him until that point. I started feeling resentful toward him for disappearing like that, as I watched my mother suffer from his distance while my Nfather used it to reinforce his speech about how my brother was a bad, ungrateful person who had no consideration for his family.

I remember asking my father several times not to talk to me about the issues he had with my brother because it only hurt me emotionally, but every single time he saw me, his mission was to convince me how bad my brother was.
And eventually, it worked. I stopped talking to my brother and distanced myself completely, believing my father was protecting us. I couldn’t realize that, in order to be emotionally well, my brother had to cut contact.

He even stayed away from his own child, my nephew, because my parents became very close to the child’s mother, using the narrative that they were “offering support” that my brother couldn’t provide. But as a scapegoat who had gone no contact, it only caused him to distance himself completely including from his own child— and eventually, my nephew’s mother also started seeing my brother as a monster.

Last year, I finally had some kind of confirmation of my father’s narcissistic behaviors.

I won’t go into details about what he did to my brother, because honestly, I don’t know my brother’s side of the story. But I can share the behaviors he showed toward me, the “golden child,” hoping you can help me navigate this better:

	•	He raised us as atheists, but in my early 20s, I started joining spiritual activities. I respected his atheist point of view, so I never brought up these subjects around him. But I also married a Catholic person, so in every opportunity my father started throwing his opinions at me. He kept reminding me how the universe was created and that anyone who believed in God was schizophrenic, delusional, and not to be trusted. In fact, he said I could never trust anyone but him.
	•	When my husband competed in his sport, my father once told me it was too dangerous and that I would end up married to a disabled man, because he would probably have an accident and never be able to work again.
	•	I listened to all of this and kept it to myself for years. I felt sorry for my parents and guilty at the idea of being more distant. I told myself: “I don’t need to distance myself from them. I can handle this. They’re not the worst people in the world. I won’t be like my brother. I’m an adult; I can tolerate this. I have to honor them and love them more so they don’t suffer so much from my brother’s absence.”
	•	Well, that ended badly. I got depressed, and when I started therapy and medication, this is what I heard: “You’re probably unhappy in your marriage. People only go to therapy for that reason. We gave you a perfect childhood, so you don’t need therapy. You’re not depressed. There’s nothing wrong with you. Don’t believe what your therapist says or you’ll end up like your brother — his therapist put all that nonsense in his head and made him hate us.”
	•	I continued therapy and medication, and as my psychiatrist guided me, I began to see everything clearly. And my Nfather began to prove to me who he really was.
	•	The last time I tried to set real boundaries with him — telling him not to talk about my brother with me anymore, or I would stop talking to him — he played his final card. He tried to convince me to change my marriage contract to “protect the family’s patrimony,” because he was sure my husband would eventually cheat on me. His reasoning? “Because your husband is good-looking, and that’s what men do. One day he’ll betray you and try to steal our money.”
	•	That obsession with my husband only started when my husband began distancing himself too. My father never attacked him directly, but my husband said he always felt uneasy and couldn’t explain why.

Recently, I reached out to my brother again. I couldn’t tell him all of this yet because I didn’t want to make things worse.
But understanding his distance — and his pain — has brought me peace and freedom to have my own point of view.

I hope someday we’ll be able to talk about all of this.
And I want to say: I’m deeply thankful for all the scapegoats who have shared their no-contact stories here. You helped me heal my heart and change the way I see my brother and my entire family.

As for my mother, whom I haven’t mentioned much — she’s very submissive, confused, and depressed as well.
I hope that, in time, she’ll be able to see it too.

1o6kvhe,Is this normal parenting or what?,"I’m not sure if this is just normal parenting or a form of discipline, but here’s my story. I’m a 22-year-old nursing student currently in my graduating year. I grew up in a traditional Asian household, so naturally, my parents are very strict—especially my mom. Being the youngest daughter (I also have a brother), I’ve always been under her close watch.

Recently, my mom and I had a huge argument—probably the worst one yet. It was the first time I saw her break down and cry so much, right in front of me and my boyfriend. To give some context, my mom has always disapproved of me being in a relationship. She never expected me to have a boyfriend because I used to hide it well—until last week, when she caught us together in my dorm. That discovery made her furious, and I feel like it completely destroyed whatever relationship we had left.

Honestly, my view of her had already been damaged since childhood. I still remember my birthday when she found out I wasn’t one of the honor students. She got angry, yelled, stormed off the dining table, and left me sitting there alone in front of my cupcake, crying. It happened twice, so I stopped liking birthdays ever since. When I tried bringing it up to her later, she denied ever doing it and said she never cared about honors.

I also remember when my nanny caught her cheating and told my dad. Instead of feeling sorry, she lashed out at everyone—hid my iPad, slammed doors, threw things at me, even broke her phone. My dad was hurt, but he stayed silent and endured everything just to keep the family together.

There was another birthday when I asked for a black electric guitar, but she insisted I get the pink one because the black one looked “too boyish.” I agreed because it was her money anyway. Another time, my brother ran away after being caught taking money from her wallet. He was missing for two days, and when he came home, instead of being relieved, she got angry. My dad had to remind her to be thankful he was safe.

I also remember waking up to find all my makeup—gifts from my brother’s girlfriend—broken and used. She’d rushed to work and didn’t bother apologizing. When I confronted her about it, she got mad instead. Growing up, I was always doing chores, and if I missed even one small spot, she’d blow up, curse at me, and slam doors, saying she wasn’t blessed with good children.

She always talked fondly about my brother—how she missed him as a child, how he’s changed—while never saying anything good about me. My brother and I get along well, and we both share the same feelings toward her. That’s why he became distant. Even when he was reviewing for his board exams, she would constantly criticize him.

One of the most painful memories was when she told my college friends she wished she had aborted me because her pregnancy with me was painful. She said it while laughing, and I was just stunned because she’d never mentioned that to me—only to my friends.

There are so many more things she’s done that I probably can’t remember anymore, maybe because I’ve grown numb to them. But to share some of the more recent ones—when I decided to seek professional help, she interrogated me, asking why I was depressed. I told her it stemmed from my experiences with her. She got angry and started comparing her own hardships, saying she had it worse because she was bullied and had a bad relationship with her own mother. I tried to tell her that comparing our pain invalidates mine, but she wouldn’t listen.

Eventually, she did agree to help me find professional support, but she remained strict about my medications—telling me when I should sleep or scolding me when I stayed up late, even though my nursing workload requires it. Her constant nagging made me feel pressured and discouraged me from taking my meds properly. She even said other people had more “valid” reasons to be depressed than me, which I just brushed off.

More recently, when my phone got stolen, she blew up again—because she paid for my internet plan. For two weeks, she gave me the silent treatment, slamming doors and banging things loudly. She’s done that ever since I was a child, and to this day, I still flinch whenever she does it.

And now, after that huge fight about my boyfriend, everything has worsened. She’s back to silent treatment, slamming things even while I’m studying. I dread going home these days. I don’t feel safe there anymore. I’d rather stay longer in my hospital duties or internship than go home and endure her constant anger.",Getmynuggets,1760460656.0,8,1.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o6kvhe/is_this_normal_parenting_or_what/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o6kvhe/is_this_normal_parenting_or_what/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o6knul,My mum told me she doesn't want me to change my legal name.,"Hi everyone, 2nd time round here. This most recent event has caused me some deep stress in my mind and I am struggling to sleep right now. Hopefully sending this here will help me sleep better.

So for a little context. My mum and I got in an argument recently over her inviting someone to my birthday that I didn't want. And it ended with me being in the wrong of which I 100% agree with being wrong. And will be apologising to the person I had invited. That is on me. Then she sent a letter. Saying that she doesn't understand why I want to change my name legally. And how I was always deadname. During her entire letter, not once did I find my real name. Only my deadname.

I am trans, I do not associate with the name I was given at birth, as that is not me. And her weird excuses of not wanting me to change my name. Like causing confusion about who I am? It redefining how I look legally, governmentually, and in every signature I will ever write? 

She also doesn't want me to change it because it overrides the legacy of when she named me? And that it is a privilege for me to have that name? And how naming a child is one of the most important thing a parent can do? This stuff is so confusing to me.

What can I do? She doesn't view me as myself. And she made it so hard to try and convince her.

Tldr: Mum doesn't want me changing my legal name. In ways I find so incredibly confusing.",nekomusume-nyaa,1760460183.0,49,0.95,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o6knul/my_mum_told_me_she_doesnt_want_me_to_change_my/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o6knul/my_mum_told_me_she_doesnt_want_me_to_change_my/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o6k5zy,"Hey, I may be the luckiest person on this planet!","Raised by a narcissistic mother, I don't remember a day in my life when I felt safe around my parents. ('You have always been like this, you never liked us even when you were six.' The real chaos started when I was 12 with sexual trauma to which she was an accessory, I was protected until my father died when I was 17 and then our house was invaded by her relatives - including my abuser- to whom she was a complete doormat. I built my life elsewhere to the best of my power but as a scapegoat it was hard to watch them gathering around my father's money while I was being forced to be a parent to dysfunctional relatives who were blatantly trying to con me - thank you, uncle! 

During my teen years, I had bad toe nails. I was embarrassed that they could be fungus because my mother had always been a beauty freak so judgmental on so many things. I had long learnt not to share anything with her. 

Around 4 decades later, only when I had built my complete independence did I find the courage to seek help for ailments that I found embarrassing. 

And (listen to this!) it was never fungus! I was born with a rare genetic disease (tuberous sclerosis complex) that causes intellectual disability, developmental issues, epilepsy and so many things in 80% of the patients. I was probably born with brain tumors and have lived with them all my life. It seems I'm a very mild case. My neurologist said I would have tumors but looking at my condition, they could be kept under control. Kidneys and lungs are troublesome at my age. 

My heart breaks for every child who were too uncomfortable to share their ailments with their narcissistic parents. BUT I FEEL SO LUCKY THAT I MANAGED TO MAKE IT THUS FAR WITHOUT DIAGNOS IS AROUND HER. My whole life would have turned into another horror story even if it was a mild case. I feel calm and courageous now because a) I am at an age when things do happen b) I have full control on how I wish to arrange my matters. Prefering some form of peace to physical health could have been fatal and I still cannot believe my new life story. 

So, friends, please remember: Time is more precious than we realize in the midst of their chaos sometimes. Get out at the earliest opportunity and don't be stuck with their carrots. And those who are not as lucky. Please please hang in there but access health to the best of your power. Then come here and receive support. We are together in this and we all deserve so much better. 

P.S. My mother is very elderly - still, I'm going NC for a final time because this is the time to protect myself.

1o6jqj8,Trying to hold boundaries with parents as my grandma is dying,"Longtime lurker, first time poster here. I (28F) am an only child. My dad is the N and my mom the E. I ran away from home as a teenager and have been pretty distant with my family since then, putting up with bare minimum holiday visits and not rocking the boat. Sometimes I’ll get coffee or lunch with my mother, who I still care for and wish I could have a better relationship with. Her mother, my grandmother, is a fantastic human being. I spent a lot of time with her as a child, and we were best friends. She had a stroke a few months ago and has been saying that she’s going to die this year.

When she had her stroke, my mom had my NDad inform me over text. Never missing a chance to guilt trip, he texted me that my grandma was not doing well, I should see her soon, he gives her a week to live, and my mom could use a shoulder to cry on. He added “Btw... do NOT  mention that I said anything to you. Let's just leave it to your thoughtfulness 🙄” (he actually used this emoji three times while informing me of my grandma’s impending death). When I called him out on his tone, he said “sorry, but FUCK YOU and your lame lifestyle. I am DONE with you” and the classic “no child had a better life than you” line. I get a text from my grieving mother about my dad and I arguing, saying that she couldn’t bear to tell me and asked my dad to. It was in that moment I realized the depths of this man’s narcissism. That he wanted me to play this game where he hadn’t told me, even though she literally asked him to. That he took this opportunity to swing at me, and then turned around to cry to his wife who was processing the fact that her mother was dying, and make it about him. I ended up blocking his number for causing such ridiculous drama in a crisis.

I got lunch with my mother about a month ago to talk to her about this, because my birthday was coming up. I showed her all the things he said, and thought we were on the same page. I said I would consider unblocking him but he is not to text me about family emergencies. I did not actually unblock his number. Which was great, because yesterday as I’m in the car on my way home from a trip out of town, I get a text from my mother asking if I had unblocked him. She says she had him text me because my grandma was in the hospital. I said I thought we went over this boundary. She said that she understood where I was coming from but did not necessarily agree. I told her that boundaries are not something you get to disagree about, they are something you can choose to respect or not respect. I told her that it is their loss if they can’t respect my boundaries. This struck a nerve and the entire conversation began to revolve around the “your loss” thing. She said she won’t tell me anything about my grandma anymore so that “we aren’t crossing any boundaries”. The whole text sounded like my father speaking through her. I told her that she was willfully misunderstanding me because she did not like what I said, and that her updating me about my grandma was not a problem. She left me on read.

This whole experience just feels like a nightmare. Losing my favorite relative while having to navigate old trauma that I felt I had put behind me. Now I feel iced out of any updates because my own damn boundaries have backfired. There is no winning with these fucking people, and it feels so awful to be grieving every family relationship at once in its own way.

1o6jgly,I'm having a Hard time Understanding my Ambivalence around my Malignant Narc mothers Death.,"I""m not ""glad"" she's dead, it's this really neutral feeling, which makes me feel like a monster.   I don't really feel anything, maybe dissapointment, anger, depression for all the losses. Pain and a sense of deep frustration , maybe anger,  because she...........NEVER.......... held herself accountable.   Before she died , she looked at me and said ,""so, I was a good mother, right?""  And I said ""no"".   Now most mothers would react with sadness, pain, right?  No, instead she smiled, then asked   ""what?  what did i do?""  While still smiling.   I didnt answer her, why bother?.  Why feed the monster?  And I was STILL upset when she died.  I can tell this is going to be one of those complicated griefs.   

My brother is in charge of her stuff.  So he asked me at one point if I wanted her clothes, and I said yes?  So he brought like 12 contractor bags filled with tons of her shit that she bought to fill the empty hole inside her, and for some reason, I had to see it.   Then I realized as I was looking through literally piles of practically unworn new clothes....that this was going on when I was struggling to buy groceries.     Brand new shit, this nonsensical color palette of obviously impulse buys, while I was practically starving.     

So, I dumped it all.  I could have sold it, but I couldn't stand being around it.  It made me feel.........like I was handling toxic waste.   Like this shirt was more important that I was.   This purse. These pair of pants. 

There were a few things that I took for myself. A stuffed tiger that I bought her, to ""save"" him from the mean ladies house that barely looked at him.   A little glass bird, another attempt symbol of rescuing someone small and defenseless.  I know I""m super weird.   You'd be too, if you were raised by a sadist.  

But the clothes?  Brand new sheets?   I tossed the lot-donated everything.   Wondering why I needed to do that?   And then I remembered why I needed to do that.  I remembererd that when I was a little kid, she was not only cruel but absent, a lot.   I was alone, a lot.   So, when she wasnt' home, I used to go through her clothes, her drawers and trinkets, as a way to be close  to her.

1o6jd7f,Advice for recovering from financial abuse,"I feel like this sub is the only safe space lately. I made the mistake of posting about my wealthy narc parents in a poverty subreddit and got dumped on by people there.

Here's my story

Grew up with controlling narc parents. Didn't teach me any career/financial skills, so I ended up ""dependent"" on them. I put that in quotations because I haven't received money from them since I was a teen. I've learned that they will hold help against me, so I haven't asked since high school.

What happens when you grow up with narcs? You end up marrying one. In my case, I wasn't legally married, but in a 10 year relationship, where again I became completely dependent on them.

I got diagnosed with ADHD at age 27 and after alot of growth and therapy, I broke up with him at age 31.

Now I have a scattered resume, what feels like a useless bachelor's degree (communications), 30k in student loans and about 10k in credit card debt. Most of the credit was racked up during the breakup (hotel stays, flight home, mailing my belongings home, refurnishing an apartment).

I feel completely stuck and have noone to talk to about it. Everyone in my family is just ""get up off your ass and work hard!"" Which will magically get me financially independent. Please please give me ANY advice. 

Thank you all so much for your support and understanding.

1o6j8sh,Slowly realized I was raised by narcissists,"My husband has been telling me for years my parents are narcissistic but I never wanted to believe him. Between my mom who likes to compare herself to me, claim my kids as her babies but never makes an effort to see them (they’re 18 and 13). We moved cross country to be near her when my oldest was 6 weeks old… when she was 2 1/2, she and her husband moved back to where we had moved from leaving us alone… always whining she wasn’t close to see her grandbabies. She recently moved back because my sister moved to be close to me and my family and left her alone. She rarely makes an effort. If I don’t talk to her constantly, she assumes something is wrong and I’m mad at her to the point she’s calling my sister about it. I recently accomplished something she had wanted to do and never did, she said congrats then went on and on about how she wishes she’d been able to do it, etc.. making me feel like crap and not wanting to celebrate. My dad is just as bad- he lived with my family for 12 yrs and is a hoarder and refused to follow the agreement that we made when he moved in. My husband was discussing with him and he mentioned something about my childhood and my dad went on a rant about how I was lying and none of that ever happened (he my mom and my sister all tell me all the time that things I remember from my childhood that have caused me trauma never happened). He ended up moving out telling everyone we kicked him out (we never did that- he just didn’t want to clean his room and stop cooking in there).

1o6ih73,Why is it that they treat you like a kid but pressure you like an adult?!,"My parents are this way with me. I'm a young adult but they love to infantilize me, treat me like I don't know any better and shouldn't make any decisions of my own. Yet, they expect me to be a perfect adult, especially when it comes to things like college, the cars, responsibilities, etc. They tell me stuff like I should succeed and take care of myself as an adult and look towards moving out. Yet they don't actually like it when I do so!

I don't even know where to start. A recent example is that they were about to literally drag me out of a bank cause I wanted a bank account of my own. They had already told me I'll have to buy a car for myself in a few years (and I do want a car of my own) yet they don't want me to have my own bank account and I'm supposed to ONLY use the shared account my father SUPERVISES.

And then another recent example is that I've started cooking more since my mother insists to do it all the time. She's less tired when I cook and she's supposedly glad that I'm cooking more. Yet,  I made a spicy salsa for the first time, and instead of being proud of me, she sermoned me for making spicy food (since she doesn't like me consuming certain foods). Like wow you want me to cook more but don't want me to make my own cooking decisions??

There's no winning with these people. They'll never trust me no matter how hard I try. I always assumed they didn't trust me because I wasn't pushing towards my independence, yet in reality they've been the main factor holding me back now that I'm realizing. I've been slowly losing hope that I'll ever be able to prove anything to them. I don't think I'll ever understand what they want from me, and I'm quite saddened I don't get to have parents who are proud of me when I grow up.

1o6ifx6,Threatening parental email,"There have been six months of near quiet after telling my parents I wouldn't be responding to emails. Their emails were re-directed to a special inbox folder and left unread. My father circumvented the filter by using a different email yesterday.

The email was full of unpleasant comments describing my mother's six month depression during the past six months. She has been ""weeping inconsolably for hours each day"". This is blamed on my lack of communication, especially not contacting her on mothers day or her birthday. (The country where I live now observes a day for mothers in a different month. She usually expects joyful gratitude, or at least some communication on *both* days.) I also usually receive terse 'orders' from my father to send email, or to call, before her birthday, their anniversary, any kind of event.

A few days before my father sent his first text ever to either of us, but it was to my husband. My father sent money for our anniversary. I've not felt comfortable with my parents sending cards and various things for my marital anniversary. We don't live anywhere near each other, and in the country where I live now (and my partner's culture,  as well as my own) wedding anniversaries are for the married couple. (Plus their children for a major milestone, like 30 or 50.)

My husband replied that we aren't really comfortable with continuing to receive money for something that we celebrate just between us. This request to send the money back triggered the spiteful email. This morning I had quite a panic attack. He calls my behaviour ""inexcuseable"", and cites holidays or events I've failed to ""celebrate"" that haven't even occurred in the past six months. Christmas is in December, not anywhere from May to November.

Rationally, I knew he is pulling levers, trying to bully me into doing what my mother wants. She is using her own manipulative tools - being highly dramatic, then waiting for my father to report this to me. He claims I reject her ""care"", ""concern"", and ""love"". But this is also the woman who doesn't remember the name of the chronic illness I've had for over a decade, and even after all this time, hasn't made any effort to learn about it. (I've provided ample resources, she's just not interested.)

I want to be able to reply to this email, and close down the conversation. I want to reclaim the relative peace I had for six months away from this constant durm und strang. But at the same time, the emotional manipulation is very successful. I feel awful.

1o6dxrz,Age does not change the Nmother.,"The narcissist is a black hole sucking in anything that comes too close. Psychology explains what a narcissist does to their children is toxic.
I  had watched it happening right before my own eyes in my childhood experience, I was taught to accept it and that this was normalised. Sometimes that internal rage who in their right mind would come up with a torture based family system the fucking Narc would that's who. The Narc will do everything they can to hide what they are doing to their own children. This is so toxic for a child they sometimes can turn on themselves from all the torture. My brother took his own life at 25 years of age, I grieved for a very very long time for my brother and there are still moments for me today 25 years later even after a decade and half that I still feel the pain. I can see now that the family system crushed him and he and he found his freedom. I find it hard to accept at times but I respect that this is what he needed to do to turn off the pain. I will always love you my brother. The Narc mother today still shows no accountability. I don't know what the Narc feels is it shame or guilt or even rage do they feel anything at all. Still i see the Nmothers  manipulation of family members, the gaslighting and the scapegoating.

Because I am so angry at her, I can't seem to resist losing my patience and insulting her, telling her what I really think of her. Her response is exactly what you know it is and I know it isn't healthy but I can't seem to stop being angry at her and for my younger self. She isn't the only person. I had a high school teacher who I not only absolutely couldn't stand, I was almost terrified of him but I kept my opinions about him to myself at the time because if I didn't, he would've made sure of that and I regularly bring him up as well. 

My mother is always telling me to move on from the past and while I can mostly, it doesn't stop me from going back in time. Sometimes I wonder if I should just send a message to my teacher on facebook telling him what I really think of him despite it not doing or influencing anything. A week or so ago one night my mother lost her shit and screamed at me that she is sick of me insulting her and putting her down while I just stood there staring back at her with a straight face and responding in a low normal voice. 

I know it's not healthy but I can't ""get over it."" and I'm not the only person to have this problem. My uncle sometimes calls up his father for the sole reason to insult him which might sound like immature behaviour but I can't help but relate to him. I've told my mother what I thought of her many, many times. I struggle to even say hello to her when I visit not for her but for her cat and because my grandmother who I live with doesn't want me all the time.

But I never got the opportunity because all my interests and all my talent were squashed.

You think Taylor Swift would be where she is now without rich supportive parents? Hell No.

1o6d1pg,A word of encouragement for you today,"I just wanted to come out here today and tell you that yes you were raised by a narcissist and you probably have gone through frustrations, guilt, confusion, feeling drained, exhausted, lost, like your opinion didn't matter, you were not given enough opportunities to choose, you've learned not to stand up for yourself and be assertive. You might have struggled with codependency, people pleasing and lingering anger. You might also have struggled with confidence and self-esteem most of your life. BUT this is what I came to tell you today.

You're the most resilient, courageous and empathetic person there is. You are strong, and you survived all this pain and abuse. Sometimes things might look hopeless, you might feel completely desperate, but understand that some people might not have survived what you've been through. You're not just a survivor, you're a hero. So today please put on your hero glasses and see yourself for who you truly are: a superhero.

You are stronger than you think, and I believe that one day it'll all make sense. Maybe not today, but one day, one person will need help that only you can give. Because your capacity to endure and love as been refined like gold in the fire.

You matter, your life matters and I'm thankful that you exist. 

The pain might have distorted you a little but it didn't take your value away. The same way a bill doesn't lose its value when it's crumpled. The same way a diamond is valuable when it's covered in the mud, you're the most precious person. And yes regardless of who sees your value or not, approves or validates you or not, your life is so precious.

I know it can be so lonely sometimes but I just wanted to come out here today to tell you: you're not alone and I see you. 

As you're finishing reading this post can you just tap your own shoulder and say out loud ""I'm so proud of you, you've been through so much but it didn't destroy you, you will get through this, I love you"".

1o6cotg,how to overcome guilt of doing very normal things they wouldn't approve of after moving out?,"hi everyone,

a while ago i posted here about going on study abroad for my masters and how my family (specifically my NMom) were not on board at all. we fought for months with a lot of verbal/emotional abuse + threats of being kicked out before my mom finally relented after realizing i was seriously planning to go no matter what.

despite being in an entirely different continent, she still tries to exercise a significant degree of control over me. she gets mad if i dont call her at least once a day, or text her when im home. if i havent texted her by like 7pm she spam texts me yelling at me to get home, so i've made a habit of texting her lies about being home on nights i'm staying out late (for a concert or whatnot). she doesn't have my location or anything so it's just really her having to trust my word at this point.

last week i was supposed to travel to the UK for two concerts by my favourite band ever but i panicked abt the concept of leaving my host country without my family knowing so i signed up for a conference in the UK with my friend/classmate and just lied about the duration to comfortably attend one of the shows. i missed the second one because my friend (+my mom tbh) wanted us to fly back to our host country asap, which i regretted it a lot. even staying the extra day in the UK for the show (which was three hours away from where my family thought i was) yielded abuse over text about how ""she sent me to study, not explore europe"" which is crazy bc she didn't send me anywhere. i chose this path and she had nothing to do with it. now i'm thinking about making a trip back to the UK to catch two more of those shows in glasgow and manchester because i have friends there + it was a really cathartic experience. realistically there's no reason for anyone to find out -- my location is not shared, i can just text and call as usual, and if any of my family living in the host city want to see me i can just tell them i'm busy/reschedule. but i am so scared and anxious and guilty and nervous and it makes no sense. 

i guess tldr; how do you navigate or push past the discomfort that comes from lying or withholding information even after you move out? i don't want to feel like i need approval or permission to enjoy being alive or travel during study abroad like my other classmates. any advice is appreciated. i still haven't booked anything even though i'm meant to leave in 2 days because of this anxiety ",FancyAddendum5638,1760440614.0,3,1.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o6cotg/how_to_overcome_guilt_of_doing_very_normal_things/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o6cotg/how_to_overcome_guilt_of_doing_very_normal_things/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False

1o6cgjm,Im 22 and living with my toxic mother is destroying me,"Hello,
I'm a 22-year-old boy from Romania. I'm writing this message after a very bad fight with my mother, who gets angry about absolutely everything. I write more to vent.

I've lived with my mother since I was a little child, my parents have been separated since I was 9 months old. My relationship with my father is okay.

Actually, the problem with my relationship with my mother is that she always wants to be in control of everything, she's done that with me absolutely my whole life, she's interfered with everything in my life. Sometimes, like today, she has some nerves that she can't control and she screams and curses at me extremely badly.

I'm already ashamed to go out on the street because absolutely the whole block can hear her when she screams. She takes out her frustrations on me and blames me for everything that happens to her. She's angry that I don't want to do anything with my life, go to work or anything else.

But I want to, the problem is her, I can't do anything when she's in the house, I live in a state of alert and stress always when she's upset. I want to leave here as soon as possible because I feel like I'm going to get lost. I need space for myself to breathe. I don't have the resources to move.

My dream is to live alone and make money to support myself from something that brings me satisfaction not only on a material level because that is not the goal for me. I am passionate about spirituality, music, I listen to almost all types of music and I feel that music heals me.

For about a year now I have been going through a spiritual awakening, I read spiritual books, watch podcasts, meditate almost every day. And even the arguments with her had an important role in discovering this passion of mine.

I also wanted to say that I worked in one place after graduating from high school, for about a year and since then I told her that I would not go to any job as long as I stayed with her in the house. Because my payday was an ordeal for me, she always had to get over my money, our money situation is not exactly good. I come from a modest family. But it amazes me how closed-minded some people can be.",WorthBuy9874,1760439878.0,1,0.67,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o6cgjm/im_22_and_living_with_my_toxic_mother_is/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o6cgjm/im_22_and_living_with_my_toxic_mother_is/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o6betr,I'm scared my childhood has left me too unstable to work. But I need to work to leave my family but I feel like I can barely function how do I manage?,"Background: I (20mtf ) am someone who has unfortunately not had the greatest childhood. A lot of shouting, slamming doors and threats alongside not having anyone to talk to when I discovered i wasn't straight or cis (I'm transgender).

Going to university (international student in Australia) I realised the extent of how abnormal my childhood was and after a collection of lowkey traumatic incidents caused directly by them, since the start of this year I have been working to try secure employment as a software developer so I can go no contact with them.

At the moment alongside school I have been doing contracting work with this company / startup since their CTO reached out to me after I met him at a networking event. The contract should have been simple in theory and the guy reassured me that even though 2 weeks of time was allocated I should be able to implement the system in a few days. I think he was trying to reassure me that I wouldn't feel overwhelmed but instead I think it did the opposite because I've beating myself up over not completing the task in the ""few days"" even though I am a university student doing this part time and had to do a lot a self learning to get to grips with their architecture and best practices.

I had school stuff so I was only able to spend 10 days on the project instead of 14. The project is fundamentally finished and it does technically do what it's supposed to do. However I feel like the UI lacks the polish that I wanted it to have and the user flow is clunky. That coupled with my brain mutating the innocuous comment about the project supposedly being ""easy"" has caused me to have breakdowns over the project. I'm going to meet the guy tomorrow to present my work and get feedback on the UI and even though I can tell myself that the core functionality of the app is there. It feels like I did the bare minimum and the lack of polish will hurt my chances of further work with the company. It has been incredibly hard for me to find any sort of internship / tech work getting an internship here so I can stay in Australia rather than go home is really important to me.

My partner tells me that I'm doing well and I like to believe so as well but I can't shake off the constant hypervigilance I've gained from my childhood and the constant fear of disappointing people. I'm really scared that if I am being this neurotic over a 2 week contract which the guy probably doesn't even care that much about I won't ever be able to hold down a real job and I won't be able to support myself. I want to help others through a journalling app I built to help myself and I have ambitions to turn it into a bigger project/startup to extend its reach. But I'm scared that if I can't even function like a normal person in an ordinary job how can I even think of doing something extraordinary?

Deep down I know that the answer to many of these things is to just suck it up and keep going but i really would appreciate advice from people who have been in my situation before.",closetCase76,1760436331.0,9,0.92,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o6betr/im_scared_my_childhood_has_left_me_too_unstable/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o6betr/im_scared_my_childhood_has_left_me_too_unstable/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False

1o6b5o2,I don’t know how to handle my narcissistic mother anymore,"I got married this year, and there were a few things my mum wanted to happen that we chose not to do. She went livid and became even more calculated, manipulative and a consistent bully to me. She was rude to my now-husband, constantly disrespectful, and made him feel like he wasn’t good enough for me.

Despite everything, we still tried to include her. She came to the wedding menu tasting, wore a different colour on the day, and we even made nods to her in the speeches.

Before the wedding, she insisted it had all been a “big misunderstanding.” I told her it wasn’t, that she had been disrespectful and out of line, and needed to stop twisting things to make herself the victim.

I’m now pregnant with my first child, and instead of being supportive, she’s acting cold and distant. I’m in my first trimester, struggling with symptoms, and she hasn’t shown any care or interest. She claims I hurt her around the wedding and rejected her, but the truth is she’s the one who hurt me and my husband.

Part of me wants to protect my peace and keep my distance / go NC before the baby arrives. But another part of me still craves maternal love, especially now that I’m pregnant and becoming a mother myself.

1o6anvg,Parents Can Spend £10k+ on Golden Child and Won’t Even Support My Basic Needs,"I had an argument with my egg donor this morning, don’t even want to think of her as my mother.

During the argument I said to her that for so long she and the rest of my family have not provided me with basics repeatedly. My family has a comfortable amount of money, but they love to act poor. I would freeze during winters in school because they wouldn’t get me a coat even though I repeatedly told them I needed it because I was cold, my friends would lend me their coats and buy me gloves because we were just kids and broke and couldn’t walk into a shop picking out one with no money. I had next to no clothes for a long time, I’d have to rewear dirty clothes because they just wouldn’t give me enough. Wouldn’t get basic hygiene things I needed like shampoo, soap/body wash (my family themselves are really unhygienic). I told my egg donor that she couldn’t support me with any of those things when I was a kid and she was the (wealthy) parent, but my broke older sister who was a student herself instantly got me all the things I needed when she realised how I had nothing. She doesn’t live with us and she IMMEDIATELY realised how I did not have basic needs, while my parents ignored them for years upon years.

At the same time, my parents spent £10k+ on the enabler golden child’s wedding: super expensive wedding hall, paid for his honeymoon, rented out dozens of very expensive sports cars, gave him everything he WANTED, not needed. And my egg donor said to me “fine, if you’re so ungrateful keep going to your sister if you need things”. Literally zero reflection on the complete neglect she and my sperm donor showed. Now she’s listening to some dumbass abusive parent defender podcast about how children are ungrateful to their mothers when they ‘brought them into this world’.

1o6aejj,How should I respond to my nmum?,"My nmum is filing for divorce and I'm still in touch with her husband (not my father). Her still-husband texted me the other day informing me my mum had now filed for divorce (I knew it was coming) and how sad he was that she was withdrawing more and more and that they couldn't work things out or even remain friends. He checked in with me again if I was still happy to stay in touch with him, because he didnt want to put me in an awkward position. I told him that as long as he's comfortable, I'd be happy to. We text each other a couple of times a year, so nothing much. And it's usually to talk about arts projects or birds.

Well, my nmum, who I am LC with, texted me this morning and this was her message:

""Dear X, I had to further reduce contact to [soon-to-be ex husband]. His behaviour towards me is exactly like the behaviour of people I read about in books about narcissists. Therefore I now have to contact all the people I care about. I'm sorry if you are being dragged into our separation, but I think you can probably handle it. Love you""

I feel like this is elementary school level bullying she's doing here trying to rally everyone against him. He's not a narcissist in any way. They've been together for 10+ years and I always wondered how since he is such a gentle spirit.

So I'm thinking either ignore her message, say ""please don't involve me in your relationship issues, I'm staying out of it, thanks"", or say that and add something about how her rallying up everyone against her is not a great look or something. Any thoughts or other suggestions?

Also curious to hear she seemingly reads lots of books about narcissists and isn't making the connection that that's exactly how she's behaving...

1o68o03,My story // I am so disappointed with the state of my golden child younger brothers life.,"Warning: this is going to be a VERY long read. 

TLDR: I was the scapegoat and my brother was the golden child. After being formally diagnosed with NPD and meeting a man who enabled her behavior, my mother left me with my abuser as a minor and started a new life with my GC brother and her new man. My mother then destroyed my brothers life in an extremely calculated way. I feel that he is trapped. And through it all, he doesn’t even feel that he is being abused because he has access to our family in a way I never will, and he is shown love in a way that I never was. He has now aged into adulthood with no footing whatsoever and I am so disappointed, sad, and disgusted by what my mother did to him. 

I guess i’ll start off with some background information. 

I have a very unusual and unique family dynamic in multiple ways. I would say that both my grandmother and my mother maintained a golden child / scapegoat family dynamic throughout my entire life. With me being the scapegoat, and my younger brother being the golden child. 

I will also say that my mother and my grandmother have a very tumultuous relationship. The only time they weren’t fighting was when they were agreeing to abuse the scapegoat (me) as a team. But ultimately, my grandmother never stopped treating my mother as an overgrown child. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I can’t tell you why that is. 

So… i’ll start with some basics about my upbringing. 

My mother had me at 21 and had my brother at 24. We were thrown back and forth between grandma and mom like a football during our early years. 

After multiple incidents with CPS and a 6 month stay in jail for child neglect, my mother permanently left my brother and I with my grandmother. I was 6 and my brother was 3. My grandmother is an abuser as well, and a violent alcoholic. She drunkenly beat the crap out of me growing up but never laid a finger on my brother. 

I was ostracized, he was showered in gifts. I wasn’t allowed to have a birthday, he had birthday parties. And so on. 

My mother lived with us for short time periods of 6 months or a couple weeks for a couple years. . Eventually it got to the point where she didn’t visit once for 5 years. 

During my entire childhood, my mother had full custody and made all executive decisions for my life and my brothers life. My grandmother had zero custody. For example, we were not allowed to have health insurance, as my mother does not believe in vaccines or healthcare. She had the final say on everything regardless of what state she lived in. 

Throughout this time period, my grandmother funded my mothers entire life. My grandmother paid for numerous apartments in multiple cities and states. At one point, my mother lived 30 minutes away from home and my brother and I had no clue where she was. 

My grandmother did make good money, but after paying for 1,000 dollars of red wine a month, 2 apartments, and my mothers entire lifestyle, we pretty much had nothing left. Throughout the 5 years that my mother was gone, we lived with electricity in only half the apartment. We sometimes didn’t have food. We never had heat, in a very cold part of california. 

When I was 13, my mother decided to move back to my home state (California). This was after the aforementioned 5 years of complete absence. My grandmother tricked her into believing she would be getting another furnished apartment, and told her at the airport that she would actually be coming home to live with her children, unless she had somewhere else to stay.  

The FIRST thing my mother did after not seeing her own children for 5 years… before taking her shoes off, removing her sunglasses, or simply fully entering the door, was tell me (at 13 years old) that she’d love to see me commit suicide. She then very warmly greeted my brother, and everyone bonded as a reunited family while I cried alone in another room. 

 Years later she admitted that this incident was due to her feelings about the apartment she was promised. 

There was already a golden child / scapegoat dynamic in the household. My mother just fueled the fire. My brother and I were NOT close at the time. He hated me and I hated him back. He was rewarded for treating me badly, etc. But I did take care of him in a way that a parent would in many instances. 

 From this day forward, my mother began what I like to call the “four year tantrum” about being tricked into living with her own children. She did not work, as my grandmother fully supported her financially. She dedicated her time to herself and her children in her own fucked up way. Her main goal was to change our lives to meet her standards, while continuing to live life as an overgrown child. She loved to walk around the apartment saying “I didn’t grow up poor like my kids,” laughing and smiling. Or another fun one “My mommy bought me braces! that’s why my teeth don’t look like yours!” 

She did get us electricity. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

I’d say her main hobby was physically fighting my grandmother. I would also say that it was unfortunately a fair fight between rage and drunken violence. 

Just a couple months after moving in she forcibly shaved my head and gave me traditionally male clothing to wear. On the other hand, she made sure my brother had a birthday party that cost thousands of dollars. A beautiful airbnb, activities, the whole 9 yards. This was paid for by my grandmother. 

I’m getting closer to the point, don’t worry … 

So, as time went on I would say her behavior only got worse. It got to the point where my mothers biggest hobby was to torture me. She had all day to do this due to lack of employment.  She did anything she could to destroy my high school education, bully me, and other strange behavior such as stealing my panties to sleep with a strange man. 

At this point, the behavior was so extreme that the childhood feud between my brother and I ended. He did not think the way I was being treated was fair anymore, and we became very close. I’d even say we were best friends. 

When I was 15, my mother began to attend therapy. She genuinely believed that she was the victim of everyone around her. A victim of my grandmother (in some ways, yes.) … A victim of her children. I’d also say her narcissistic traits were more grandiose at the time. She often bragged about abusing me to friends, and couldn’t understand why people walked away from her. 

After some time in therapy, my mother was diagnosed with NPD. 

I do not believe she fully accepted or understood her diagnosis at the time, because she then bragged about being a diagnosed narcissist to close friends and again, couldn’t understand why they walked away. 

The only person who seemed to stick by her side and support her behavior was the aforementioned strange man. My mother and her new boyfriend would actually bond about hating me! He supported her behavior, he told her she was in the right. 

2 years later, (i’m 17 at this point)  she moved out of the apartment with my brother(14 at the time) and went to start a new life with the strange man and her golden child.

Now, my mother had her moments but for the most part, she showed my brother nothing but love. In her own way, at least. But her decision making when it comes to his life has been nothing but detrimental. 

Shortly after the eighth grade, my mother pulled my brother out of school. She does not believe in k-12 education or college. Something about “brainwashing” and I don’t know what else. His high school education stopped just as quickly as it started.  She also destroyed his credit at this age. I’m not sure if it was for bills or shopping. I just know it happened. 

Soon after, she became pregnant by the strange man and they got married.

Ever since the first baby was born my brother (15 at the time)  has been a full time parent. 

During this time period, my mother “lost” all of my brothers identification. (social security card, birth certificate, etc.) 

One year later, my grandmother kicked me out and sold the apartment I grew up in. She then bought my mother a big house in the south. My mother then moved with her husband, new baby, and my brother to the deep south. And my grandmother came along, but chose her own apartment. My mother and her husband lived in the home for free, as neither of them worked, and my grandmother footed the bill. She then got pregnant again. 

My brother says that for 2 years after moving to the south, my mother and grandmother would automatically blame me for inconveniences such as a leaky dishwasher, or a whistling window. Even though I was on the other side of the country, all alone. 

The relationship between my mother and the strange man was tumultuous while it lasted. My mother would have days where she’d scream at the husband all day, saying she hated him … and the next day she’d say he’s the love of her life and she wants to have even more kids. The husband was quite frankly an asshole and a walking red flag for the entirety of their relationship. 

He’s been known to abuse former girlfriends, and my mother knew this information. She said it wouldn’t happen to her because she’s “not like those bitches.” repeatedly. I guess she was right, because although it was extremely toxic, he did not abuse her. 

My brother spent almost the entire time that he should’ve been in high school taking care of my youngest sister full time. Then came the new baby, and shortly after my mother and the strange man/ husband got into a huge fight, and he left permanently. 

My mother did start working when the youngest was about 2. 

So at this point  my brother has been raising kids full time from 15-20. And throughout this entire period, my mother has told my brother that she has big plans, and that if he waits everything will be okay and she’ll buy him nice things and pay for him to go to college. He believes her every single time, and nothing ever comes to fruition. 

Despite our upbringings my brother is a very understanding, smart, and empathetic person. He says he is making the sacrifice to raise these children because it’s what I did for him to the best of my ability. He has a couple options, and it is ultimately his choice to stay there. 

I know that my brother does not feel that he is being abused. I’ve talked to him about this. He’s not scared of my mother, she does not treat him the way she treated me. After all, he is still the golden child in her eyes. 

He actually says that he feels bad for ME, as I am completely financially independent and I don’t really have a family in the way that he does. 

Sometimes he functions as a flying monkey and repeats my mothers lies or insults to me. He can sometimes insist that my mother is telling the truth when that’s just not the case. And I hate debating about what the truth is. I know the truth. I remember it all. But I let it go and hope he’ll grow out of it. 

I know that the children are okay. I know that my mother is not physically violent anymore. My brother has told me that I “severely overestimate the amount of time she spends around the kids.”

Although i’ve been told my mother still loves to say “I didn’t grow up poor like my kids.”  


I can’t help but acknowledge that he has had no opportunity, no education, and at this point, he’s aged into adulthood with zero basic identification and a destroyed credit score.

He doesn’t know how to drive, he hasn’t had any opportunity to work, he doesn’t have a bank account … he’s just been stuck in the tornado that is my mothers life.  

He can’t just get a job because he’d be leaving two small children alone, and he has no identification in the first place. Along with that, he’s always living in some remote southern area, with towns as small as 300. He can’t simply get a job because it’d be a 45 minute drive to the nearest opportunity. 

Although it’s his choice to stay there, is it really even a choice ? 

My brother is turning 21 in just a couple weeks, and the children are now 3 and 5. I can’t believe my mother never did anything for her golden child. I genuinely thought she’d make at least some minor attempt at setting him up for success. But she truly did nothing. I feel that she destroyed his life in a very calculated manner. 

He actually doesn’t answer my calls anymore, but I still care. We didn’t get in a fight or anything, he just stopped answering. I guess i’m not ready to accept that the only family member I had is gone either. I still care. 

It all disappoints me so much and makes me so sad.

1o68ir3,My jealous sisters and enabling mom sabotaged my dream job and I lost everything. Advice Needed,"Hey guys, I’m feeling really shit and frustrated right now because of what my abusive sisters and my enabling mom did to me.

Earlier this year, I (23F) graduated from college and started my job at my dream company. It was extremely competitive to get into this company and industry. I spent an entire year working hard to secure that offer. It came with a high salary and was basically what every college student aspires to get.

But my sisters (both 22F), who are just a year younger than me and in the same field, became very jealous when they heard the news. They stayed quiet about it at first, but once I started my job, they began working together to sabotage it.

Every time I came home from work, they would start explosive fights, make threats, and try to intimidate or manipulate me. Some examples include:

* Threatening to go through my room while I was away at work
* Threatening to contact my company’s HR and send them videos of me arguing
* Threatening to beat me up when I left my room
* Deliberately blocking the bathroom or toilet when I needed to use it before or after work and smirking while doing it
* Constantly texting me about the bathroom being “unclean” even when I left it spotless, just to control me
* Starting explosive fights out of nowhere over shared things like the washing machine or house keys

These threats and fights would come out of nowhere, after work or on weekends, even when I tried my best to avoid them.

My mother did nothing to stop this. Instead, she supported my abusive sister, while my other sister would get excited during these fights, laughing, filming, and cheering her twin on in trying to sabotage me.

What made it worse was that I still had to live with them while I was looking for places to move out.

Because of the constant stress, I couldn’t perform well at my new job, especially during a crucial period when performance mattered most. Eventually, I was fired during probation for underperformance.

I regret not moving out before starting my job, but I truly didn’t know they would go this far to sabotage me, it had never happened before.

Right now, I feel extremely hopeless, frustrated, and stuck. I don’t know how to recover from this, and I’m still living with them because I can’t move out yet.

1o67irt,50 and figuring,"Here is a condensed story with a question (still longer than I would like):
I’m 50.
Until I was about 35 I thought that my type of upbringing was totally normal. I grew up in a house of infrequent physical abuse but regular verbal and psychological abuse. The problem was that I wasn’t performing in school and lied to hide my failures.
I went to college, moved far away, established a career, found love, married, and became a parent to 2 amazing kids.
Since I’ve had kids my parents really want my (our) time and attention. At first it was good. As I raised my kids, I realized how crazy my parents’ house was and that I would never do to my kids what my parents did to me. So I started to pull away.
When I have mentioned it, I have been told that I was too sensitive and that i have no idea how hard it was to be my parent (which I think is true).
But, pulling away (slightly) is right for me (again, age 50….so old), but also for my wife and kids.
I honestly feel so guilty for doing this to my parents now. I don’t think it’s fair to bring up an issue from 1991 (or 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, etc) and make that the basis for our relationship now.
Questions - are my gripes from 30 years ago fair? Could I just be exaggerating what happened in my head? Would love to hear the thoughts of anybody in a similar situation.

1o672h9,"My nmom is sick, can I still be no contact?","I have a difficult relationship with my nmother. When I was in late high school, she quit her job and her drinking became even worse. For the next 10 years our relationship disintegrated. She was constantly verbally cruel and manipulative. She once sent homophobic death threats to my best friend via texts, because she apparently thought that he was somehow using me. In reality, he was my only friend at the time.

When I moved out, every time I visited home she would get drunk and scream and fight and wake me up in the middle of the night to argue. Things only got worse from there and I cut contact for months. When I broke no contact, I was resigned to stepping back a lot from the relationship. But then everything weirdly got better when my grandad (her father) got sick and died of cancer.

She stopped drinking to look after him. She had her own health problems arising at the time (alcohol related liver disease) but she spent nearly a year looking after her Dad constantly. This is obviously an extremely difficult, important and traumatising experience for her. Despite her being so busy and exhausted, it was kind of nice to have my old mother back. After he passed, she stayed okay for a few months. I even took her on a trip as my way of saying thank you for everything she did.

Fast forward a few years, she is now back to drinking, back to lying and manipulating. She never apologises, never acknowledges where she has hurt someone and says such outrageous things to upset people.

If it wasn’t for her health conditions I would not want to speak to her again. She lies to Drs about her drinking, because she doesn’t want them to treat her ‘like a drunk or an addict’. She still brings up the death threats against my friend from years ago as an example of her being a good mother to me and me being ungrateful.

I don’t want her to be a part of my life in a big or small way. I’m at the same place now as I was when I cut contact several years ago. Whenever I block her I feel physically lighter and stronger in myself. Whenever I have contact with her and she gets in these moods I feel so angry and resentful and exhausted.

 

But at the end of the day she is my mother and I hate the idea of her dying alone in a hospital bed scared and sick. But these days she pushes everyone away from her. My dad looks after her with lifts and the shopping, housework etc but she gets so aggressive with him that he has no choice but to leave her alone in the house. I don’t have a car and I live two hours away, so there is very little I can actually do for her. I don’t want her to feel scared and alone when she is unwell. But she makes it impossible to have a relationship with her.

Would I be awful if I cut off contact?

1o66igl,their constant need for attention is so exhausting,"it’s like they have a sixth sense whenever i decide to cut back on contact or they notice i’m not over functioning the way i used to. i used to feel so much guilt for not wanting to talk to them weekly on the phone until i realized the reason i always felt so resentful after is bc it was a codependent trauma dump on their part where the only conversation about me is criticism in whatever thinly veiled or not kind of way/negging. i am so. fucking. tired. i have literally a trillion specialists from the health issues i’ve developed from being under such extreme stress from childhood on and feeling extreme guilt any time i rest or feel something remotely close to joy. i legitimately developed pots in high school from having to cohabitate. i’m almost 30 now and it literally takes me weeks to recover from a single conversation with them

as one of the most benign anecdotes of my mother: i had a sort of pre heart attack/cardiac event last year due to the combo of having a heart condition and being under so much stress and had to be treated by paramedics/saw my life flash before my eyes/etc. my mother only reached out nearly a week later to berate me for taking the ambulance bc of how expensive it is despite me being in literally no danger (or my parents) of financial trouble. lol

they know i am struggling and yet have the audacity to without fail act like i as a person and my very real problems do not actually exist. they always have to be the center of everything. always. even my fucking graduation from law school they were honestly so performative and reluctant to celebrate me like it was actually so fucking sad. they send a million texts a day and expect a response/constant commenting on their lives as if i’m not the one in need of a fucking parent/unemployed bc of said chronic stress/doing life alone etc. ahhhh this is such a rant but just really needed to get that off my chest esp now realizing why i have attracted certain kinds of friendships into my life that trigger my avoidance/emotional shutdown for the same reasons

1o66dsi,It's getting overwhelming and out of control,"

 I (18F) live in India. Growing up, I was taught that if I didn’t wear the hijab, I’d go to hell. I was also overweight and used to hide behind it. Over the past few years, I’ve lost weight, gained confidence, and started feeling more comfortable in my own skin.

Now that I’ve stopped wearing the hijab, my parents have completely turned on me. They say I’ve broken their trust and become “immodest.” They emotionally blackmail me and say if I remove it, I’m “dead” to them.

It’s gotten worse  they take my phone away at night, threaten to stop sending me to university, and recently said they’d get me married if I don’t “obey.” I’m legally an adult, but I still depend on them financially for education, so I feel stuck.

I’m scared, angry, and honestly starting to hate them. I want to build independence and leave eventually, but I don’t know how to start safely.

I need advice from anyone who’s gone through something similar how did you gain freedom in a controlling family without losing your education or safety? Also, how do I deal with the emotional toll of living like this every day?

1o6650l,Narcissist father trying to win over my 18 yr old (his granddaughter),"My dad is a narcissist and a well respected and well loved psychotherapist. Bizarre combo. He cheated on my mom for years with his psychology students. I even have a half brother from those times. My parents are still married, now for 40 years. 

I figured out that I wasn’t the problem at age 38. It was so freeing. But now that I set boundaries and I’m a disappointment, and he has set his his sights on my 18 year old daughter as the focus of his manipulation. He told me I shouldn’t visit her during her year abroad in Europe (we live in the US) because “she should be free to travel and hang out with friends” but then he said he was going to go visit her while she’s there, but not during her breaks. She has a specific 2 week break in April when I was going to visit her, and he decided to plan a trip to Morocco and offer her an all expenses paid trip to Morocco during her April break. 

He talks bad about me to her, he has for a while now. He always says to her that that I’m too emotional or anxious, often says “your mom is nuts” when I try to set boundaries. He tells people he raised her, which is insane. He always acts surprised when I know something about my daughter that he doesn’t. Or surprised when I say that she wanted to hang out with me. 

I have talked to her about it. She sees the manipulation sometimes but she’s also 18, she likes her ego being padded by him, she likes the “can do no wrong” pedestal he puts her on, and she likes the money he wants to give her in return for adoration. 

Especially difficult because I’m a single mom, had her at 22, her dad left and has never been in her life. So it was long hard work getting myself through college with a toddler and making a life for us. I worked really hard to make everything ok for us. I have given up my whole life this far for her to have a better chance than I did. I’m feeling heartbroken that my baby, my first true love, my now 18 yr old daughter is off in the world and her manipulative grandfather is wedging a greater divide between us. He never gave me any help. He wasn’t there for his actual daughter. I never got trips after being 18. Maybe if he had tried to be a real dad to me, I would have been more successful in my life.

No amount of achievements I do will ever get them to see me as equal. They are all about power and control and want to maintain in that superior sense of self over you. 

Whenever I talk to her like an adult, she will play games or act super immature. Whenever I try to set a mature boundary she will get offended. When she rages she loses control like a 5 year old having a tantrum (she even stomped her feet once like a legit tantrum). 

Just one rational, adult conversation with my mother is all I have wanted for all my life and I am coming to terms that I will never get it.

1o655n9,"Is this considered childhood trauma, even if my parents loved me?","I’ve been trying to understand myself better lately. I tend to overthink a lot, constantly worry what others think about me, and feel this need to make everyone like me. I often feel excluded even when I logically know it’s probably nothing. I’ve also started shutting people out emotionally because I’m tired of always needing validation.
I’ve been wondering if this might be connected to my childhood, but I’m unsure if it really “counts” as trauma.
My parents (typical strict Asian parents) used to hit or beat me when I got bad grades or didn’t meet expectations. They didn’t hit me for no reason  it was always about school or behavior. They also gave pep talks about how important education is and how they just want me to succeed. I know they love me, and they’ve supported me in many ways.
But still… my dad once told me I was a mistake and that he never wanted me this way. That comment stuck with me. Even though he apologized or made up for it later, I never really forgot it.
My mom also used to beat me up with dosa tawas( basically a big round utensil made of iron or steel) whenever marks were low
But this physical beating is pretty common in Indian households so now I don't know what to think of it
Whenever I get into a relationship now, I don't know why but I constantly need validation that I am being loved.
I often ask them what to they like in me and I question it more and more.
One of my exes cheated on me and then made me look like a bad guy and now I'm on the verge of cutting almost everyone out of my life
I am in college rn and I have a few friends but I feel soon I'm gonna cut them out or they will cut me out if I become this nuisance who overthinks and constantly worries abt minute details
So my question is:
Is this childhood trauma? Even though they loved me and meant well? 
Or am I overthinking and making it a bigger deal than it is?

i don't even know if this post made sense, I didn't know how to write it well and elaborate on my feelings, so I took help from chatgpt then added some more inputs

1o65563,My mom is a groomer,"Yeah the title pretty much says it. I (24f) learned that my mom started dating a guy younger than me when I was 21. My mom was 40f at the time when she started dating this guy. At first she told me he was 19, so 2 years younger than me, but it turns out he was actually 18. Right before she started dating him, she got fired from her job, which was odd.

She lied to me about the reason and it sounded off. Once I found out she was dating this boy, I felt in my gut that her being fired had to do with this guy. My mom used to work as a therapist at a juvenile detention center. My mom also helped me find a roommate which was one of her coworkers (24f), and she knew my mom’s boyfriend through the facility. 

I’ve suspected and asked my mom for years and she adamantly denies and lies over and over about it so I told her I want nothing to do with that relationship and don’t want to hear about it. She would constantly come to me with their relationship issues, and they were very abusive. I made it very clear that this relationship made me uncomfortable and that it was traumatic constantly hearing about their abuse when ai already suspect my mom groomed him. My mom was also very verbally abuse, manipulative, and narcissistic growing up so I already resented her. But this relationship made me resent her 10x worse. I felt helpless as a child and I felt bad for her boyfriend because I KNOW how my mom gets. 

Anyway, they aren’t together anymore because he became super abusive and she had to file charges against him. It is so hard because even though I feel bad that she endured so much with him, she was literally an abuser. I saw it myself, scratching him, throwing things at him while driving, etc. And there was one time they were fighting and driving and literally facetimed me. He showed me the scratches on the face and said “ You wanna know how I really met your mom? It was in the facility” and my mom was dead silent and was like “Really, you’re gonna believe him” later on. He texted me the next day saying that he was just saying that because he was mad at my mom. This relationship was just so traumatizing, all in all. When I expressed not wanting any parts, my mom would call me selfish and say i’m never there for her despite her always being there for me.

Fast forward to this weekend. She got demoted from another job and was ranting to me and blowing my phone up saying she needed me to show up for her. After this, she the, randomly, flipped the switch and said she was talking to her cousin and said that she mentioned meeting her ex in that facility. My mom accused me of telling her and said “she only told me” even though she’s only ever LIED about this situation. I’m just in shock- partly because I KNEW IN NY GUT SHE WAS GROOMING HIM. She just lied and lied and got angry every time I spoke about it. And she basically confirmed it yesterday. I told her I never talked to the cousin, because I didn’t, and she was just so adamant on me “not being loyal”.  Turns out, she told the cousin in a previous convo that the boyfriend was someone she met from work. Later when she confided in this cousin about the abuse, the cousin out two and two together. 

She said things like: “I don't care if I'm the biggest liar in the world, you should have been

Hands down no questions asked
That's loyalty”

“Just one nagging question for my self closure. Even if we went your theory and I'm having an affair in the facility. What would the Country be without your profession. Does that mean I deserved what happened to me.
And now that I know there is a whole new generation of attorneys who alread decide on their own if someone is guilty without having every single shred of evidence. As you know heresy can never be used in Court. Why? You can examine a witness who is not present. Wow, that our country is bad now. Give it ten years” (I’m a lawyer)

I replied: “You sent a lot but what I will say is that nobody has ever said that your abuse is justified- I do NOT believe it was justified.
If you did have an affair in the facility it would make you a groomer. But that does not mean you deserve what happened to you, and even if you did have an affair in the facility (which is did not say to anyone), I still wouldn't think your abuse was justified at all. I don't think (name) should have ever done the things he did”

she said: “just saw that..A fucking groomer.
Get the fuck out of here. The audacity....so now I truly know what you think and spread. You have been the only one whose continues to be judgmental. Even the ones you did tell, understand that is not the time to ask questions for their personal reasons. You have shown me that you don't value me, use me when it's convenient from you and now once again, I have to walk away to protect my own peace from someone who I would never expect to betray me
No therapist can repair this”

She also said therapy hasn’t helped me (she’s a therapist), started calling me names, said she wasted her life and to leave her the hell alone. 

I feel distraught, empty, and just so sad. Disappointed in my mother. Unsure of what to do. I blocked my mom because it was just too much. I truly don’t know how to move forward in our relationship. And she does pay my phone so I’m scared she’ll cut it off. I’ve never blocked her and i’m just very anxious, granted she doesn’t know where I live and it’s the only bill she covers.

My dad also had a mental health break down and literally cut me off by saying “you’re bad for my mental health” and then disappeared for years. No one knows where he is. And I know my mom was abusive to me and was a shitty mom but she was the only parent I had left.

1o652rz,Did I Ever Have a Mother? A Sister?,"I’m new to this page. Forgive me if this is a lot. Before June I had never considered that my mother was a  narcissist. Now, I look back on a life of being terrorized by my own emotions; of bizarrely profound loneliness; self harm; crippling anxiety and depression; intimacy issues and unexplainable health problems ---- how did I not realize that it could all be explained by the only constant of my life, a mother who enjoys hurting. 

She’s a therapist, and encouraged me to take care of my mental health. My brother is disabled and my sister is a weirdo who happens to be pretty. The house was so loud. My sister was/is prone to physical outbursts and incomprehensible selfishness. She hurt/hurts me a lot and my mom would/does intervene, but in a way that felt more like another kid jumping in. People would encourage each other to confide only to humiliate you later with that same information. I learned to anticipate and manage interactions, sort of. Christmases were terrible. My sister would have a tantrum and my mom would provoke her with a comment that really did seem innocuous, thinking back. Also the only funny people I knew, once. The three of us went to concerts and museums and those memories feel only good. I didn’t connect well with other kids.

My mother.. It feels like I pulled back a curtain and saw who the real villain was. Like I finally turned on a lightbulb and yes now I can finally see what sort of mess it is and it’s horrifying; almost obliterating to my ego, whatever that was. My mother has never demonstrated a capacity to make me feel protected, cherished, or unconditionally loved. She ruined my sister and is the reason my dad is working himself to death in a different town. She took my request that she please stop inviting over the handyman who sexually harassed me from 14-19 as a personal insult; over the next ten years she went out of her way to employ or mention him in conversation. In June, after a week of comforting her over the death of my grandma. The disturbingly innocent confusion in her eyes. There was something wrong with reality. I had known this abstractly. 

I went no contact and began giving up on my sister. Mostly stopped drinking. Funnily enough I’m a journalist, as if some part of me was always hungry for an honest conversation. But I spiral a lot: am I narcissist, too? Am I remembering wrong or being dramatic? Have I ever loved? Was I ever loved, but also who could ever tell me? If I beat this will I finally feel like an adult, and not like I’m both too young and old?

1o6510l,My mom wants to have secrets from me with my not even existing yet kids,"Now that I start analysing my mother more careful I see that she has a lot of covert narcissist traits. Once I was talking to her about what parental strategy I plan to organise for my future kids (I don't even have a wife or a girlfriend yet, but I was thinking about parenting since I was a child myself). She started picturing this future in her head and told me something like ""I will be such a good grandmother. I will love them \[grandchildren\] and I will have little secrets with them :)"". It sounded weird to me. They don't even exist, but one of your first thoughts is secrets hidden from me. I said that it sounds weird. She told me that it's important for her to have connections with my future kids because if they will not be able to be understood by me they will be able to talk to her. I thought ""What theee...? I'm listening to a person who ruined our connection over me droping out of the university? I was hiding my hobbies from her for years so she can't hurt me. I need to argue with her over any major descision in my life and I always hear ""I'm more experienced, I know better. You don't know"". And now she says that she will be a compasionate person when I, for some reason, will not be?""

1o64a3t,I just realized why my mom married my dad.,"My dad is a narcissist and my mom is very abusive towards me and I thought she is an enabler but she probably is a narcissist too.

Both my parents abuse me and enable each other.

I always wondered why my mom married my dad. It just did not make any sense. I remember asking my older brother this question when I was a child.

I just didn't get it. I can't imagine being like ""I don't love you, I don't want my children to be like you, you are so stupid, I hate talking to you, I hate everything you do, you are lazy, you can't do anything right, you are disgusting and an addict but yes I will marry you if you do anything I say like a slave."" Wtf? But that is what she did.

I repeatedly asked my mom why she married him. She said that he was so nice to her before she married him.

But she also always said very weird things about what she thought about him while she was dating him and when she married him:

\- She thought he was so stupid and she hated every time he opened his mouth. She told him all the time that he is so stupid before they married and she claims he always agreed and told her that he is so stupid and deserves to be hit for it and that she is so smart and that he wants to learn from her.

\- He was addicted to several things like gambling and smoking and she made him quit. She is very proud of it and told me all my childhood how she pulled ""this man who was dumber than shit out of the ghetto"" (Sorry her words, not mine.).

She constantly said how he was so stupid he could not even do the simplest things and that she had to spend years to teach him how to be less stupid and that he is still so stupid but less stupid than he used to be thanks to her.

And that she should left him were he was because he is not grateful. That everything he has and can do he only has because of her. That he would be nothing without her.

\- He followed her around for a few years and she repeatedly told him that she doesn't love him and he told her that she will love him once they are married. So she married him. Wtf?

\- She told him before she married him that she doesn't want her children to be like him. She claims he promised her that he will do anything she says and he will do only what she says and that he wants to be their future children just like her and not like him and that their children will also do only what she says.

\- She demanded that he doesn't have an opinion and will learn to think exactly like her and he agreed. When I was born she demanded the same from me.

\- She agreed to marry him IF he doesn't have free will, no opinion that is different from hers, if he will do everything she says without talking back, if their children will only listen to her and not to him.

\- She married him because she ""never met a man who was so humble"". Now I realize she actually meant ""I never met a man who is so below me, who makes me feel so superior and so much better than him, whom I can fully control, who agrees to not have an opinion of his own, who does everything I say like a slave and doesn't talk back. If I marry him I will be the queen in this house and my husband and children will be my puppets without free will.""

I could write more but this is already too long.

I realized that all these things are what a narcissist wants in their partner. Or am I wrong. Please tell me if I'm wrong.

I realized that she probably married him so she could feel like she is the best and smartest and he is the dumbest who can't do anything and needs her to survive.

All my life she told me how stupid and useless he is and how he lied to her because after they married and I was born he started to do what HE wanted and did not do everything she says like he promised.

All my life she told me how he only got a job because she got him a job, how he only quit gambling because she made him quit, how he was too stupid for everything and she taught him everything with endless patience because she is just such a good person, how he was too stupid to even string a sentence together when they met and she taught him how to speak and think, how he has no taste and dressed badly and he has to be so grateful that she made him dress like she wanted it because that is the only right way to dress of course.

You might feel sorry for my ndad now. Please don't. He is the same as her and he only acted how she wanted him to act so she will marry him. He intended to make her submissive after making her dependent on him. He beat her up, he strangled her. He abused ME to the point I almost died. He is just as bad as her.

My parents have this weird dynamic where my dad will beat my mom up and strangle her because she doesn't let him do what he wants and then he will still do what she wants. Sometimes he will do what he wants secrectly. When she finds out she freaks out and shouts at him, then he beats her and then he does what she says.

I think my parents are two narcissists who found each other. And each one of them was planning to make the other a victim without rights. The deserve each other.

1o63s5c,Family is toxic,"I F29 am living with my mother and younger brother until I can afford to move out . My mom has always been emotionally and verbally abusive. She constantly yells, gets in my face, imitates me, threatens to hit me, and never takes accountability for anything. Every argument ends with her screaming that everything is my fault, even when I calmly try to explain my side. She only ever takes my brother’s side no matter what he does.

She’s extremely sexist and still treats me like a child — watches me when I get ready, comments on where I’m going, and expects me to act like a servant in the house because I’m a woman. She uses religion and guilt to control me and justifies my brother’s laziness and disrespect while blaming me for “not being a good daughter.”

My younger brother constantly starts things on purpose — invades my space, tries to sit in the room I sleep in just to get a reaction, takes over anything I try to have for myself, and then plays victim when I react. He’s manipulative and loves control. My mom always enables him and attacks me instead, saying I’m “evil” or “inhumane” for standing up for myself. Apparently “mother” is upset because of me Lol she’s the one causing all this chaos and she’s the victim?

I work, pay for most things in the house, and they still ask me for money constantly — even for his laundry. If I refuse, my mom loses it and starts verbally abusing me again. It feels like they both see me as a tool, not a person.

Whenever I try to stay calm, she’ll purposely bring up old fights or say cruel things to trigger me. She never tries to understand my side — she just wants to win, to prove me wrong, or to make me look like the problem.

1o63aeo,is my mom a narcissist?,"my sister passed away in july.. and ever since my mom has INSISTED we get rid of everything. she made us clean out her room a month after her passing (literally getting rid of everything) she demanded we remove her pictures and delete everything of her. we told her everyone grieves differently and just because she doesn’t want to see pictures of her or anything of her doesn’t mean we don’t want to. she demands we don’t have anything to do with her either.. she has mental breakdowns (throws dishes, screams) when she saw my dad had a tiny picture of her in his drawer to remember her, she said he shouldn’t keep anything of hers to respect her because she “feels the pain of losing her more” than anyone in this house. 
i tried talking with her and said we want to keep her memory alive but she then throws in our face how we don’t care about her or how we don’t do anything to respect her by talking about my sister. i told her we all are feeling pain and are suffering but our method of coping is keeping her memory alive. again she raged when i told her this and said we need to stop keeping pictures of her and get rid of everything.

1o62mz1,The Valley and The Cliff: Growing up with my narcissistic mother,"Hi everyone, I’m new here. I’ve been reading this community for a while, and it’s helped me feel less alone. I haven’t shared much before, but this poem is my attempt to process some of the pain, frustration, and inner growth that came from growing up with a mother who was often emotionally unavailable, hurtful, and overwhelming.

This is specifically about my mother. My father rarely factors into my reflections because he has always been largely indifferent, focused on his own lowly distractions, and oblivious to my struggles (lifelong undiagnosed trigeminal neuralgia, severe sleep apnea, and emotional upheavals of growing up and youth).

I want to add that my restraint and patience in dealing with her comes not just from natural tenderness, but also from my dharmic reverence for the concept of motherhood, even though my mother herself may never qualify for the full measure of divine love and respect a son can hold.

Despite her constant mockery, I know that my inner life has been vast and unshakeable — a life of intense introspection, devotion, and spiritual discovery. I have navigated both tumultuous grief and ecstatic serenity, touched the unknowable through states like mahabhava samadhi, and cultivated a deep bhakti akin to sages like Sri Ramakrishna and Meera. Her attempts to see me as a “dead dimwit” miss entirely the depths I have quietly traversed.

I hope it resonates with someone here, or at least sparks reflection.

The Valley and the Cliff

He spoke only silence, hoping it could reach her.

She had sealed herself,
her mouth filled with stones,
her echoes feeding on their own hunger,
drunk on noise she mistook for life.

He called out once.
The air returned only her own voice,
twisted upon itself, accusing the sky.

He stopped calling.
Not from pride,
but because no ear remained within her.
A closed heart cannot drink the rain;
a sealed pot cannot taste grace.

He stands now where sound ends,
on the cliff above the raging valley.
Even the gods pause in wonder:
how survives one who has been struck
so long by unending storm?

He does not call it strength.
He calls it discipline —
the quiet refusal to bleed where no one watches.

Below, the valley hurls its stones,
words that crack and crumble before reaching him.
He watches, unmoved.
Not in cruelty,
but in knowing that sound cannot scale silence.

Sometimes compassion rises like a tide,
touching his chest, then breaking.
He has learned: healing elixir cannot be poured
into a vessel that will not receive.

Now there is only space —
the wind between cliff and valley.
No names are remembered.
No bloodline binds.
No duty clings.

The wind moves freely,
bearing both love and ruin,
curse and absolution.

He sits beside it,
no longer waiting for understanding.
Freedom is not leaving;
it is ceasing to echo.

The valley still roars.
The cliff still stands.
And in the silence that follows,
her own voice returns —
empty, weightless,
her final mirror, she is still blind to see.

1o6209w,My Mom Should’ve Divorced  My Alcoholic Father,"Firstly, I’m 21F have grown up with my dad being an alcoholic. When I was younger, I was not aware of how much he drank, or the times he picked me up from school drunk. In high school, his drinking got worse and he would hide it from my mom and I. For example, he would empty liter tall plastic water bottles, then he would fill them with vodka and keep it in the front seat of his car. My home life has always been rough, I don’t remember if my dad has ever been physically abusive to my mom, but they have had yelling matches regularly. 

When I finished high school, I went to university overseas. My parents also ended up moving abroad as-well to another country 8,000 miles away from me because of my dad’s job. Now my parents are in credit card debt and my dad’s drinking has gotten to the point where I worry about my mom’s well-being. Before I left for university, my mom use to police my dad’s alcohol drinking habits and push him to do AA. However, since moving out, my mom’s said she’s “given up” trying to stop my dad. 

Recently, it’s gotten pretty bad and my dad is regularly verbally abusing my mom.  I want to help my mom, but we’re both dependent on my dad financially. Additionally, I’m the ONLY person she’s told about this. I’m worried because she is living abroad and doesn’t know many people there. Additionally, her family is overseas.

My friends are all either boring as hell with 0 personality or total narcs themselves who I end up cutting off

Because of all this trauma, I've never had a relationship that ends up working out. Just flings and hookups

It's hard for me to hold onto a job despite being ""good"" at most jobs I end up at. I usually get promoted or am a top performer by end up leaving because it's like I can't handle success or progress

It's also hard for me to accumulate or hold onto assets because of my trauma. It's like I'm afraid of success. So I don't have anything saved, an old beat up car, I rent an apartment. Even having this level of ""success' (not being homeless, and having an old car) seems hard to sustain

1o61lh3,Stuck living with and around nMom and enabling family members,"Sorry if my post breaks any community guidelines, this is quite literally my first and only post I’ve ever made on Reddit (created a burner account because I’m paranoid this could come back to me some day). Also, since this is labeled as an Advice Request post, any advice would certainly be more helpful than the blind stumbling I’ve been trying to work with.


To start with, I’m currently 24, unemployed, diagnosed with cptsd, double depression, and generalized anxiety disorder. I also have strong reasons to suspect I have moderate to severe OCD.

Without divulging into too many ‘unnecessary’ (for this post) details, I’m currently stuck in a situation of being unable to hold a job because nMom does everything she can to make life more difficult. 
With my very first job ever (starting at 18), she continuously harassed me into taking “less hours” (I was only part time, but my supervisors allowed me to take online classes when I wasn’t on the clock) until Covid hit, and I ended up having to quit said job.
At my second job (starting at 22), it was much farther away and came with many challenges, which ultimately resulted in me needing to quit when she only allowed me to get about 1-3 hours of sleep every night.

Now I’m stuck unable to get a job partially because nobody’s hiring (or at least, they aren’t hiring me) despite having “now hiring” signs everywhere, and partially because any time I try to get a job, she goes out of her way to ensure that it won’t last for very long. My only source of income is the occasional house sitting I try to do, but it isn’t much and there’s many more months between jobs than there are days I “work”.

Most of my life has been comprised of my mother doing similar and worse things. My father is an enabler who would rather give her what she wants at the cost of his children (my older sister and I) than to put his foot down and do literally anything about it. Trying to talk to my (maternal) grandparents only results in the usual “well when you have kids, you know not to be like them” talk, or the typical “well, that’s just how your mother is. What can you do about it?” response. I never had the chance to meet my paternal grandfather, and my paternal grandmother is no longer on this Earth, and was not someone I wanted to associate with anyhow.

Additionally, my older sister has also become an enabler and an ‘unintentional’ shit stirrer, despite everything. More often than not, I end up getting yelled at and punished for her messes and mistakes, and no amount of confrontation does anything to improve the situation. Just more complaints about how unreasonable our parents are and how she never gets to rest.
(Additional information: She works an incredibly laborious job that she has to wake up incredibly early for, but that doesn’t mean she can’t put her dirty dishes in the sink or throw out her own trash instead of leaving me to deal with it, which I often don’t have the chance to even do before mom sees it)

The thing I struggle with the most is the incredible burnout and extreme isolation I’m forced to endure because— despite being 24– I am not allowed the freedoms of even leaving my driveway for a walk down the street. It’s also incredibly hard for me to acquire helpful resources in my area, and the cost of living is too expensive to live on my own even if I were to get 2 jobs.

I’m very afraid that I’ll be stuck here forever. Since I’ve started making the true effort to improve my mental health and poor financial responsibility, I’ve only become more and more aware of how far I’ve been dragged into this hole of forced dependency. Every effort I make to become a little more independent is met with some form of “you can’t do that, you need to wait for someone else” or “you’re too stupid/useless anyway, so don’t worry about it.”
The way that kind of stuff has destroyed my personal confidence in my ability to do literally anything and my self esteem is a different story.

Sorry for the long post, but I’m not sure how to TL;DR it.

1o61jm6,Just need to let out frustration,"I see so many people that grew up in homes with narcissistic parents, emotionally and physically abusive parents, end even absent parents, who responded to their situation so different from me. And I just wish so deeply that I could have responded differently. And that I was confident enough to respond differently now. Some people have grown up to not let others speak over them, to be bold, to portray confidence in themselves, their wants, and their needs. Sometimes they even tell stories of responding to their parents as children with rebelling, fighting, trying to stand their ground. But me? Nope. I was scared shitless to disappoint my Nmom, even though thats all I did. I was terrified to step outside of the boundaries set for me. And even as an adult I act with her opinion in mind. I spent most of my young 20's trying to confirm with my friends if they could tag me in pictures and posts. Tried to be sure that into the mold made for me. And pushing against her wasn't something I even considered until about 27. Even still I think through choices with a ""what will she say/think"" though now i am more willing to push against that. I just wish I would have pushed back more so that I could feel more confident now. Im sick of feeling like im being thrown back into my child self the moment conflict arises. I want more than anything to feel free of that feeling, but being free of it sounds scarier than I can put into words. And im feeling all of this in a time where she and I are in the best place we've ever been, and she claims she wants me to be honest with her about the ways she's hurt me, but im so scared to vocalize anything to her. And im scared because she conditioned me to be. And I took the conditioning without so much as questions it for years.

1o61j8w,My Grandma’s Bracelet,"I’ll just jump straight into it. My mom is not a diagnosed narcissist but multiple people close to her suspect she is. Earlier this year, my mom gifted me my grandmother’s bracelet (her mother, deceased) and it was a very big deal. I cherished the bracelet but at some point, I misplaced it in the house. I was living with my mom at the time so my husband and I could get on our feet (we just moved back to my hometown). One day, I realized I had not seen the bracelet in a while and tore my part of the house apart. I could not have looked any more than I did. In particular, I checked the shared kitchen because I often take off jewelry to wash dishes or cook. I was devastated and couldn’t understand what happened to it. I cried often about this and spent 3 months on and off looking for it. I never admitted it to my mom out of fear and hoped it wouldn’t come up.

Eventually I became suspicious that my mom took the bracelet and hid it in her room. For context, in high school my mom gave me a ring (not a family heirloom this time) and again, I loved it. It was on my side table and apparently I knocked it on the ground in my sleep. I didn’t notice it at the time and my mom saw it on the floor, snatched it and hid it in her room. I spent a week that time searching for it and very upset. I didn’t admit it that time either or ask for help finding it knowing I would get in trouble. After a week, my mom asked why I wasn’t wearing the ring and I felt like a deer in the headlights. After making me squirm trying to think of what to say, she admitted that she hid it from me because “I obviously don’t care about the things she buys for me”. Something along those lines. My take at the time was that she wanted to punish me and prove some kind of point? So this time, I couldn’t help but wonder if she hid the bracelet from me and after many months, I caved and searched her bedroom. I tried not to violate her privacy as best I could and only look in places that were obviously for jewelry (jewelry armoire, ring dish etc.) but I didn’t find it. I felt guilty after but felt somewhat justified based on past experiences.

Fast forward to this week, we are no longer living with my mom and my entire immediate family went out for my mom’s birthday and for the majority of the day, we all had a great time. Towards the end of the visit (we were literally about to part ways in about 10 min), my mom suddenly turns to me and says “so have you worn my mother’s bracelet lately?” I immediately started to feel extremely unnerved and of course, I admitted no I had not worn it in some months. I felt put on the spot and sort of embarrassed as all eyes were on me at the table. She then said, “well do you even know where it is?” And again, I admitted no. You could hear a pin drop at the table and everyone looked uncomfortable. She then started laughing and telling the story of how she found it in the kitchen at her house tucked into the lid of a mason jar and how lucky it was that it jingled when she went to throw the lid away. I was extremely relieved she found it but then I immediately became suspicious that she hid it from me since both my husband and I searched the exact spot she found it dozens of times. I also can’t imagine myself putting the bracelet in a mason jar lid but humans do random things sometimes. When I asked how long ago she found it, she had a odd expression on her face and paused before saying it was two weeks ago. She said she meant to give it back to me but forgot. I told her to just keep it because I don’t want to go through this stress ever again. At this point, everyone was chuckling and trying to make light of the situation but a few comments were made from others about how my mom was “trying to get me” or interrogate me. I managed to smooth things over and we left on a decent note but I felt really weird and unsettled once I got home.

I guess I’m not sure why I’m posting. Does anyone have experience with something similar to this? What did you do? Do I take the bracelet back (she wants me to take it but I feel very unsure)? Is my mom showing narcissistic tendencies here?",grumpylilmushroom,1760403000.0,2,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o61j8w/my_grandmas_bracelet/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o61j8w/my_grandmas_bracelet/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o61j8a,I think my mom sexually assaulted me,"
So when I was 8-9 I was really young I just want to say that I don’t remember much, to be honest I don’t know if it really happened, a couple of years ago (6th or 5th grade) I started touching myself and fingering myslef, and just shoving whatever up there, bubble sticks, the plastic thingy that holds tampons, and I’d watch porn, and I think over time i developed hypersexuailtiy either way, I told my mom that that cat itches and she laid me down on the bed and took my pants off and underwear, she didn’t ask me for permission she just did it and started touching it. And she kept asking me “how does that feel?” “Does it burn?” And I’d answer of course. I also remember my dad checking in,I’m not sure if he did anything though.  And I don’t remember much of that…I definitely felt weird if that’s what you wondering. I keep telling myself that I just blocked out me saying yes or my mom asking me if she wanted her to look at it but every time I think back I don’t remember it. I’d also tell my slef I gave permission by telling her what was wrong on down there, learning about SA and rape now I can’t help but think that it was, that’s what happened SA but I wanted to ask Reddit if this counted.

Edit: I don’t remember her if she ment it to be sexual but she was definitely touching it, and yes my dad was watching and next to my mom. And now that I’m older she always has been talking about my looks, boobs acne legs, body hair, a lot of things.",Prestigious-Drop6494,1760402999.0,43,0.82,38,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o61j8a/i_think_my_mom_sexually_assaulted_me/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o61j8a/i_think_my_mom_sexually_assaulted_me/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False

1o60v71,I finally went no contact with them.,"I'm sorry if this seems so scrambled and confusing, I'm a bit of a mess with all of this going on. I'm pretty much getting years of stuff off my chest.

Before my husband and I got married, he moved in with my parents and I in 2022. I was 23 at the time. Things have always been rocky between my parents and I, but I didn't know the extent of it until my husband came into the picture. (Super grateful for him!)

My husband and I got married in 2024 and moved out of my parents' house after a really rough few years of constant fighting with my parents. My own mom made my wedding planning all about herself. She refused to talk to my MIL and work together with her on anything. She eventually blew up at me when I told her I'd rather my MIL take over planning instead. She actually broke down crying. My dad has always been on her side, so it wasn't a surprise when he started getting angry too.

I got tired of years of fighting- threats from my dad to kick me out followed by ""I didn't mean it, I was just trying to make a point"" and constant ganging up on me from both parents over the smallest things. Moving out was the best thing I ever did. I always thought something was off, but the severity of it didn't hit me until my husband started talking about every messed up thing he saw my parents do. He told me my mother would apologize to him for me being a selfish person, she would tell him to try and make me act different, she would accuse me of stressing out my terminally ill father and shortening his life, etc... and it all rubbed him very wrong. Earlier this year, I got in a massive fight with both of my parents over something they promised to help us with and then backed out on. We both saw it- my parents both gaslighting us. ""We never said we would do that"" and ""you're acting ungrateful and entitled."" I stopped talking to my parents for a couple of days. My husband comes home from work and shows me a multi-paragraph text message from my dad saying I'm not in my right mind and basically telling him to get me under control. That was sort of the final nail in the coffin.
I tried SO HARD to make it work with my parents- calling, texting, trying to come visit, trying to plan lunch, etc... but nope! I was always the one calling and texting- usually no texts back and the calls were cut short by my mom. I couldn't visit because my dad wasn't feeling well enough for company. My mom couldn't come visit because I live ""too far away."" She's got no problem visiting other family way further away, but I digress. My mom only calls when she needs something- me to watch her house while she's out of town. My help with her after she's had surgery.

Maybe I'm an ass for this, but something in me snapped. I started saying no, I stopped answering texts right away, I started giving her the same excuses she would regularly give me. Maybe she would get the message. Nope! I eventually stopped trying to converse with her, except for one message asking her about tailoring a shirt.

She shot me a long lengthy text last week. She started the text off with a passive aggressive ""Oh hi mom, how are you and dad?"" She follows it with a bunch of accusations of me being selfish, inconsiderate, ungrateful, etc... but she's worded it in such a backhanded way. It sounds like she's trying to be really sweet and loving, but it's got really condescending and accusatory undertones. She's texted me a few other times since then, acting like nothing is wrong. No apology, though. 

It has been over a week now since I've responded or said anything to her. It's fucking scary. I've felt like I've needed her my whole life, but she never really seemed like she wanted to be there for me. I felt like a burden to both of my parents my entire life. Now, I feel like I don't need her anymore. 

Part of me feels satisfied because I'm showing her that I won't stand for this stuff anymore. The other part of me feels like I'm making a mistake. I don't know how long I'll be NC, but I feel like I need to do this for now so I can clear my head and stop letting them manipulate me. It used to be a cycle of gaslighting until it genuinely started affecting my memory. The stress of everything has made my chronic illness flare up and it has made my mental health the worst it has been since I was a teenager. I figured it was time to do something, and my therapist told me maybe some distance would help.

1o60kk0,Am I weird for being uncomfortable?,"For context I had to move back home due to health issues, I knew I shouldn't listen to my parents because time and time again they fearmonger and lie to me about very easy to dispute information, and they're emotionally abusive but I thought with a year apart they would be better this time and now I'm stuck here until I find a job I can actually do long term and it's a whole fucking thing and I'm frustrated living here lol

So I was already annoyed coming upstairs to hang out with them today, mostly because like I texted her asking if she wanted to hang out (if I don't hang out with her semi regularly she just walks into my room unannounced and I'm uncomfortable with that so) and she just never responded to the text, despite reading it, going on four hours. I had to ask her a second time and then she just said yes and I was like it's fine it's whatever. Then I got upstairs and one of the first things she asked me was ""how's your stay at the (last name) inn?"" To which I said it's not really an inn and she was like it basically is everything here is free (mind you she stressed that I should come home, she invited me to stay long term so why is she acting like me staying so long is like a burden) and I'm just like I'm unsure how to feel? Like on the one hand based on all the abusive behavior they've exhibited just this week alone, nevermind the last 24 years, I feel it's justified bc they constantly make little remarks that are just out of pocket and so incredibly rude? They definitely view our relationship as transactional and the second I say I'm not sure I can physically do that because I have a medical condition, they threaten to kick me out and leave me on the streets, which I feel is not normal at all. Idk I just hate all the little jokes that I can't tell if they're jokes/they come off really fucked up and awful because I'm autistic and I can't tell if they're joking most of the time.

I just feel weird for making such a big deal about such a small remark but on the other hand it's like small remark building on small remark for 20+ years so maybe I'm not being weird? Idk I just don't like how they act like they're holding shit over me because I'm chronically ill and can't do a lot by myself? And its frustrating

My sister told me, “I should have been the pretty one,” “mom never called me pretty.” So that was when I was an adult she told me maybe it was all envy for her behavior. I always felt like something was extremely wrong with me. I was getting abused by my boyfriend in HS and my math teacher calls me mom said I was the only one who didn’t hear the homework. So she gets me diagnosed with adhd. Then I think see I am different. I told my dad what my sister does to me and he goes yeah I don’t know why you two could never get along. Then he says by the way your sister called you selfish. So my mom is a ESFJ personality type which means she’s very warm and kind. She will spend thousands on Christmas for every kid in the family. She is the biggest people please enabler I know. So I appreciate that aspect about her. However as a kid she kept the home spotless, made me cry when I gained weight and body shamed me, held me to high perfectionistic standards, and does not care about any issues I’ve had with any family members to do this family parties. I even had a cousin kick my dog multiple times. I said please don’t kick my dog the other cousin comes over to shame me. She blamed me. My sister always used this against me and hid the abuse, but really pushed it calling me the B word in front of everyone. Nobody did anything. So now Halloween is coming up and she asks me if my sister and her kids and bf can come over. I immediately said no. When I’ve already explained in novel long texts and in person why I’m going no contact with her. Then she literally quotes scripture about forgiveness to me. I said yeah you’re not gonna guilt me with scripture. Then she said I am punishing the entire family when I know my dad could literally care less and never texts or calls me. So she says what about thanksgiving and Christmas you’re punishing the kids. I just know she’s not gonna stop because this is all she cares about. I literally prepared and expected this. My sister has not apologized to me and when I finally lashed out she did and then goes back to being a passive aggressive demon who would even get her friends and boyfriends in my 30’s to do these bully tactics against me at family dinners. So I sent my mom this video. I have dealt with OCD issues my whole life and I’m really sick and tired of feeling toxic guilt and being guilted by others.

1o5zmax,How to evict narcissist parent?,"I'm just going to go for it. I apologize, I don't know a thing about legal stuff. I was the sheltered child at home I'm still learning how to adult at 24.

My mother(61 or 62idek anymore) lives in my brother's (29) house that he owns with his wife. I live there as well.

My brother had guardianship(?) over my mother at one point so he could cover her medical needs. She's gotten so sickening to deal with to the point he removed himself from guardianship over her. 

We're all tired, we want her gone. My brother says court fees are expensive and my mom is a siren for making a scene so if we end up in that hole, there's no telling if we'd even win the case considering he used to be in charge of caring for her, which would be used against him.

We tried to convince our sister (a carbon copy of my mom) to take her but she's so irresponsible with her money it doesn't seem like it's going anywhere and her marriage is on the brink of end, her husband constantly talks about narcissistic abuse and.. yeah that's a thing.


What are your thoughts? I'm looking stuff up and I'm just stuck. I'll take any advice, resources, and I'd love to hear any similar experiences.

Thank you for your time.

1o5yxji,I feel like telling my family that I feel like a lot of them don't care,"A lot of the time I feel like I don't exist to them. On one end I'm glad that they don't really talk to me. On the other I feel guilt, shame, and anxiety that I don't talk to them. Some of my family have gone from being flying monkeys to narcissistic. Especially after my grandmother (on my dad's side) passed. I avoid talking to a few of my uncles on a phone call because they're very mean. The conversation just seems to serve as a way to make them feel good about themselves. To make them feel good that they're doing better than me. It's hard to explain but it just feels very cold, calculating, unsupportive, and analytical. It feels a lot like I'm being interrogated by someone. I'm just afraid if I say that I feel like my family doesn't like me or doesn't care that those few uncles will manipulate and turn it around on me. You may say well what about your other family? The problem is that the other uncles/aunts tend to bend or agree. They don't stand up to them. 

Let me list some things that some of them have done. 
Whenever I try to have a real discussion with Uncle E he shuts me down. 
Uncle E gets mad at me for ""talking too much"" in the car. 
Uncle D told me as a teenager that he can read me like a comic book. 
Uncle D brags about his time in the military and how he was trained in psychological warfare. 
Uncle D told me he can ban me from public places such as benches. That way I couldn't run away from my N grandmother. 
Both Uncle E and Uncle D have severe anger issues. 
The last time I talked to Uncle D on the phone he called because I missed a call from my dad's nursing home. He went on to basically interrogate me about my life and what I was doing. I felt like absolute shit after I talked to him. I felt a lot of stress, depression, and anxiety. He got mad at me for asking him to repeat a question. 

There's this sort of weird family dynamic. I don't know how to describe it. Just people tend to try to uphold this image or perception of them in the family. Kind of like ""oh look at us. Everything is great! See we're a happy family."" While underneath I can just see this dysfunction. No one really has the time or emotional bandwidth to talk about anything difficult or address issues. Whenever I try to bring up anything people seem to roll their eyes. They brush it aside and leave me on read. They also don't like it when I try to be silly with them. They feel as if I am taking away the spotlight when I'm just trying to engage and participate.

I feel emotionally neglected by a lot of them. I don't get any validation from them really. I don't get a congratulations for something or ""hey I'm so proud of you."" Just a ""Yeah?! and... Keep going. Keep trying harder."" It leaves me feeling pretty shitty to be honest. 

The only people who really care are the people on my mom's side of the family and like one uncle on my dad's side. I try to send a text on a birthday or holiday even to the ones I don't like. Other than that I don't say anything.

1o5yq2i,Nmum does not respect my parenting boundaries,"I struggle going back and forth on whether to go NC with my nmum. She has no other family besides myself and upon some reflection and internal growth I’ve learnt to pick up on a few things she does and how it has affected me as the person I am today. 

One of them being not respecting my boundaries or quite frankly listening to what I want or expect. It has now started to annoy me when it comes to my parenting. She has my daughter once a week for the entire day. I mainly have an issue (amongst others) on how, if my daughter is sick, she won’t just let her relax at her house. She always has to be doing something , whether it is taking her to her activities (eg swimming and gymnastics) or to the beach even when I’ve stated I do not want my daughter exerting herself as I want her to get better. Another example is telling me my daughter is fit to go to daycare when she is in fact sick, then hassling me and texting me she should be going etc. This morning she also commented that I am exaggerating my daughter’s sickness and going overboard with wanting her to rest. 

I realise she used to do this with me- I was never allowed a day off school or to recover at home as it would “interfere” with her schedule or routine. I realise she also has an issue with rules and loves to push them or flat out ignore them (as has happened many times with various scenarios sometimes involving security/authority although this is usually mixed with alcohol) 

Does anyone else experience their nparent not respecting boundaries and flat out ignoring requests? I realize I am such a people pleasing person and so easy going as my boundaries were never respected and I always just go with whatever was suggested or pushed onto me as to not cause an argument.

I can understand for people with normal parents this probably sounds like a sweet thing to say but when it comes from a narc parent it’s laced with venom.
Ive come to realise that from my nmom it served as a reminder that i was worthless, that the “love” i received from her was the only kind i was deserving off. 
I can see now this has definitely affected me a lot throughout my life in relationships and friendships, never thinking i was deserving of their love or forever sabotaging when things got too good.

1o5yc3b,Constantly feeling “on edge” around my dad’s criticism,"I live at home and my dad has this habit of constantly telling me what I “should” be doing—stuff like “you should exercise more,” “you should go out,” or even “8 hours of sleep should be enough, you should probably get up and do stuff.”

Even when he’s not home, I feel nervous, like I’m waiting for him to say something. Usually, instead of doing what he’s telling me, I end up doing the opposite—staying in bed, avoiding exercise, etc.—and feeling guilty about it the whole time.

I’m starting to wonder if this is a “freeze response” or some kind of stress response to his constant criticisms.

1o5yb7r,I thought I had a soulmate.  I had a conditioning.,"I remember the first time I saw my former BFF.  It was as if every light was trained to make her features sparkles.  I was the “awkward friend”.  She always wanted me around, but never outright stood up for me.  When we got to the boyfriend/girlfriend age, her first guy was the one I had been crushing on for a year.  I remember being hurt more at losing her.  I think she wanted that.

She always was the center.  She never liked when anyone “hurt” more than her.  When anyone contradicted the facts as she saw them.  When the career/life opportunities she wanted didn’t fall in her lap.

She had “clinical depression”.  Every day was impossible.  She would not order meds and then tell me and everyone who’d listen about her struggle.  Her children suffered (yay…plural…got that God feeling by making babies.)

When our friendship ended (I disagreed with her which was not allowed), I broke. 

She was my world.  My soulmate.  What was I without her?

That’s when I found the thing I never had but had always wanted.  No drama.

My father was a narcissist.  Life was always drama.  He was a “live hard, die young” kinda guy.  I spent my childhood chasing his love and approval.  I spent my adolescence and adulthood chasing hers.  

Without a narcissist god to revolve around, I found…quiet.

I now have a loving significant other.  No drama.  We talk.  We listen.  We apologize.  

I was conditioned to believe that love was dedicating yourself to someone else (parent, friend, etc.).  It’s not.

My partner doesn’t need me.  He loves me.  I’m learning that real love is in the quiet and calm.

I like it.

1o5y23b,"Is my mom a narcissist even if I'm not perfect? Still learning about narcissism. Seems like no way to be understood, talked to with respect or to change her mind","I (22, M) have problems with managing tasks that seem like ADHD. My mother earns money and does most of the housework. I feel bad about not helping her, but I struggle even with tasks related only to me. She told me that I don't respect her at all. I was puzzled by this statement and later tried to explain that I do respect her, and that me being lazy is not aimed strictly at her and that I don't want to make her feel bad and I need understadning on her side. Usually she says ""you make stuff up in your head"" or ""just have some discipline"". One time she said ""I've read about ADHD and it seems like it, you should see a therapist"", I said ""But you told me I make stuff up"" and she answered ""Yes, you think about it too much"".

One of examples. We had an agreement that I will clean my closet, but I forgot about it. She yelled at me. I became frustrated. I told her that I don't like being yelled at. She said that I make her yell. I told her that there are other ways of talking about it. She said ""I told you calmly and you didn't listen"" (turns out, and I admit it, she tried to remind me, but the reminder was unclear). I asked her that next time she makes sure my attention is focused on her words, reminds me of agreement, and sets a 2-day time to do it, and if I didn't do it until the middle of the second day she reminds me again, but calmly and with understanding and I will do it 99% chance. She told me that she is not responsible for my memory and ""no matter what I do, you always ask for even more. So I did it wrong? Why should I put effort in it?"" She suggested that I take notes, which is a valid alternative, but the way she talks about it makes me frustrated. The whole argument turned into a recursive blaming about how I do nothing for her, and that I don't respect her and only demand. Only 10 minutes after we talked I understood that she just reused arguments that I talked about in the beginning (me not doing stuff because I struggle with ADHD-like problems and I need understanding and a bit of help). Yes, now I can try to take notes, but it feels like what I said still was dismissed.

I understand that it's wrong that I provide almost no help, but I believe there are reasons, which, if talked about and brought to a calm solution, can change my behavior. What she offers me is just guilt. She is capable of apologising, some love (especially when everything is ok) and some understanding, but still she is very hard to talk to in disagreement situations. Another example:

\- Why don't you ask them to send you your documents?  
\- I asked them a few times, they prepared some, but still it takes longer than should.

\- Then do something about it.

\- I could go to that city and ask in person.

\- Who doesn't let you?

\- You.

\- Me?!?!?!  
\- Yes. You told me to not go to that city so I don't waste money and it's dangerous there.

\- You told me you want to visit your friend, not receive your documents.

\- It doesn't remove the ""dangerous part"". But, I actually think it's safe.

\- Then why don't you go there?! Who forbids?! Go there.

(????? Now I feel like I'm the one who was wrong)

I prepare to move out, but it still takes me a lot of time, because I have problems managing tasks. I want to go low contact (actually, no contact would be cooler, but I can try that). Am I wrong for thinking that any issue can be resolve without making someone feel guilt or being yelled at (because there is always a reason other than a person thinking ""ohohoho I'm sooo evil I'm gonna not help her on purpose ahahaha ahahaha"")?

1o5xvyu,Lying by a Narcissist vs. Delusions due to Early-Onset Alzheimer's/Dementia??,"Just wondering if anybody has any experience/advice, when it comes to telling the difference between the two.

I just overheard my Nmother on the phone with somebody that she's recently roped into her crap. *(The woman is a retured therapist; super kind, literally has bought us groceries because our SNAP case got screwed up a couple months ago... it's honestly sad to see her falling for the charade.)* There was so much said, just from the fraction of the call that I was able to hear... and So Much Of It Was False.

This isn't the first time I've wondered if she actually BELIEVED what she was claiming, or, if she was just ""upping the ante""/making up extra details, to make herself seem like the victim/the freakin' protagonist/like she's the one in the right.

She's in the age range for early-onset dementia, so, there's a genuinely-backed medical potential for it... plus pre-existing/occuring neurological issues *(seizures; brain abnormalities...)* ... so, it's hard to decide where to place my bets.

Wont go into more detail for anonymity. Since late 22 she has shown up unwelcome at my house and was trespassed at that time.  Numerous social media accounts have been made and attempts to reach out to me and one of my children since 2023.

1o5xivl,Cutting out family,"I think I've found my people. 31F, soon to be 32. Diagnosed schizoaffective with some other mental health issues like C-PTSD and possibly ADHD (though I question that diagnoses). There's a reason I mention this, but anyway. 

I *knew* after digging through some basic CBT therapy with a mediocre therapist that both my parents were abusive. Like, it was a given my dad was an abusive, narcissistic POS, but I always kinda lingered about my mom being abusive. I thought maybe it was trickle down abuse, ya know? Like my dad abused her, so she abused us. 

This kinda went away when psychosis struck. I was able to hold it together for a few months after a hospital inpatient stay, but when it blew up in my face, my mom basically kicked me out, choosing my shit-ass stepdad (who is a whole other abusive POS) over me. She sent me to my mom's house. 

Well, I have a problem with listening to the voices. And when in psychosis, it's like I lose control of my body. They talk through me. I get very little thoughts of my own. It's like these voices personify and become their own people. For a long time, I denied my diagnosis and thought I had DID/OSDD/tulpas. Anyway, I ended up smoking his cannabis, which just fueled my psychosis even more. At that point, I'd been off meds and on like a 3 month old injection of Abilify Maintana. I needed attention is what I'm saying. 

My dad found out I was stealing his cannabis and lost it on me. He hit me. Screamed at me for 30 minutes to an hour. One of the voices grey-rocked him the entire time, which just made things even worse. I was so out of it that I barely remember what was said between us. I just remember feeling fear but not feeling fear. Kinda like a flat effect. And hoping he'd beat me to death. 

After that, I got with my boyfriend and came up with a plan to leave. I called my mom to explain the situation with her. She of course took my dad's side. Said I ""shouldn't be stealing things."" I begged my boyfriend not to tell my mom anything about my plan to leave. I figured it would get back to my dad, and I was pretty scared for my life. He said it was already too late and he'd texted her. 

Well, news got to my sister, who called my dad and basically told him everything. He burst into the room, and I began recording everything if I recall correctly and made sure he knew I was recording. He just screamed more at me and told me to get the fuck out. So I was basically homeless. Mom came and got me, drove me to a hospital because I was homeless and needed to stay somewhere. I was psychotic, not stupid. Thankfully, hospital took me in and I began my journey on getting better. 

To this day, I have my sister blocked on everything. I don't know how to feel about my mom, and I refuse to talk to my father. I don't even wanna visit my mom anymore because of my POS stepdad, who made my life a living hell while I was there (I seriously had limits to how long I could use the bathroom). Every time I expressed concern with what he was telling me, like how I was making him mad, forgetting to lock the door (even though he'd fall asleep in the recliner with the door wide open), and limiting my bathroom time, she'd excuse his behavior by saying, ""He's 70 years old. I'm sorry. I know he's a pain."" And just... supporting my dad for choking, hitting, and pushing me? While I was psychotic? 

It makes me want to cry. My family has never really supported me. Me standing up for myself was always seen as disruptive and as the eldest child, I had tremendous responsibilities put on me while my brother and sister just skid by. My boyfriend doesn't want me to cut my mom out because what if he needs help in ""dealing with me"" when and if I go into psychosis again? 

Personally, I'm considering just moving out entirely. I just started working. I'm saddled with a LOT of debt and plan on paying it off as quickly as possible. I just... IDK. I feel so alone with this? I was completely abandoned and had no where to go. Nothing to do. My boyfriend swears my mom told him she considered getting me a hotel room for the night, but like... what the actual fuck? It feels like if I died or fell off the face of the planet, it wouldn't even matter. 

IDK my whole family is full of fucked up narcissists. I have severe C-PTSD from this and other instances with my family. I'm not stranger to being hit by my dad and then love bombed for like 30 seconds to a minute of bombarded apologies and ""I'm sorry. I love you, you know that right?""

1o5x2zy,Unsure of whether to confront ndad about behavior,"My dad is getting older and lately he's been sending a lot of text messages and emails trying to ""get through to me"". I really hesitate to respond because I have had my head chewed off more times than I can count since I was a child, and I never know what kind of response I am going to get. 

He's interested in a relationship now that I ""have more direction in my life"" (I'm pregnant with my fiance). Some examples of what I have come to expect when coming to him for support - when I was going through a divorce several years ago, he was fully against the divorce and aggressively tried to get me to stay with my ex-husband, including inviting my ex to my brother's wedding against my wishes. When my dog died a year later, I called him crying (huge mistake) and he yelled at me that I was ""all drama"". When I was 21, I told him that his best friend was a creep, and he screamed at me that going to college turned me into a feminist. His friend went to a federal prison for 25 years for pedophilia and is still there.

So, I don't trust my dad. But there is a part of me that does want to make it crystal clear why I avoid him so much. I really haven't told him. I just stopped answering, stopped engaging and went VLC without ever being able to bring myself to have the conversation because he is so unstable and mean. 

Now, he keeps trying to open the door. Should I tell him why I avoid him? I risk him tearing me to shreds again, and I don't want to give myself any false hope that he somehow cares or wants to change. But part of me wants to tell him why I avoid him so much.

I usually make the holiday dinner but didn’t this year because my family has been going through a hard time and I’m completely burnt out and dealing with depression. When my family found out I wasn’t going to make dinner they got upset at me and planned their own. They know I have depression because I told them. Myself, husband and kids were not invited. Which is awful because for the last decade I’ve made the holiday dinners. The one time I’m struggling they just abandone me. Today I received a Happy Thanksgiving! Text message from my mom. How do I respond? Ignoring them makes them more mad but they are so toxic I don’t want to respond and it feels mean that they send a text after they left us out. How would you respond?

1o5wz1r,My mother is violent towards my father,"Since I was little, the relationship between my two parents has been horrible. Their arguments are extremely violent (yelling, breaking, hitting, crying, heartbreak, etc.). My father cheated on my mother and my mother did the same to get revenge. She never forgave him and since then she has been very physically and psychologically violent with him. This involves constant reproaches, daily humiliations and recently a knife threat. For several years I have been followed by psychologists for this situation. I feel immense pain for both, it goes around in a loop in my head to the point where I can't sleep all night. I feel very alone in this situation. Apart from telling myself that I should file a complaint against my mother or simply detach myself from the situation, I don't see any other advice. And no one seems to be going through a similar situation. I am unable to file a complaint against my mother especially since I did not directly see the knife scene; it was told to me by my father afterwards.

1o5vogw,Am I rude for talking back?,"For context im a (17F) turning 18 soon, I lost my dad a few years back so it's just been her, my 3 brothers and a few other family members

It feels like everyday I'm walking on eggshells with her, one minute I'm being yelled out ""Grow up!"", fat shamed ""you should do some push ups you look fat, no guy like a fat girl if he says he does his lying"" or being called names ""your so folish!/ungrateful"" the next she's all lovely dovey, asking to make me food to even helping me out when I need it . It feels like I can never have a conversation with her without feeling like ""Oh, will she get mad it me or yell?""/ ""how will she react, will I get yelled at?""

She stopped hitting me when I was 12. But her and my dad used to. I would sometimes distance myself for them and my dad would immediately apologise and even spoil me, but my mom will call me childish and would practically rage bait me or mock me into forgiving her. Growing up in an African household I was always told it was a normal thing ""tough love"" or ""I want you to be a better person"" she would also do this to others even her own mother (my grandma) when things didn't go her way and then when I do the same thing she hits me with a ""I have never treated my mom like the way you treat me/ your so rude and disrespectful!""

I do hate her sometimes but hate is a strong word, it's more like a mixed feeling, I love her but she makes me feel so (idk weak). I have problems with social skills always trying to think before I talk scared that a person would yell. If they did my brain will literally shut down, I find it hard to learn and try not to make someone irritated or even more angry that I feel so dumb and stupid when I can't think of an answer, always fidget or scratch my hand as well

My teachers also played a part in this? Always yelling thinking it would make things go in your brain better that way.

Recently I learnt how to fight back with my mom, she was tutoring me in a subject (For upcoming exams) and I was so tired she made me stay up till 1:40am and made my wake up at 5 to continue. She would explain and I wouldn't get  it sometimes and then she'd yell
Then she asked questions bit yelled at me when I didn't answer the answer she wanted (my answer was right) when I told her about it she got up and called me names, saying that she was older and that I was just rude and ungrateful 

It hurt me so much because I always tried to be what she wanted , dressed how she wanted even obeyed because she had bp but then I realized that it shouldn't be like this

I still talk back and she always calls me out on it, leaves the conversation when she's wrong (she's like this with everyone). I'm still putting boundaries but I just want to talk to someone (even online)

1o5ukbx,Nparents sent money twice and now I feel gross,"You can read my post history if you want. So… long story short, I went no contact with my parents about three years ago after years of manipulation, neglect, and straight-up trauma. Recently, someone who knows them reached out to me under the guise of “wanting to help,” but I quickly realized she was just trying to mediate and get me to reconnect.

I asked for some financial help since I’m moving for a new job, and my parents actually sent me money. I knew it was a gamble but I needed funds immediately. I needed more money so I sent a request again, but this time, I tried to play them at their game by using fake emotion and stuff so they would send it again without question. I know I shouldn’t have done that, but it’s all I could’ve done. Pls don’t clown me lol.

But their messages after that felt off — like this weird culty “God opened this door for us” energy. They kept saying stuff like:

“We as your parents love you and want what’s best for you.”
“God wants us to walk through this door together.”
“Even a 5-minute video call so we can see your face.”

They completely ignored my boundary that said if they ever wanted reconnection, they’d need to go to therapy individually and do actual inner work. I wouldn’t ever reconnect anyway but I felt like I had to say that so they would send money.

I’m grateful for the financial help, I’m not gonna ask again because I’m better off now, but their words gave me this gross, suffocating feeling — like they’re trying to spiritually manipulate me back into contact. It’s unsettling. I worked in a mental health hospital before, so I’m picking up all the signs of control and love-bombing. I blocked them again immediately.

I’m not scared, just deeply uncomfortable and kinda disgusted. I already decided I’m done asking for help, but I just wanted to know — am I overreacting? Has anyone else experienced this type of “godly guilt trip” from narcissistic parents after going no contact? How can I shake this?

1o5tf4p,Concerned about my mother's obsession with pseudoscience.,"TLDR: Mom too stubborn and ignorant to listen to scientific facts became too into alternative science, esotericism, flat earthiness and the like.

My mother has always been a text book narcissist. I could list dozens of fights I've had with her simply because she refuses to look at the evidence presented right in front of her. Tried to convince her I did my homework and even show her the progress I've made? No, I was playing video games because she said so. Showed her pictures of me with my friends to prove that I wasn't at the disco or whatever? No, apparently I smell of alcohol (I don't even drink). Ever since I have a working memory, her way to cope with being wrong was to simply not do so, and double down on whatever her stance was.

I've stopped caring about it over the years, simply because instead of grounding me she shifted to employing the silent treatment, which was a lot more tolerable. And I realized I could never get her to admit to being wrong or apologize. Not once has she admitted her mistakes, be it to me or to anyone.

These last few years, she had been getting more into alternative sciences (if I can even call them that) ever since she began to have more access to the internet and had her own smartphone. First it started with manifestation and the law of attraction, then she moved to believing the earth is flat, then reptilians, ancient civilizations that somehow now live in another galaxy, the US government secretly trying to give us all cancer, you name it.

And of course, whenever I or my father try to challenge her ideas, she gets pissed and refuses to talk to us.

And it's all because of Instagram and TikTok. All the stupid, out of this world ideas she gets come from people who, seemingly, derive joy from misleading others to buy their shitty courses just so they can make a profit. Those have got to be the lowest of the low. She's partly to blame too, of course, for believing everything she sees in there without a second thought.

This is where my concern comes from. None of this ""learning"" has resulted in her harming herself, physically speaking. The most she has done is pay for their courses. But I'm worried about whether she will stop there.

1o5sxij,It's Not You - Dr. Ramani,"It's Not You, by Dr. Ramani, Book Review.

I just completed Dr. Ramani's new book.  She has been such an amazing resource to me in my healing, and would highly recommend all of you check out her YouTube videos.  I'm a lifelong learner and over the past 5 years of intense healing have read about 60 books on this topic and on related topics.   I found her book very enlightening and recommend it to those who may be interested.

This is the first book on the topic I have read which was able to cover the two main types of narcissistic relationships: being raised by narcissists parents and romantic relationships.   Of course, there are also types:> friendships and work relationships, but most books target one or the other.   Even as those of us who were rbn also likely were impacted by romantic relationships with narcisists.  Yet none of the books I have read really integrate the two.  Either they target relationships, which usually cover a male abuser with a female victim.  I'm 57/m, and as a result this latter category  of books has been less helpful for me (although still has been useful).    There are also different dynamics in a relationship with a parent vs. a romantic relationship that can be difficult to highlight.   Dr. Ramani is able to bring light to both of them. 

Not all people who are in narcissitic romantic relationship grew up with nParents.  She points out that some people might have actually been raised with good parents, and then when they got to the romantic narc relationship, they learn a whole new reality.  They were taught all the good things about a loving relationship, where things can be talked out, you can trust the other, and many other lessons.  Yet, they did not learn that there are people for which normal relationship behavior does not work (you know which kind).  I always thought about wanting to have had parents that treated me 'properly'.  Yet forgot that that can still leave some vulnerable to narcs.   I really liked how she brought both of these journeys into play.

Another area I revised my view on is narcissism.  Most books list the traits, let you check off those which you have experienced, and boom - if they check off a majority, well they are narcisistics.  End of story, right?    She teaches that (like most things in life) narcissism is a spectrum, or scale.   She says even psychologists can take months to determine of someone actually has narcissistic personality syndrome.   How can we, who have not had that level of study on a topic know?  The point being, people can still have very strong characteristics of narcissim, even if it is only in one or two areas.   There are many types of narcs, and most are covert.   Not all of them appear like a mad king who thinks he/she controls the all aspects of the world and who require constant praise.  

Dr. Ramani also has excellent chapters on grief, and on becoming (more) resistant to the narcissist. She teaches more about if you choose to go no contact, but also gives advice on when you don't want to go to that measure.   

I really liked this book, found it helpful and would recommend it to others.   I feel a special place for Dr. Ramani, as she has provided so many great videos for those of us in healing.  She has lived it herself and she has helped numerous to heal.  Thank you Dr. Ramani!  Namaste

1o5sw0f,How do you go low or no contact with a sibling who enables narcissistic parents?,"Hi everyone! A few years ago, I posted here about my parents (classic narcissistic traits, control, emotional manipulation, boundary violations, etc.) and the challenges I faced after my son was born. 

Curious for thoughts on how to handle my brother. He’s ten years older than me, and when I was in my twenties, I stood up for him and his wife when our parents treated them terribly after they got married, and we both ended up no-contact with our parents. I thought we were on the same side, trying to break the cycle as we became more aware of the household we grew up in.

Lately, I’ve realized I’ve been the one keeping our relationship alive. I’ve flown across the country to see him and his family, while he rarely visits or checks in, even with my son in the picture. He never stands up for me to our parents, even when they’ve crossed serious lines.

He’s often guilted into visiting them. Their kids stay there, and my mom even had a panic attack during one of those visits (which he kept from his wife). Yet he doesn’t make the same effort to see us. It feels like he keeps choosing our parents over me. He's even had my parents fly to his city and babysit the kids when he goes on vacation with his wife.

My brother still enables them, whether to keep the peace or because he’s conditioned not to rock the boat. I don’t think he has the capacity to be supportive, and while I empathize that he also grew up in a dysfunctional home, I feel like I don’t have him around at all.

This weekend I stumbled upon this short [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chiD5nt-T5E) describing something known as the **borderline personality organization** and now her behavior makes much more sense. She definitely has a borderline personality organization, and probably has a [paranoid](https://psentraining.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/The-Paranoid-Character.pdf)/histrionic personality structure which can look a lot like internet/pop-psychology narcissism.

1o5pzbl,Should I answer my dad?,"Hi! So I (26F) received a letter from my dad (estranged for 6 years now). It's not the first time he contacted me, but back in June I wrote him a letter. The city where I live (UK) is notorious for bad post so I wasn't surprised that it never got delivered, but I was also secretly relieved. The reason I am here is that I don't know whether I should contact him again or not. On one side, I could be setting myself up for getting hurt once more, for complicating family dynamics (my two younger siblings are still in touch with him,) and reverting to my former self that was hurt (physically and emotionally) beyond words by him. 

As some context, the estrangement between myself and him came after a case of stalking where the police got involved and told him to leave me alone. This comes after years of emotional abuse and two instances of physical abuse eight years ago. I'll summarise the letter here, oh, and for context, my father is an artist and author.

\-He tells me he is working on a new book and during the creation of a large vignette he realises that the book is based entirely upon me.

\-He recounts a past memory where we are in my grandfather's allotment, digging for potatoes. I hold up what I proclaim is a potato whilst my two siblings are 'vying for the attention of all the adults present', however the potato is in fact a pebble. 

\-He describes how proud he felt of me and how much love he felt in that moment.

\-He goes on to describe parenthood as being 'punctuated by these overwhelming waves of emotion, where it feels like you are in the presence of something divine.'

\-He then speaks at length about this realisation.

\-He says he can only apologise for what he 'mishandled or screwed up' if we are talking.

\-Finally, he tells me he is visiting my city periodically over the next few months and asks if we can speak. 

  
Here's the catch - that story about the potato is about my sibling (24NB) who was always his favourite, not about me. The letter did however make me think about getting back in touch with him. I drafted a text saying that we could go for a beer and not hash it out but just catch up, but never sent it. I know what each of my friends will say I should do from their own biases, that's why I am here amongst my people. What should I do? I kind of want to speak to him but I don't know if I actually want to put myself in that risky position. What would you do?

1o5pqqs,My freedom manifesto,"I was venting to ChatGPT about my toxic upbringing and it generated this 10 commandmends (if you will). Hope this helps anyone in their healing journey!

**My Freedom Manifesto**

1. My life belongs to me

I am the one who lives inside my choices every day, not my parents, relatives, or society. Advice is optional; autonomy is not. I decide what peace looks like for me.

2. Respect must go both ways

Culture without respect is control. If a tradition harms, silences, or shames me, I have the right to step away from it. Real dharma is truth and compassion, not fear and obedience.

3. I am not here to fix my parents’ story

Their marriage, their regrets, their fears are their karma. I carry empathy, not responsibility. My duty is to heal, not to rescue.

4. I choose courage over “log kya kahenge”

People will always talk, but they don’t feed, shelter, or heal me. Approval is temporary; self-respect is permanent. I release the need to look acceptable and choose to be authentic.

5. Fear no longer runs my life

My mother stayed because of fear. I walk forward because of clarity. I will not let inherited anxiety dictate my future.

6. Boundaries are sacred

Silence, distance (including going no-contact), and “no” are legitimate forms of self-care. I owe politeness, not access. Peace is a full sentence.

7. Service keeps me grounded

Compassion for animals and people is how I live my dharma. Kindness is my ritual; integrity is my prayer.

8. Healing is my rebellion

I was born to end cycles of abuse, guilt, and silence, by living differently. That is strength—not endurance of pain, but refusal to pass it on.

9. I’m building a life that feels like safety

Not performance, not duty—safety. My relationships will be chosen for respect, not reputation. My home will be a place of calm, not control.

10. I am free

Free to love, to rest, to make mistakes, to learn, to start again. Freedom is not selfish; it’s sacred.",ssriram12,1760375488.0,1,0.6,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o5pqqs/my_freedom_manifesto/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o5pqqs/my_freedom_manifesto/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o5pob3,How do I tell my nSister that I don’t want any gifts or inheritance from her because she can’t be both a hero and a bully?,"I’m VLC with my nSister. Any communication between us is only in writing. 

After my recently nMom died, she became the owner of my late nDad’s company which is partially paying for my inheritance through a trust fund. 

She wrote to me earlier this year that she has an estate lawyer, that she’s now the owner of my nDad’s company, that she doesn’t agree with the terms of my trust fund and that she wants to sell the company and give me part of the money she gets from that. Before I could even decide whether and how to reply, I realized that the distribution from my trust fund decreased because the money from my nDad’s company suddenly stopped coming to me (despite that the executor of my nDad and mMom’s estate authorized that distribution).

 So, my nSister cancelled my trust fund distribution behind my back and now wants to be like a hero and give me part of her inheritance.

How do I explain to her that I don’t want any kind of relationship with her even if it’s monetary? She can’t be a hero and also systemic bully who has severely traumatized me and gave me PTSD. 

Will only a letter from a lawyer be able to get to her realize that? A relationship can’t be bought. And given that she canceled my trust fund distribution from my nDad’s company behind my back, she hasn’t changed and still remains abusive and hurtful.

She has never acknowledged her hurtful actions nor the consequences of her actions, so I doubt that she’ll understand that my decision to not want any relationship with her or gifts from her is a consequence of her actions. 

Should first contact the executor to let him know what my nSister did?

1o5pmag,something my mother said and it made me look at her differently.,"Well, I wrote two posts here already, but I deleted them (I don't know why. I guess I'll just share a few memories for now.) I think for now I will write down the situations that make my family 100% insane.

I don't know if I should write about this because it doesn't directly concern me, but it reminded me of this. If this is the wrong subreddit, let me know. 

TW: suicide, changes about shootings

Context: It all started when I read about the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School. I don't remember how old I was when I first read about it, but I was already at an age where I understood the scale of the tragedy, and as I got older, this matter began to sadden me more and more because most of the children who died there would be my age now, and one of the victims even had a birthday the day before mine. That's why this particular shooting affects me very personally. 

Let's rewind to now. This was a time when I didn't yet realize my mother was a narcissist (or I was denying it). I felt somehow sad (I think it was after the Nong Bua Lamphu shooting). I remember saying some time later that I was sad because it reminded me of another shooting (I didn't say ""Sandy Hook"" because I'm not from the USA and my family is from the Europe, so my mother wouldn't even know what I was talking about. Although I think there was a mention of Sandy Hook in the report about Nong Bua Lamphu, but my mother probably forgot and didn't pay attention). 

I also mentioned that the father of one of the victims most likely (by ""most likely,"" I meant that there was no single confirmation, or that I couldn't find any) committed suicide a few years later. (I didn't mention who I was referring to because I thought it was pointless, since we live in Europe anyway and my mother wouldn't even know who he was. You can easily find out who I'm talking about; I feel uncomfortable mentioning real people.) 

I still remember my mother's words, spoken with disbelief, perhaps even indifference and disgust. ""Just because his child died doesn't mean he should kill himself. After all, the child needs to go to school."" After I explained to her why he had made this decision and how he blamed himself for his child's death (or at least that's what I understood from what his wife had told me.) 

Then I remember looking at her, dumbfounded, not knowing what to say. I just thought, ""Mom, wtf? You're a mother yourself."" I don't know what it's like to lose a child, but I understood this man's pain more than my mother, who has three children and says something like that. 

The saddest thing is that when a friend of hers died in a motorcycle accident when he was younger, and his father committed suicide because he blamed himself for his son's death, because he had given him the bike that day, she said, ""I feel sorry for the guy."" With sincere regret. She had told this story many times, and at that moment, it came back to me. 

I didn't understand, and I don't think I want to understand, why she would speak so highly of a man she didn't even know. She sympathizes with one, but can't sympathize with the other, despite similarities.

Now when I remember it, I feel disgust and want to strangle her until she takes back what she said. 

Or another situation. I don't remember how it happened, but somehow it turned to my suicide attempt. My mother said, ""You're brave if you're still alive."" The point was that if I'm alive, I chose courage, and that's admirable. I remember saying something about the rise in suicides among teenagers, and my mother said, ""They don't know what they're doing."" I honestly don't know how to explain what she meant by that because I don't know myself. And yes, you read that correctly. She said those words two sentences after saying I was brave because I chose life over death. She told this to her daughter, who had tried to overdose on pills four years earlier, and the only thing that helped was that my throat constricted, making it impossible to swallow the pills. 

But I knew these words weren't normal. I felt anger at her words. Not even because of me (although I think they were also meant for me, as she'd said more than once that my suicide attempt was ""for attention""), but because it offended so many young people (and others) who are no longer here because of suicide. 

I apologize for any mistakes; English isn't my native language, so I'm using a translator for long posts. The post is chaotic, and I debated several times whether I should post it, but I decided to do it. I won't deny that I cried at times, which forced me to emotionally detach myself, which meant it took me 3-4 days to write. It took me a month to share it because I wondered if it was a good idea.

If this post ever reaches any relatives of the man I mentioned, I apologize for what my mother said about him. I also apologize if anyone reading this was offended because they are struggling with this and/or have lost a relative to suicide. Remember, you matter.

1o5pjfv,Realizing the ‘good’ parent is just as bad as the narc,"I grew up with an ndad and an enabler mom. She never stood up for me as a child or protected me against my dad. I thought just because my mom wasn't abusing me, that meant she was the 'good' parent. I put up with it as a child out of fear but when I became teenager, I wasn’t as scared as I was as a little girl or submissive like my mom and my dad hated that. Whenever he would lash out at her, I’d yell at him to stop. I could take his abuse, but I couldn’t stand seeing him hurt her. I just felt this urge to step in and stop it, I couldn't just sit there and watch. Afterwards, she’d hug me and thank me for protecting her and gossip about how horrible my dad is while also never leaving him.

I moved out a long time ago and I've had time to reflect on everything. I didn't want to admit to how damaging my mom's behavior really was because all this time I wanted to believe I had at least I had one good parent. I feel like I've been duped, realising now that I never had any. Why didn't she leave? or at least protect me, even one time?

Is it fair to cut her off? I live in a different country and call her once a week out of pure guilt. I've already cut my dad off, but they're still married so he gets to hear about my life through her, which sucks. I've never approached her about being an enabler (the whole rest of my family are enablers too so I'd have no one if I did cut her off, they'd take her side). I think she thinks because she didn't 'abuse' me she hasn't done anything wrong. If I were to just go n/c I think the fallout would be nuclear. First of all, she'd think I died in some tragic accident and probably be on the first flight over, and I don't want that.

I will not talk to her, and I do not plan on talking to her ever again unless she actually takes accountability and reflects on her behavior, which seems just about as likely as pigs starting to fly.   
I realized though, that back in august 2023 or whenever it was that I blocked her for good, I never really explained why I did that, because I guess even though she's actually the worst and probably doesn't deserve and explanation, I still want to give her an explanation, just to cover my ass I suppose. But I'm really not sure if its a good idea or not. I have the whole thing written out, its in a draft in my email, but I am absolutely terrified to press send. I don't know if this is going to be a mistake or not.   
So, that's why I'm asking here. Has anyone had to do this before, and how did it go when you did it? what did you learn from the experience?

1o5pef3,"Not responsible for my mom’s pain, but she acts like I am","Just happened: I was massaging my mom’s back like I do every day because she’s always in pain. Normally it’s half an hour with pinching, hitting, and the massage device. Today, I told her I had sore muscles, hoping she’d let me take it easy. She kind of shrugged and said “yeah… whatever” and then softly added something like “but it still doesn’t help.” My brother even said to her, “He really doesn’t care, huh?” and she just replied “yeah, I know,” and then both of them shook their heads.

I hate doing this every day. I’m not responsible for making her pain go away. If she wants to go to physio every day, fine—whatever—but leave me out of it. It’s exhausting having my feelings ignored like this, even though I know she’s in pain.

1o5osgy,I don’t know where to start,"I could give a long backstory and context, but I hope that’s not needed. short context: it’s taken me years to realize I was raised by narcissists, but eventually I moved out and that created a nice distance between us and even though it’s not been great, it’s been way better. unfortunately right after I moved out (I think within 6 months), both my parents got ill (dad had a bad stroke, which made him a lot nicer weirdly enough, mom’s diabetes led to a leg amputation and several hospitalizations before and after), so in a way I felt like I got sucked back in, as the “golden child”, to take care of them, visit them more frequently than I’d like, arranging all kinds of care for them (which they of course dismiss and don’t actually use). this was years ago, it eventually calmed down and I gradually stepped back again and it was at least manageable again. 

now, mom is hospitalized again, and it’s bad (as usual) again, and I don’t know what happened, but holy shit, she is in full narc mode and I’m more resentful than ever before about it. it’s like I’ve completely run out of patience, sympathy, empathy for her. I work full time, take care of my dad wherever I can, visit my mom in the hospital and even if I see them 5/6 out of 7 days, you bet on the off days I don’t, I get a guilt tripping text or call, with some “emergency” or asking why I’m not there today. 

I tried to seek therapy to deal with this through my GP, and I got recommended an ACT therapist (Acceptance and Commitment therapy), but I feel like I just keep getting told I need to accept it all. I need to accept my parents/mom being horrible, accept them getting older and needing more care, especially from me. I just need to get over myself and the past and step up, basically, because hanging onto the past and my current struggles with the present is what’s hurting me. to a certain extent, I get this. yes, I do need to accept that “it is what it is”, my mom isn’t going to change and more horrifying, she probably will only get worse with age, and I should just move on from all the resentment I hold and find (different) ways to cope, but holy shit. 

I feel insane for feeling like I also need some kind of acknowledgment from anyone who knows what I’m talking about that this anger and resentment I feel towards her is somehow just even a little bit justified and that I need to process that and everything that led me to feel this *before* I can go into accepting. I just don’t feel like I get the chance to even touch all the shit that has happened to make me this upset and honestly I don’t even want to dive into all (because “what happens in the family, stays in the family”), but I (as usual) feel like I need to overexplain myself and prove why this is hitting as hard as it is. 

I’m sorry if this is not very clear and coherent, but I’m so frustrated and angry and tired and resentful and cynical and it’s making me someone I don’t want to be and I feel like wherever I look for support or understanding, I just get told it’s my fault for being this upset, because I simply shouldn’t be. I should just simply move on from years of neglect and abuse, because “it is what it is”.

My nMom poked her head into my room, asking for a favor. She asked if I would be willing to drive to the nearest gas station and buy some cigarettes for her and my ndad.

I immediately said “I can’t, I’m not old enough. I have to be 21, now.” Her reaction still makes me smile to this day. She threw her head back, threw an arm up, and shouted, “aw, fuck!” Then walked away.

It felt amazing because she knew she couldn’t get around that. I legally couldn’t buy cigarettes, and as crazy as she was, she wasn’t going to make her son break the law.

To the woman who calls herself my mother: This statement is not written out of anger, but out of clarity. I am choosing to document the truth of my upbringing so that silence no longer protects the person who caused it. You denied me care and safety while presenting yourself to others as a devoted parent. You withheld food, clothing, and basic necessities as punishment, openly telling me you would no longer support me. When I earned my own income through legitimate art commissions, you attempted to discredit me by telling family members that I was a scammer using a false identity. You did not support me — you attempted to sabotage my independence. You forced me into the role of caretaker. You regularly claimed to be suffering from various illnesses — cancer, bronchitis, COVID, strokes, heart attacks, seizures — expecting me to tend to you. Whether those illnesses were real or fabricated, the intent was clear: to keep me in a position of obligation and control. At other times, you abandoned responsibility altogether, taking sleep medication during the day and becoming incoherent while I was forced to manage the fallout. You exposed me to substance abuse and danger. You became intoxicated while holding me as an infant, cut yourself, and poured blood on me while claiming it was a cleansing ritual. Throughout my life, you insisted you were a witch and forced me to ingest substances you mixed together, to bathe in dirt, and to keep cups of soil in my room. Refusal was met with threats and aggression. You once gave me your own prescription sleep medication when I was nine years old, leading to hospitalization. You engaged in medical manipulation. You forced me to lie to doctors about ADHD prescriptions so that you could take the medication yourself. You restricted my access to communication by removing my phone service when I discovered your infidelity. You prevented me from contacting outside support. You prioritized abusive relationships and chaos over stability. At eight years old, I was removed from school for extended periods so you could pursue a drug-addicted partner. We were evicted because rent money was diverted toward that pursuit. I missed education due to your choices. When my older brother moved into the home, you reassigned my bedroom to him and demanded that I clean up after him and tolerate any behavior without protest. If I objected, I was accused of cruelty. You weaponized religion and psychological manipulation. At seven years old, you told me the world was ending soon and that I would burn in hell if I did not treat you with reverence. You told me I had a “good childhood” solely because I had never been sexually assaulted, as if the absence of one form of trauma excused all others. When I experienced extreme bullying at ten years old and attempted suicide, you were not concerned with my safety or wellbeing. Instead, you expressed anger that Child Protective Services might intervene and affect your government benefits. When I was allowed temporary freedom — such as trips with friends — you demanded immediate emotional repayment. You claimed to have laid on my bedroom floor for days in my absence and declared I was never to leave you again. If I spent time with friends, you accused their parents of grooming or turning me against you. When I asked for help or expressed discomfort, you called law enforcement and portrayed yourself as a victim while police dismissed my situation because there was food in a pantry.
You threatened to remove me from school — including during my senior year — over minor disputes such as unwashed dishes. You eventually carried out eviction, forcing me out of the home two weeks before high school graduation. Later, you threatened to report me missing if I did not maintain contact on your terms, despite knowing exactly where I was.
To those who have been convinced that I was “ungrateful,” understand this: A child having clothes in a dresser or food in a cabinet does not negate abuse. Parenting is not defined by providing objects — it is defined by providing safety. A roof is not care. Fear is not discipline. Dependency is not love. If you continued to support Amanda after hearing her version of events, that is because you received a performance. Manipulators often construct communities that echo their narrative. I will not participate in that narrative any longer. This statement is not an invitation for debate. It is documentation. I owe no one further explanation. I am no longer your caretaker, your scapegoat, your emotional possession, or your shield. I will not be silent to protect the reputation of someone who never protected me.",ezzyeden,1760372064.0,27,0.97,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o5o4q2/did_anyone_else_have_a_mother_who_was_loved_by/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o5o4q2/did_anyone_else_have_a_mother_who_was_loved_by/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o5ntuq,"My mom keeps stealing/throwing away my stuff because ""I'm a hoarder and shopping addict""","Usually it's small stuff, like socks and underwear. Annoying but nothing worth reporting stolen. Sometimes it's bigger stuff, like bags or shirts. Infuriating, but not bad enough that anyone takes it seriously. Even moreso because my mom has everyone convinced I'm mentally ill and struggle with hoarding or a shopping addiction. Neither of which are true, and even if it was, I find that very insulting coming from someone who receives temu/shein packages every week and has gotten out mailbox jammed because of it several times. 

That aside, today it entailed a new tie I got at the thrift store this weekend and wanted to wear to my several job interviews this week and she just, lost it. She claims, as per usual, it's just in my ""garbage pile"" or ""barnyard of a room"", but I've got eyes mom, it's not. It was in the laundry, washed it, now it's not. 

I feel pathetic for having such a big crash out over a tiny piece of fabric, but also... All those bags and shirts I've lost, as well as other items... If anything, that's contributing more to hoarding tendencies because I can't be in control of my own stuff. Nothing is ever truly mine. 

She once threw away a safe box with ~200 cash savings, a lot at the time. She didn't have the keys to it and had no way to get that money, she just didn't want me to have it. 

And if you still think I'm crazy, she used to outright admit she did it. When I was a kid, shed sometimes ask ""can you grab x bag or y shirt"", I'd go to my room and not see it, and then she'd explain she threw it away 3 weeks ago and clearly I didn't miss it that much. 

But yeah no I'm still mentally crashing out, but no way to  physically release it so I can't get out of it.

1o5nn9z,Trying to process abusive childhood,"TW: abuse, violence, ableism

I was diagnosed with autism when I was 4-5. My parents never accepted it and were convinced I was a broken, defective, fucked up kid. My dad wanted to “fix” the autism with violent regular beatings, verbal abuse and degradation, threats to send me to foster care and to the psych ward. He dragged me by the hair on the floor, choked me, destroyed my belongings in rage. My dad thought that all of that would “fix” the autism and make me “normal”.

This went on until I fled home at 19 terrified for my life. I was prepared to sleep on the streets and die there - that was preferable to going back to my dad. I then saw a bunch of therapists and they told me I had abusive parents who severely traumatized me and that I was probably not autistic.

I cut contact with my parents a year later. Upon informing him that I was cutting contact, he stalked me, trespassed on my property at midnight multiple times, called the cops on me two times saying I was suicidal (I was not), left super threatening voicemails on my phone about my dad insisted that I was “mentally ill” for wanting to cut my parents out of my life, that he did “nothing wrong” (lol) and that once I “calmed down” from my “autistic episode” we could talk “properly”. he also said that he would go find my therapist at the time and show her “documentation” about how I was “mentally fucked up and broken autist” and that my parents were only trying to do the best they could for me to “fix” me. he also said that I was not allowed to cut him off because I was his daughter and that I couldn’t do that.

I had to move to stop this harassment and stalking and block my parents everywhere.

I have been in therapy for dépression, complex PTSD for several years now. I am working on the insecurity and deep shame that my dad instilled in me that I was fundamentally broken. I ought to believe I am enough already to love, that other people in my life now love me as I am.

I am trying to undo all the damage from my dad who told me my whole life about how unloveable I was, how much of a horrible person I was, that no one would ever want to be friends with me or date me, how I was ugly and fat and repulsive, how I was at the bottom of the hierarchy of human beings and how I was so worthless that if I got r*ped I 100% deserved it & it would be my fault & that if it weren’t for him, I’d be a homeless crackhead who would not even graduate elementary school.

I am writing here because it is very difficult and I was hoping to find people who went through similar experiences who might understand.

I have no idea how to tell my Nparents that i do not wish to celebrate it, mostly worried about my small nephew not understanding why a day with cake and presents is something i want to get rid of. Most likely my parents will say that i am just confusing the kid and setting a bad image for the family. YOU GUYS MADE YOUR IMAGE ALREADY AND IT SUCKS!

I'm honestly thinking of turning off my phone for the day and taking a trip to some shithole just to get away.

1o5mzgd,Why is grey rocking so hard? She pretended to be nice and I caved in….,"I’ve been LC with my mom for a month after her reacting with rage to being called out for her behavior. We live in different countries, I stopped calling, she’s been messaging me and demanding that I call, I’ve been trying to grey rock.

It’s SO hard. The logical part of me knows she will never change, she will never acknowledge my feelings with empathy, and her DARVO messages are nothing but a temper tantrum.

But then one day she seems more apologetic. Still not actually apologizing for the long-term patterns that hurt me the most (invalidation, gaslighting, criticism, blame shifting etc.) and not respecting my wish to not talk. But she apologizes for “raising her voice” and promises not to do that, sounds sincere. I was still feeling too unsafe to resume phone calls, but considered it for a minute. 

But then I express concern about the gaslighting pattern, and she immediately explodes with textbook DARVO. Completely denying everything. It’s too painful to even read. I considered giving her a chance, but she just showed me her true colors once again.

Some of the gaslighting is truly insane and her denial of it makes me furious, but I remain helpless. She will say “Can you explain in what ways I’m invalidating you? Because I truly don’t understand. Give me specific examples”, and when I respond, she immediately says “Those are not examples” (!!) and throws more and more DARVO in response to each point.

It’s so bizarre. I feel so unsafe, scared and dreadful all the time, even tho I’m not even in a physical proximity to her.

She hates that ""Congress stuff"" but watches Fox News.  Make it make sense.  She watches all manner of daytime TV shows at insane volumes, blames everyone else for her problems, rages the second something bothers her, goes from 0-100 in an instant at the slightest thing that she usually seeks out to justify her baseline rage, but doesn't see her own behavior as problematic.  She looks at me while I don't react and thinks I'm trying to make her mad.  Fails to see how my children's peace is more important than her outrage over literal crumbs under a chair or a clean towel folded and not in a place she would like it, even though it's on a wall shelf in the bathroom next to the shower.

It's insane how absolutely abusive she is and how everyone just puts up with it or makes excuses..

She couldn't be bothered by Congressional dismantling of everything she knows but she is demonizing my children for laughing at 7:45 a.m. before they get out of bed.  Blaming them for being in the way.

Told me she wants her life back.  As if I'm preventing her from having a life.  Sorry.  Didn't realize paying 75% of my income every month for two rooms in my childhood home which we aren't even allowed to have more than one closet was a problem.  She told me my rent ""was nothing.""

I told her she is unwell.  Just that's it.  ""You are unwell.""

My dad relies on Medicare.  She relies on Medicare.  She is putting off cataract surgery.

I never wish ill on anyone, but she is finally seeing a complementary physical manifestation of her willful blindness to problems and their objective solutions that she rejects by literally going blind if she doesn't get her eyes fixed, and I'm all for consequences.  However, she will blame not getting the surgery on my kids, even though they do literally nothing to her.  My son is the most non-offensive kid you could meet.  He's kind.  He holds doors for people.  A little too kind to strangers (working on that).  He is beloved in school, by other family, and wants nothing but to hang out, cuddle, watch YouTube musical videos about math and elevators, keep trying to learn how to read more words, and to giggle and goof off.  He doesn't throw tantrums.

My daughter has impulse control problems, but it's more along the line of it's gonna take a long time to get her to understand how loud her voice is all of a sudden in an otherwise quiet home.  How vocal stimming play acting emotions is actually quite disruptive at her volume out of nowhere.  She's in her own world if not actively engaged with something super interesting with others.  She means no harm to anyone.  She's usually sitting by herself when it happens.  She's just learning.  It's not great.  There are interventions in place, but they are taking a while to get to, and the cuts are going to make that harder...

I keep my daughter company all day because their IEP places them 13 miles from home.  She is getting alternate placement, and while we wait, I have to just keep her happy while not spending all of my remaining money on gas going to and from school twice a day.

I'm exhausted.  I come home and we've had a good time and it takes a lot more to not be bothered by her shit.  And I'm very sad.

That Congress stuff is ruining  lives.

She just cares about being happy, no matter the cost to us, in what little life she has left, but everyone else is responsible for giving her that happiness.

1o5kuzz,The idea of travelling on business. And their reaction.,"

I brought up the idea of a business trip to them, and it went just how I expected. (they‘re arguing with each other again).

*They* refers to a singular person.

I believe this to be part of my job, though frankly, kind of unnecessary relative to my actual work, because we do just fine working in our time, in a multinational company. The one who asked is my manager (who will also rate my performance), so my view is that saying no is not a good look. My assumption is that everyone will have this experience at some point (though not at the same time).

Do I have particular feelings towards this? I don’t feel much of anything, except that I will not have access to my PC where I do my hobbies. but I do care about what *they* think of the idea.

*They* think this is a sign of a bad workplace because I can’t say no. A particular concern is with lodging and transportation (at this time, it’s too early for an itinerary anyway), and how it’s being scheduled - one or two at a time - so there is a chance I dont have a coworker to go with. I do wish to have a buddy with me to navigate the place and have someone to work with in a new environment, but i think this is ultimately a decision  the higher-ups/business will make.

What I will say is: this is the second time I mentioned this. the first time, I happened to bring up the idea just before I was going to a convention I planned to attend, and the way both of them reacted to it soured the experience.

I am really considering asking to opt out from this, because I am uncomfortable and I’d like to just avoid talking about it. It’s not about the trip at this point.

I barely had any friends, any people to see grown or learn from or evolve.

It was a horrible fight and I was honestly so scared. I haven't been that scared in a long time. I felt like I was being held hostage because she wouldn't let me go anywhere without her while she wanted to rest. 

What scared me the most is she told me to leave the hotel and I packed up my stuff but then when I tried to leave she rushed to me and was saying no please Maddy I love you so much don't leave me, you're my world. Then after all that I still felt I had to apologize. Or else she'd strand me there.

I still feel so confused about it and I really don't know what to do. She's always guilted me to be the best because I'm the oldest but I'm honestly so terrified of her now. It was like walking on eggshells the whole time and never knowing if she was going to snap at me or be nice. I just feel so awful now and its been triggering panic attacks. I keep ruminating on it and blaming myself. Thankfully I live on my own so I'm recovering this week and have my support kitty and self care.

1o5jzeg,Nmom wants me to quit homeschooling my kid,"Before I begin, let me say that I know homeschooling may be triggering for many members of this sub and a big component of their/your NA. Please don’t just jump in to say a big nope based on your experience unless you’ve read the below, thanks.

I have one of those wonderful little guys with a handful of diagnoses. He’s always been a rule-breaker, a boundary-pusher and an out-of-the-box thinker. He has a window of tolerance of roughly 45 minutes. At that point, he goes straight into fight or flight. (Usually fight but occasionally flight and he is FAST.) He struggled so much with preschool that he regressed all the way back to non-verbal so we chose to homeschool him so that he didn’t grow up in an environment where he is branded as a “bad kid” by people who don’t understand his conditions and so that we could ensure all his needs are met, consistently. Seeing other kids with similar additional needs go through the school system and be failed in such a traumatic way has solidified this for us. He would need to go into a mainstream school to prove that they couldn’t meet his needs before a special school would even be available to him.

He’s thriving academically, meeting the same standards as his school peers. He’s accessing socialisation in ways that make him feel like he belongs - through community groups, shared interests and lots of play. He’s meeting people he can actually connect with, that don’t look at him like he’s got five heads. And I feel like I’m doing a good job.

But for my Nmom, he needs to be in a school. And apparently I need him to be in a school. To make my life easier.

I don’t know if it’s specifically about homeschooling or if it’s about me, never being able to do anything right or live up to expectations or provide anything at all to brag about. Or maybe it’s about her. Idk.

I’ve been grey rocking for years (pretty much since my son was born and things kinda exploded Nmom-wise) so I know that I’m already rocking the boat here. But how do I grey rock this? I’ve been getting anxious about the next time it’ll come up because it feels like I’m going to be harassed about it until I give in. (Which I won’t be doing unless either a) the system changes or b) we suddenly become rich enough to send him to a private special school… which is very unlikely.) So yeah, any ideas for how to shut this down forever or is this the natural consequence to my actions that I’ll have to suffer through for the next decade?

1o5jkn2,Engagement Gone Wrong,"My fiancé was going to propose to me, wanted to be honoring to my parents even though he knows they don’t deserve it. 

We went back to there house about 8 hours away with all our friends to give them the chance to be supportive and they were having a complete meltdown. And they would say that I was dodging them while I was home cus I didn’t want to see them. AFTER I DROVE HOURS TO THEIR HOUSE MIND YOU. My friends tried to have a reasonable conversation with them because my mom wanted to pout outside the entire time I was home about how we arent close enough and my now fiancé is evil and controlling and manipulative. How she’s mad that I go to therapy and it’s brainwashing me. 

My friends tried to talk with her for an hour outside to get her to just be normal for a few hours while I came all this way to see her and include her. She couldn’t do it. She attempted to manipulate them and would dismiss everything they said just moving on to another circular reasoning point. My friends pulled me aside after their attempt and said pack your shit we are leaving right now your mom is insane. The relief that someone else gets it now though. I left and went to my friends house, got ready, got engaged.

I decided I was not going to start my marriage with this. My future children will not deal with this or see me in under chaos half the time because I am so effected by their behavior. I need to heal from my C-PTSD and I don’t deserve this. 

About a week after they wouldn’t stop harassing me and would send my family members to message me saying I’m an evil piece of shit that’s abandoned them. I blocked my mom and dad on everything but my other family members still see my stuff.

My parents have indoctrinated nearly my entire small town that I have been brainwashed by my college, therapy, that I’m on anxiety medication that’s messed with my brain, my fiancé is controlling me, and an abundance of other things. 

The fact that none of my family wants anything to do with me now is what stings. I liked some of them. My cousin was nearly my best friend. No one from my home town believes me.

She’ll send me TikToks every day saying the most out of pocket things about black people, about immigrants, about girls who are “asking for it” and deserve to get raped and killed. Btw we are both Salvadorean immigrants, but we came here “the right way” in 2016. 

Her and my grandma (also maga) are my only family though. I have no one else but my boyfriend. Not even friends. 

I want to cut ties so bad cause she is a HORRIBLE person. And I try to justify that she may not be a great person, but she’s been a great mother; however I’ve been thinking about it lately and a good mom would never
1) Forbid me from going outside or to go to the beach because my skin would get dark
2) Tell me I would look better with a nose job
3) Tell me I deserve to get raped based on how I dress
4) Tell me she wishes she’d never given me a chance at education because now I’m indoctrinated, and I’d be better off being illiterate 
5) Tell me she can’t wait for me to get  assaulted by black people so I can “see them for what they really are”

That’s just surface level, but I don’t want to get too into it.

I can’t stand her, honestly. But she’s still all the family I’ve got. We have good conversations about my cats, and clothes. But then she’ll send her daily racist tiktok, with some fucked up text and I don’t want to talk to her anymore.

Have any of you cut out your ONLY family?? My biggest fear is I’ll cut her out, and then absolutely regret it when she dies. But she’s so full of hatred I’m tired of hearing it every day.

1o5ihee,"Not free, but something close. Stepfather finally found out, and karma aimed true.","I'm new here, and despite reading your rules I am unfamiliar with your customs so I may make mistakes. I am marking this as NSFW just in case. This post may be triggering. Please note that I have no intention of harm, but am unsure as to what is too much to share. I ask only for patience and understanding as this is one of very few times I have related this whole sordid affair, that has come to thankfully a happy near-conclusion.

I (35M) am the eldest of four. Our folks split up when I was about 5 and my younger sister was 2 or 3. Our bio-dad was military and had been constantly cheating on her when deployed, leading to the divorce.

My mom got custody and it was pretty tough for a while until she found someone new. He was a long-haired pizza delivery boy from Georgia. We weren't the easiest kids to love but He did His best with how He was raised at the time, I think.

We moved south a couple years later because He had family out there, and cost of living was much cheaper than where we were at the time. Got a house, and my mom had my little brother 3 years after that, and my little sister another 3 years later. Growing up and becoming more cognizant of how He treated us, though, it was abusive.

Beyond just corporal punishment (which was par for the course in the 90s), He belittled us at every turn and He could just look at you with this pure disdain that made you feel like fucking scum for just existing. I distinctly remember Him crashing out, screaming and jumping around me like a madman because I was struggling with math homework. There was another time when I was about 12 when He took me aside and very calmly explained that from now on if I had to be spanked, it'd be with a belt because He was tired of hurting His hand. It became such that my sister and I were genuinely afraid to wake Him up for breakfast to avoid his wrath. 

He didn't beat us every day, indeed what corporal punishment there was, was for genuine fuckups, so only about twice a month on average. There weren't any bruises, and the one time He did leave bruises, the school noticed and CPS was called. We were given the spiel by Him and Mom that they were trying to take our father away, and I was too dumb to realize that may have been better. Adding to this, the reason FOR the bruises was that I was hanging out in the middle of a Lowe's aisle and daydreaming like the dumb kid I was, and another shopper was heading right for me, also not paying attention, so he grabbed me by the shoulder and yanked me out of the way. So, I didn't have negative feelings towards THOSE marks at that time (I bruise like a peach, after all, thank you skinny pale boy genes). CPS found me uncooperative as a result, and He was only ordered to do an anger management course. The psychological abuse, on the other hand, was daily and has left an ever-present scar. To this day I still hear ""You don't care about anyone but yourself"" in my head when I fuck up. The long and short of all of this is that early on I developed a habit of lying to avoid punishment, which rarely worked because I was a dumb kid and He was pretty sharp, but the scared animal in me still tried. That has taken me a long, LONG time to break, and only happened when I joined a competitive gaming group that would harp on me hard for fuckups but only briefly and then it was as if it had never happened. On the other hand, anyone who LIED was immediately and permanently thrown out.

Conversely, He showered my younger brother and youngest sister with affection, and blamed us for any of their fuckups. We were very much made to feel like ""Not HIS kids."" At one point He had purchased an ATV and was teaching my little bro to ride it. He took me aside afterwards and asked if I was angry. I told Him no, which was true. He said ""Good, because your brother and sister are going to have more opportunities and I don't want you to feel any resentment toward them."" I didn't quite understand at the time what He meant. I was too cowed to realize that He knew He was shoving us aside. But no, to this day I hold absolutely no resentment towards any of my siblings. They're lovely people, one and all. I will always and forever resent Him for making our lives a living hell. Financial stability wasn't worth this.

Fast-forward, I'm 20. I get into an argument with my folks over an invasion of privacy on a phone I paid for. Mom tries to justify it, I tell my mom to go to hell. Stepfather grabs me by the ponytail, throws me off the porch, tells me to get out.

Fast forward. I'm in a better spot. While I'm not NC with my Mom, her, my siblings, and I become estranged for a while. Some years later I get a call. They're vacationing out there, going to a theme park, and ask if I want to go with and visit. At this point it had been long enough that I had mostly pushed down the feelings from my childhood, and I didn't want to fully alienate anyone save my stepfather. I said sure. The trip was mostly uneventful, and a family friend who had been like a sister to my Mom was also there so His Vileness was on good behaviour I supposed. Mom calls me outside to come hang out with them while they smoked and carped, and I am very much a gossip girl at heart so yeah sure why not, especially since He's not out there. They then tell me the reason He'd been acting so slapped: He cheated on my mom. Not only that, but He brought the woman home and tried to convince my Mother into being okay with it.

So the fallout from THAT was that He found out that all the people He thought were His friends ended up really being my mother's friends (she is very much a social butterfly and she can easily and happily talk your ear off for 6 fucking hours if you let her) and mostly just tolerated Him. Turns out people pick up on cruelty even if you put on a pretty public face. She received not a few offers to have Him buried where nobody would find Him. She took him back ""until your siblings are moved out"" for the sake of family stability and I believe not wanting to be lonely as she grew older. She also mentioned that this wouldn't ever happen again, and that one of the conditions for her taking Him back was that He was to sober the fuck up (He had been slipping into alcoholism) and give her control of the family finances. I didn't like it, but I understood. We departed on a high note and resolved to not be such strangers.

Fast-forward. My youngest sibling is getting married to actually a great guy as it turned out. She asks if I can be there. I happily answer yes. Everything goes well for the most part. My siblings have grown into wonderful men and women with a firm grasp on the reality of their situation. I have a minor freak-out when I catch Him staring at me with that same disdain from when I was a kid. I excuse myself to go partake of nicotine and quiet despair, and the bastard follows me. He asks if anything's wrong, laughs, and leaves. He later finds out that my youngest sibling had no plans for having Him walk her down the aisle, and instead gave the honor to a family friend. He acts like a kicked dog for the rest of the night, and leaves early, the miserable fuck.

Fast-forward to just recently. I get a call just to catch up on things, and oh man there's a lot. My mom is out of the house, staying with a family friend until they move out of the country, upon which time she intends to move in with her son-in-law's mom who needs a caretaker. This is all agreed upon and kosher, so no worries there. She tells me that all the shit going on politically has served to further drive Him nuts, and He being the narcissist He is, constantly picks fights with her (to which she refuses to engage). She is very much a liberal hippy type and has been all her life, while he is now a hardcore MAGAt (go figure). With the public slaying of one particular demagogue, He picks another argument about something stupid like how we're all dangerous lunatics who thrive on violence. Again she refuses to engage, but instead of backing down, He only gets further incensed. He tells her to get the fuck out. Normally she just retreats to a hotel for a night until he calms down, but not this time. She has left for good and all, and more power to her. She is financially stable, and has a plan.

He is alone. Will die alone and unloved. His other immediate family has been mostly disgraced or estranged by His own behaviour. If He had any honor left He would do something appropriate about it, but He doesn't, so He won't. The only thing I learned from Him is a little self-control and an adamantine resolve to break the cycle of abuse, and I couldn't be happier.",Zerachiel_01,1760358929.0,9,0.92,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o5ihee/not_free_but_something_close_stepfather_finally/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o5ihee/not_free_but_something_close_stepfather_finally/,raisedbynarcissists,True,True,False,False,False,,False

1o5hnwj,I'm so happy I found out early,"I'm 15 and found out my dad is a narcissist a year ago. I'm still so glad I did because my entire childhood was managing the relationship dynamics of my mother and father, always being hypervigilant and carefully examining every micro expression and tone of voice. I would behave in a very extroverted way just to keep both parents happy and if they would fight (which would happen regularly), I'd be the one who would sort them out. After an overall severe fight with me and my father, I've began grey-rocking him and learning about his behavior a year ago. 

I realized he was a narcissist. He would never take the blame, always act like a victim, have shockingly low empathy (Not kidding- One time he said some severely nasty things with blood fueled eyes and rage I'm not quite sure I can say here and a second, literally a second later, his friend called him and he was laughing and joking with him like nothing happened). A day after a violent fight with my mother, he'd forget everything and be all happy and laughing. I remember when he told me that he promised in the name of God that he was the greatest, strongest and wisest man in the world for dealing with my mother and if I found out all the miraculous and great things he 'endured' then I'd worship him till my death. There was no physical violence thankfully, but there was quite alot of emotional stress and abuse.

I see stories of other people with narcissistic parents who found out in their 30s or 40s or much later. My heart goes out for them and I feel strong compassion for them as I relate to their story. But I can't help but feel grateful for realizing his patterns at this early age as I feel much more mental energy, more calm and more focus in things I love doing. I'm no longer hearing his previously endless and frequent drama, complaints and rants (grey rocking and minimal interaction helped alot). It's not all good, there are still quite alot of problems living with him and I'd truly flourish once I stop living with him and go no contact but that's not an option right now. So that's my story.

1o5hl7z,I’m out. I’ve never felt better,"I posted a little while back unsure if I should move out but after talking to a few people I did. I’m out and live with my grandmother now. I cried the first day here because I felt so loved. I’ll go over the good then how my mom reacted

The good:

I only got “in trouble” once here. My grandma stopped me to have a talk and told me I need to stop worrying because I won’t upset her and she isn’t mad at me. It’s been fantastic 

I get my medication easy, I have food, I’m able to leave my room, I can use the bathroom at night with the light on and door locked, I can get snacks at night (my nana moved my snacks from the garage to the kitchen fridge for easier access at night too), I get hugs and told I’m loved (my mom refused to hug me, only my sister and brother, and told me to stop saying I love you since I said it too much), my grandma talks to me whenever I’m outside my room, and we hangout and eat together

I fell getting out of the shower and my grandma said that she can heat me up some stew if I wanted so I can rest. My mom hasn’t made me food since I was probably 10. 

I played video games online with my friends and when I walked out I wasn’t scolded for making noise. She said it was nice to hear me laughing and happy

My mom’s reaction: 
She was fine and handled it well… originally. She said my grandma was trying to kill us all and to watch out but other than that it was fine.. she even said I could take my time moving out and had a few weeks…. That lasted a day lmao. 

The day after we got my furniture out and I stayed over at my grandmas officially for the first night my mom called around 1pm. She said I trashed the house and fucked her over and fucking ruined her and I had til the end of the day to get my stuff or she’d put it outside. She had woken me up from a quick nap so I sat there zoning out while she cussed me out and then hung up on her for the first time ever.

She texted saying I don’t get to hangup on her so I said I was too stressed out to be talked to like that. 

Fun fact: my old house is an hour away and my grandma doesn’t like to drive at night. So I had to get all of my stuff before 6pm and arrived around 2:30. We had to make multiple trips to get everything too. 

Thankfully my grandmas boyfriend lives 20 minutes away from my old house so he told us to stack my stuff there and just grab a load of stuff everytime we were on the side of town and he’d bring the rest when he came down next. 

Anyways- I showed up at the house to get the stuff and thought maybe there was a break in since I didn’t trash it but I walked in and it was clean. There were boxes in my room and living room, stuff on the counter, and dust in my room. That was it. I took pictures and was baffled honestly. 

My mom called the next day and pretended nothing happened BUT she admitted the mold in my room was a health hazard and she couldn’t sell the house like that. I slept next to mold that I had asked her to fix 6 years ago and got nightly nose bleeds from the last year but she didn’t care since it didn’t affect her. But she admitted it was bad and dangerous for once. 

That’s about all so far. I don’t have any crazy rules or chores and I don’t get insulted or cussed out. I finally got my insurance sorted out as well. My only regret is I should’ve left sooner

so i took his rubicks cube infront of him and demanded he apologizes or else i wont give it back, he's half my age but i guess he needs to learn that he cant just take other people's stuff without asking and even break them? he broke my rubicks cube too and it wasnt the cheap 3$ one you'd find.

anyways he starts screaming as high as he can im sure that shi was like 70+ decibles my ears were dead, my dad comes back from work the moment this happens and tells us both to get out for a sweet 45 mins or so, my little brother and me, yes im 14 and he's only fucking 7. 

at least ground me not him, its above 35 celcius and he only has his goddamn boxers on (yes boxers only) 

and this is just an example he kicked me out 2 days ago for something that was so small i dont even remember it rn. 

i dont even know what to do anymore this feels stupid.

my brother was also crying most of the time he was outside, and my dad always has a stupid rule that when he says ""silence"" if you talk youre grounded a bad grounding, he would make my brother stand next to the wall for like 30 with both hands raised up, my brother sometimes doesnt listen and its fine he's a kid but my dad thinks he needs to be disciplend this way which is dumb ngl.

1o5f729,mother saying she misses me,"Hi guys, this is the first time I’m positing something here and I would really appreciate your advice or experiences. I (24F) was kicked out of home last year by my psycho brother (30) and my mom (52). I was physically, verbally and mentally abused my whole life. This year I got my diagnosis: CPTSD. Anyways, fast forward. I went no contact almost 2 months ago and I talked to a friend of my mom because I needed help with some papers because she speaks the language and I don’t. My mom is apparently telling everyone how much she misses me and that I blocked her and taking her friends phones and watching if I go online on WhatsApp and if I blocked any of them. She is crying and victimizing herself infront of her friends and telling them a wrong story. She said I moved out on my own and she is keeping that lie alive. I didn’t even bother telling the truth because I don’t care at this point. The thing is, why does she do this? What does she gain from it? I am finally accepting the truth that I really do NOT like my mom and that’s okay. She never showed me love but in front of friends and family she is acting like she is lost without me. Did any of your parents do this? I do feel sad now because my moms friend told me on the phone that she visited my mom and they were cleaning her apartment and she didn’t want to throw away anything I gifted her because it reminds her of me and she apparently loves my gifts but guess who ripped all of the pictures of us together off in my room not even one month after getting kicked out. I really don’t know what to think. I am so mad that she is making me out to be the villain and telling all these lies to people. I don’t care about people but I want her to stop putting my name into her mouth and victimizing herself. She has 4 other children, she will be alright. Any advice ?

1o5ewkz,I feel like this whole disability thing my mum created was a trap,"I feel like this whole disability thing my mum created was a trap. Growing up, I was never just “windblownorb” I was “the autistic kid.” I was never “my sisters brother” I was “my sisters autistic brother”. My mum always told everyone I was “her autistic son”. Not her son.

I never got to do anything unattended growing up. Like I never got to go to the mall with my friends as a teen or do anything independently. I always had a parent or caregiver. I never left the house by myself until I was 18 and it was a walk to the supermarket and back. My mum did driving practise lessons with both my sisters but almost never drove with me. When we put the intervention order on my abusive father, she stopped driving with me completely. I pay for lessons but I can’t drive a lot.

I used to have a habit coach making me more independent when I turned 19. She taught me how to use public transport. She was very kind but there was a misunderstanding between her and my mum where my habit coach thought my mum was speaking to my abusive dad, and this caused my mum to flip out. She started saying to me that Mikayla wasn’t trustworthy, that she purposely lying, she was on my dads side, and I need to get rid of her. My occupational therapist (boss of habit coach) defended my habit coach, and this made my mum really angry and she told my OT my habit coach was a “bitch” who “better not come near my son.” This made my OT cry because my habit coach loved my mum and I. I told my mum I wanted to keep seeing her and my got really upset. My mum kept sending my habit coach abusive messages the whole time, and started calling her company about the time I went in her car to get her in trouble. Then my habit coach stopped seeing me because the crap from my mum was becoming too much. Then my mum told me that she was “writing her uni thesis on our family” and “was gonna make me go to a group home where I’m going to be tortured.” Despite no evidence she ever said this.

I still see the same OT but she never came to my house again. Mum told me last year stuff like I shouldn’t go to TAFE anymore, I shouldn’t do driving lessons anymore, that my habit coach shouldn’t have taught me how to use public transport, and that I shouldn’t be friends with my best friend that has been extremely supportive because she listens to metal music. She also kept trying to control what I do with my NDIS funding. And got really upset when I took her off as my nominee. (She doesn’t know it was me who took her off.) She tried to convince me I need her to manage what I do with my NDIS.

More recently, I started setting boundaries with her and I found all these emails on her phone to my counsellor, teacher and support team about how I’ve become crazy, aggressive, and she also became emotionally abusive towards me almost every day. I snapped and had a meltdown where I almost smashed something and apologised, and she called the mental health triage that “I tried to hurt her” and “I have thoughts of hurting her and my sister” to get me SECTIONED. A few weeks later I s*lf h*rmed and then she called the mental health triage that I was “stomping around the house with a knife” and sent all these smear emails and text telling my support team the same lies she told the mental health triage. And one wrote lies like I can’t look after myself, that she takes me to all my appointments, (I take myself to most) that she cooks meals for me (I am responsible for my own breakfast and lunch and only eat family dinners.) She lies about me “refusing help and medication” when I’ve never done that. She said I “lie profoundly which stops the mental health team from stepping in” when I’m actually telling the mental health team the TRUTH so they don’t section me. She made me out to be this horrible dangerous aggressive disabled person who can’t look after himself when that couldn’t be further from the truth. She constantly speaks down to me and has become extremely rude and cruel to me. And every time I call her out she denies what she did and tells me she has no idea what I’m talking about.

And I go to disability disco, go with support workers, go to TAFE for people with disabilities, and I’m happy I get all this support but I’m starting to feel like this whole disability thing was a trap by my mum. Like to convince me and the people around me I’m too disabled to look after myself, like look at all this disability stuff I do! She always talks about how everyone is untrustworthy except for her and my older sister who agrees with her on everything. And I’ve been too focused on trying to prove my disability was valid, my feelings are valid, my support needs are valid, to realise the trap she was setting up. The trap that I’m an extremely disabled high support needs autistic man who will never be independent, and will always rely on her.

And it’s made me re evaluate certain things she’s said. Like one time, when we were talking about levels I said I think I’m level 1, she said “you’re actually level 2.” She said after she passes my older sister will be my carer. I said I didn’t want a carer. She said “you need a carer windblownorb”. She gets to be seen as a person who happens to be autistic, while I get seen as a disabled problem to be managed before I’m seen as a person. It makes me feel trapped, like I can’t manage my own adult life when I’ve been working so hard to be independent and responsible.

I just want to be treated like a human being, and instead I cop all this crap even tho I have severe CPTSD. And I’ve developed chest pain costochondritis after this. Probably from all the trauma.

I remember she also once said to me, “I’m your legal carer” even tho she isn’t, she just gets a carers pension which is valid in financial term only. Also I’m seeing a new therapist cuz my current one has been talking to my mum and constantly defends her.

I sent a long email explaining the truth to my OT and have an appointment with her on Friday. She is one of the people my mum smeared me to but she is likely to believe me due to history and what happened with my habit coach. I just wrote all this cuz I feel trapped.",windblownorb,1760347109.0,11,0.93,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o5ewkz/i_feel_like_this_whole_disability_thing_my_mum/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o5ewkz/i_feel_like_this_whole_disability_thing_my_mum/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o5eoo0,I feel like I'll never get out of here,"20F, soon to be 21 and living with my mom whom I do not have a great relationship. And I don't have the resources to change my living situation. I never graduated highschool and I don't have a driver's license or even an ID. I have a good amount of money saved up in my college fund, around 50k but I don't have access to it. My mom is my legal guardian and has control over my finances and stuff. I feel really dumb because I just don't understand. I don't know what I can even do about this. I don't have any friends and all of my family lives out of state, plus they're closer with my mom than they are me so I think reaching out to them would do more harm than good. I feel really hopeless and like so so stupid. Like I don't even know how to be a functioning adult, I still feel like a kid. I just don't know what to do. I don't think I can do anything without my mom's help but when I've asked for help with gaining independence it's like she brushes it off. She's never told me no, but it's like she says okay but not really. She won't talk about it with me right then because she's busy. Sometimes I feel like it would be easier to die than to get out and I think about suicide a lot. I have Major Depressive Disorder and severe anxiety and I'm not medicated. I've attempted before, when I was 13 and I started home schooling because of it, and I never went back to a physical school so that's why I don't have any friends or connections which makes escaping harder because I have no support system or anyone local to me that can help me.

1o5dncx,Experience with restoring contact with siblings after triangulation?,"I did it. I just sent an email to my brother. Haven't had contact in years. I was so mad at him for not contacting me whilst I have cancer and will probably die from it.

And then it hit me. What did my mother tell him? I asked her not to provide my brothers with medical information, because at least half of what she says is false. And because we have this system where every time communication goes through her or with her in the room.

But I know she always tells me bad things about him when he is not around. Criticizes him and his wife, tells me they are mad at me for something I did as a teen. And stupid me never thought of confronting him with this. She might have told him I didn't want any contact at all. And by doing that, totally alienated me from my brothers. So she could save me, be there for me, feel like the most important person in my life.

Suddenly I realised he probably is a victim as well. So I reached out. Not blaming him in any way, just asking him - what do you know about me and who told you that.

I hope I get a reaction from him. But I am really curious te hear from others. Has anybody been able to restore a relationship after a Nperson succesfully destroyed it? What did it take?

1o5c4z0,Narc mum (52) shaded me (F23) on her TikTok live,"My mum and I have not seen each other in the last 6 years after I ran away at the age of 17. I only got back into contact with my family about a year ago after being encouraged to do so by family and friends (even though I did not care for it). 

It's done me some good, especially since I live abroad now and choose when to reach out and what to respond to. Well—my narc mother (unsurprisingly) has not changed, and recently, we both had a falling out again. 

For context on our falling out: we had an argument over the phone when she brought up my brother (the golden child—spoiled, unemployed, past the age of 30 and does nothing but stay at home) being sick (not seriously, just a cold). She told me he had stopped smoking or drinking alcohol while sick. I had said ""oh well, that's not gonna hurt him,"" as a joke and laughed (he smokes and drinks everyday, and my parents fund it) and she proceeded to tell me how I had zero empathy and how that would make me a terrible psychologist (I'm a third year student). I proceeded to call her out on how what I said and my future profession doesn't correlate. She then continued to say ""that's the difference between you and your brother—he stayed and you left,"" and I told her, ""It's not like you were beating him too though, was it?"". Hearing this, she flipped her shit and started saying how I should be ""understanding as a psychologist"" because she was being ""abused by my father"" (a lie). I just laughed and said, ""So does that mean you abuse your children too?"" After this, she prattled on and on, so I just hung up because, hey, I have free will, and it's not like she can beat me now, lol. 

She sent me a very long message after that about how she will cut me off lol and that she ""hopes I will find it in my heart to forgive her."" (No apologies, of course). 

Moving onto TikTok, my friend called today to let me know that my mum was on live at 4AM and talking to her followers. Someone asked about her children, and she said she only had two sons. My friend asked, ""What about Hentai?"" And she told everyone that ever since moving abroad the money and lifestyle had gotten to my head 😂 (I'm a broke international student on a scholarship that covers only my tuition and support myself by working my ass off at THREE jobs...). She's asked me multiple times to send her money, but I've refused and expressed this, but it goes in one ear out the other. They've also stolen 10k from me in the past that was meant for my studies that was given by the government, but they chose to pocket it. 

She's also made posts in the past about me on her page. She even chose to study counseling this year just because I'm studying psychology (she would never admit that of course) and got my enabler father to fund it (when they refused to sponsor my university within my home country). 

Crazy woman.

1o5bwg1,My mom got divorced and now is asking for an insane payout we can't afford,"I’m just so lost right now. I feel completely done with everything.

My mom has been a nightmare for most of my life. She’s always hated my dad and his parents, and that hate has never really stopped.

Last year, she filed for divorce. My dad literally had no choice but to sign the papers because otherwise, it would go to court and just drag out even more. So he signed, and that was it. They were divorced.

Now she’s saying she never really wanted the divorce, that she just wanted him to “talk to her.” Like… what?? Who files for divorce just to get someone’s attention? That’s such a manipulative, narcissistic thing to do. And now she’s blaming him for it, as if she didn’t start the whole thing.

After the divorce, she moved back to her parents’ property but bought herself a trailer (while she was still married). And now she’s demanding a €100,000 payout from my dad and his parents, because she says they “never treated her well.” Which is true, my grandparents are horrible, but my dad always treated her well, just didn't stood up against his parents - which is bothering her a lot and I can understand that.

And it's not even a whole house, they built like an extension to my grandparents' house and my parents just got the ownership of the land that this extension is placed on, the rest is still owned by my grandparents. 

There’s no way they can come up with that kind of money unless they sell the house and everything they own. But my dad is taking care of his old and sick parents, where is he supposed to go? She doesn’t care. She just wants her revenge.

She doesn’t understand that if that happens, it’s me and my brother who will have to deal with the consequences. We’ll be the ones carrying that burden. Even if we don't live there anymore we will have to help our dad to be able to live. 

And honestly, I do get it to some extent. She’s trying to get back at my grandparents for not treating her well. But at some point, she has to let it go. They don’t have much time left. Karma will come for them anyway, she doesn’t need to destroy everyone else in the process. But when I tried explaining that to ger she just gets defensive.

With the money my dad could offer her, she could easily buy a small apartment in our city and have a stable life. But she doesn’t want stability, she wants control.

The lawyer costs are already insane, and if this goes to court, it’ll be even worse. My dad was supposed to retire next month, but now he can’t because he needs the money for this. He even took a bank loan already.

I’ve tried talking to her, being nice, reasoning, begging. It’s like talking to a wall.

My dad is completely broken.
And so am I.

I don’t even know what to do anymore.

1o5bcc9,Emotional incest: What motivates an adult to seek emotional support from a child,"i was my nmoms divorce and relationship emotional offload from around age 14. when my sister was diagnosed with bipolar and schizphrinia, my nmom came to me and when my nmom fell out with my sister once she got medicated. Any family problems or anything going wrong in my nmoms life (which was seemingly everything as a fundamentally unlikable narcissist), it was given to me to reason about and consult and give my opinion of. Even going back to my nmoms childhood, she would raise things and offload them to me to help her process her own trauma, which she would never take accountability of as a victim playing narc. i never got to voice my own problems or concerns (despite seeing my sister get hospitalized and psychotic, she just cared about herself). my expression was not allowed.

Essentially, my nmom put all the adult problems of a 40+ year old onto a child. it felt like i was helping her and that we had a special type of bond. It hurt me and i felt sad to hear how hard my nmom had it, I would cry, and often i would take her side and feel to blame. Eventually I became numb, and I would no longer cry, just zone out. She would call me ""the man of the house"" - and expect me to do jobs around the house. They didn't feel like normal chores to help me learn life skills you would give a teenager, they felt like I was taking on her responsibilies and doing jobs for her like a spouse would. She would mix it in with abuse, insults, guilt tripping me. She would offload her emotions while simultaneously saying cruel and nasty things to me.

1o5ajs0,She still screams at me every day because I “don’t have a real job.”,"I’m 21 and still living with my parents. My mom has been abusive for as long as I can remember — not just emotionally, but physically too, especially throughout my childhood. I thought things would get better once I grew up, once I finished my degree, but it’s just the same cycle all over again. I’m freelancing right now because the job market here is horrible. I work late nights since most of my clients are in different time zones. I’ve explained this to my mom so many times, but she doesn’t care. She’s an early morning person and thinks anyone who doesn’t wake up at 6 a.m. is lazy. So she tries to wake me up every morning no matter how late I worked, screaming that I’m useless and doing nothing with my life. She doesn’t believe I actually work. According to her, only people who go to an office have “real jobs.” She’ll barge into my room while I’m working, yell about how I’m wasting my time, and make me feel like complete garbage. It’s nonstop — the yelling, the judgment, the constant need to make me feel small. My dad never gets to say anything. She completely shuts him down whenever he tries to talk or intervene. It’s like her word is law, and everyone else just has to live by it. I can’t move out yet because rent is insane and my freelance income is still unstable. But every day feels suffocating. I’m trying to build something for myself, but it feels impossible when the person who’s supposed to support you just tears you down instead. I just needed to vent. I’m exhausted — mentally, emotionally, physically. It hurts so much to be doing my best and still be treated like I’m nothing.

1o5aje0,“Can I say something without you getting offended?” | Vent about NMom during alcohol recovery,"Edit: I am 23 F, living at home with Nmom and enabler Dad, and an older brother who is basically blind to it all. I believe he is partially on the spectrum however so I do not blame him at all. He is not the problem and how mom treats him is a whole other can of worms.

“Can I say something without you getting offended?” Is the most annoying, ragebaity thing you can say to a person out of the blue and only makes things 100x worse because it’s condescending as hell. For one, why are you even asking? You’re going to say what you’re going to say anyway (to make yourself feel better while putting down the other person). You’re already assuming they’ll get mad because of what you’re going to say and this is more a failure on your part because why am I already doing something wrong and you haven’t even said anything yet. 

Please shut the fuck up and learn how to communicate properly—Mom, this is about you. I’m not saying you can’t tell me how you feel. But 0% of the time do you think about choice of words and how they’ll make me feel, you only do that when it’s to your benefit and it’s always blinded by what YOU want and think. What you feel like you deserve from me.  I would’ve been fine and not immediately been set off with anxiety through the roof if you didn’t do this. You literally could’ve said ANYTHING else. Like, “I’m going to say something, and it might be a little upsetting to hear” or “I’m going to say something but I don’t want you to take it the wrong way (not perfect but better), or “I’m going to ask something that might be a little unfair” (she would never deign to say that though). 

For context I have depression and have been taking Zoloft for a couple months which has noticeably made me feel quite exhausted and fatigued throughout the day so I nap more frequently. She randomly asked me while I was heating up soup if they stopped filling up my pills for some reason because I’ve been acting “different” and “used to be so much happier,” I’m spending too much time in my room, etc. You do not understand how angry this made me and her having said the “can I say something without you getting upset” bit really threw me off. I’m sorry but is that not insane?? I’m not in a 100% peachy mood around you all the time and that means I’m not taking my pills? For one I would never describe myself as a “happy” person and her basically telling me to my face that I’ve somehow gotten worse (for her) was really fucking triggering. I’m sober from alcohol 90 days yesterday. Alcohol made me happy which is why I had such a problem with it, now that I’m sober it’s just rough reality all the time. But she takes it personally that I’m not always in a good mood. Like me not being extroverted and loving spending time with her is so unacceptable because she’s a perfect mother and deserves that from me. Piss off. Yes I feel irritable a lot but I think that’s natural cause of my situation with alcohol and considering she’s a narcissist and can’t deal with situations that don’t go her way. Also I’ve always preferred my room to anywhere else in the house because it’s the one place I can actually relax and not be on edge because I’m going to get bombarded with some bs like this (Even though she’ll come knocking if she wants, so is it really a safe space?). ALWAYS. And somehow that’s wrong. Like hm I wonder WHY I like my room so much. Can you use your one non-self centered brain cell for just a second and think? Yes I would rather be alone than talk to you 100% of the time. That’s normal me that doesn’t mean anything. No fucking pill is going to make me like talking to you and force myself to do it bitch. I’m sorry but I need to vent because living here and having her as a mom can be so fucking ridiculous. 

Before this she had already been convinced that I must be missing my counseling appointments. Not even true by a long shot. She assumes the worst with me. All the time. No bitch, you just don’t care to pay enough attention to know that I actually was going. I go 3x a week for group and an individual session at a place 20 minutes away, so she can’t even notice when I’m gone for like 2 hours?? Just assumes. At what point does it start to feel malicious? I had missed two groups within the first couple weeks (it’s an eight week program and I’m near the end), one because I wasn’t feeling well (stomach issues, oversleeping) and the other because my dumb ass decided to get three shots the day before and could barely move when I woke up the next day. I would get it if she said something then, but she chooses to say something now when I’ve actually committed myself and it just feels so unfair. I will never be able to do anything right with her or be enough just as I am. 

Icing on the cake w/ all this bullshit she says/said. After I was so flabbergasted and had to calm myself down before responding to her, that the zoloft was making me tired, she had to say “see? It wasn’t that hard/ I don’t know what’s so hard about that”. It was the second time she’s said that. AGAIN YOURE TRYING TO MAKE ME THE ONE IN THE WRONG/THE BAD GUY. Because I don’t love talking to you. IM always the one that’s “not communicating well” and she’s never done anything wrong in that regard. Bull fucking shit we’ve always had little communication and unhealthy communication in this house you can’t just pin that all on me. Like actually suck my left nut Donna. 

Having my 78 y.o. Dad call me (he barely ever uses his phone let alone calls) to tell me to come home to help my mom in the garden (do hard labor for god knows how long) as SOON AS I finally leave the house to do errands today is another thing that enraged me. I came out of Walgreens when I saw that he called and texted. I just. Fucking. Left. Are you going to disown me, kick me out if I don’t come rushing back right away because you said so?? I’m 23 years old and she treats me like this inanimate robot that she can order around whenever she feels like and with 0 notice. Like she could’ve said at SOME POINT the days prior that she was going to have us help today but she didn’t. What if I was doing something important. She probably wouldn’t care. I’m sorry but I absolutely did not rush myself to get back and I’m not going to feel guilty for that. After the pharmacy I went to the dollar store for some lint rollers and miscellaneous stuff, then went to Aldi’s to get some milk because we were low, which I was now seriously not considering doing because it was something to be nice and what’ll be the point of that if when I get home and go outside to do this forced labor that she’ll already be upset with me because I didn’t come outside quick enough, and I don’t want to do good or nice things for people who are assholes. That would just make me feel silly. Also a dumb thing about these situations is that after the fact she’ll be all fake like “thank you, I really appreciate it.” Bitch I had no choice? You would be irate and probably verbally abuse me if I didn’t do everything you say, right as you want it done?? Insane. I feel like it’s saying something if your child is happy at the thought of no contact eventually being an option (not saying that’s what I’m going to do, but if your kid says they would 100% be happier if they never had to speak to you again then that’s concerning. I know for a fact I would be).

Anyway, that’s my life of recent. Thanks for reading and I would appreciate any comments or advice 💕

1o5adlo,"Sooooo, my NMom is furious because ...","... I have a legitimate health condition which saw me admitted to hospital for a five night stay (quite a big deal in a country where patch and dispatch is their motto), and her ""health issue"" is a big nothingburger.

NMom is a hypochondriac.  Always has been.  As soon as the attention is off her, she creates health emergencies.  She's been going on about pain in her lower abdomen for quite some time.  She had one scan that was inconclusive, so went for another one today that doesn't show anything.  The advice she's been given is to monitor symptoms and return to her doctor if things worsen.

She is furious.  She said she thinks she should talk to my doctor, as she knows there is something wrong that her doctor and the imaging center aren't detecting (eyeroll).  Meanwhile, she HATES it that I am heading back to hospital tomorrow because some results I received over the weekend (subsequent to my discharge) are a bit of a worry to the consultant leading my healthcare so we're going to have a chat.  She seems to be living vacariously through what I'm telling her in relation to me, thinking it's her (my cousin called and expressed concern about my mom having to go into hospital to get some bad news) ... she's old and quite possibly losing the plot, but it's very very strange.

When she came in to visit me in the hospital I could hardly talk because I had a tube down my throat.  Plus, I was feeling rotten and asked please don't come, which of course she ignored that.  She was a right nuisance, getting in the way of the nurses who were administering IV drugs ... it's as if she really doesn't get it that the world does not revolve around her.

1o5a2e6,"My dad cosplayed so well as a boundaried adult today, I nearly apologized and thought I was the crazy one.","Dad got fired a month or so ago and has suddenly been trying to make plans with me now that he has nothing but free time. He and my aunt (whom I'm much closer with) have also fallen out and he's going to try to take the house my late grandmother left the two of them 50/50. I feel in part, his interest in spending time with me is to put me in the middle and try to get me on his side. 

I agreed to go on a motorcycle ride with him this morning, even though I don't feel safe spending one on one time with him. But he totally flaked out and has done so several times now. 

I got a wild hair and decided to call it out instead of letting it slide, letting him know my time was limited, I took plans seriously, and I didn't appreciate being an afterthought. 

His response was pretty standard for how he's always treated me- saying everything was always my way and on my time and he didn't think the responsibility was on him. That his time was valuable, too. I started to question whether I had a leg to stand on. But on the other side, I had already stood up for myself and was ready to burn it all to the ground. I did neither and didn't respond.

1o59ndz,How can I stop hoping that my nmom changes?,"A few days ago, I was reading a web comic and I saw a part where the MC's father comes back and even when a huge part of the MC's trauma comes from him, she keeps a little hope of her dad making things different this time. That made me be more conscious about me acting that way with my nmom.
Despite a few weeks ago that I told her that I didn't want to have to interact with her (something that made her make a pity party with my family about me being selfish and cruel with her and costed me the relationship with two of my siblings and finally made a change in our house's dynamic) I found myself waiting that this event made her think about how has she been as a mother, a lot of times in a day. 
Today, for example, we met my sister and she made a joke about my mom putting her in an uncomfortable situation when she was little, and my mom told her that lately she was thinking about things that my sister had to bear with and that my mom thought they were okay because my sister never talked things with her and that things could be different if my (child at that moment) sister told her how she was feeling. Later she tried to talk to me about what I was watching and I showed the first chapter, where there's a strange mother-daughter relationship and I secretly hoped that reminded her of some motherly love or care, but at the end she criticized  the MC's mom for her decisions and I felt like she lost the point that I was trying to convey by showing her the scene that really resonated with me.
It's really stupid that I hope to see a tiny bit of remorse or understanding in her, only finding myself more disappointed on her but still trying or searching  an aperture on her.",MarSaladx,1760328016.0,1,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o59ndz/how_can_i_stop_hoping_that_my_nmom_changes/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o59ndz/how_can_i_stop_hoping_that_my_nmom_changes/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o59d53,My mom uses me instead of a therapist,"I (23F) moved back in with my parents this year after graduating college. College was not perfect but at least okay for me in terms of my relationship with my mom, and I was happy to move back for a few months while I sorted out my medical needs and looked for a job. But our relationship has quickly deteriorated again and therapy + medication is what's keeping me from completely losing it. Especially now that I'm unpacking it in therapy a lot of trauma from the past is being brought back to the surface. 

  
My mom has been confiding in me and using me as a therapist to talk about her problems, particularly her problems with my dad and their marriage and her own family since I was around 12. From the get go I knew there was something off about this, but I didn't have the capacity to understand it or my mom's condition yet. The amount of physical distance between us made this muted while I was in college, but now it's gotten arguably even worse because my parent's relationship has gotten worse and she's able to justify dumping all of this on me because I'm an adult now. Every day I have to hear her complain about my dad, about her siblings (who to be fair are also a huge mess, but that's another story), getting the play by play of how my dad is reacting to her insanity and her calling him heartless and cruel, that he's acting like her dad (My dad is not perfect but he is not a narc, just also deeply traumatized, and he is a good father). When I start to get visibly stressed by this, she will often say that she's only telling me this because ""I can't talk to anyone else about it"". 

She briefly went to therapy when I was around 13/14 but stopped quickly because apparently ""It was making me cry"". She now refuses to go because she thinks her only problems are her childhood trauma from her dad but now she's ""over it"" and she insists my dad is the one that needs it. She also doesn't like that I go so regularly. 

The worst part about all of this is that I'm the scapegoat, while my older brother is the golden child (late 20s, living on his own, we are close but he was in denial about my mom for a long time) who she sees herself in personality wise. So if she's not complaining to me about my dad or her life and confiding in me like there's no power imbalance, then she's taking out her anger on me, yelling at me, insulting me, playing the victim and gaslighting me, making me sound like I'm the abusive one. The worst of it is when she claims that I'm acting like my dad, that's how I know she is really angry at me.

1o57iv0,"Feeling slimed after ""innocent"" comment from Nmom","I live abroad. My narc brother and his wife live overseas too. Earlier this year I made it clear to my family that I wouldn’t be traveling home this Christmas to save money. My brother said *maybe* they’d go back, but nothing was certain.

I called home this weekend to be nice before my dad’s birthday next week — but the call got hijacked by my narc mom. She asked again about Christmas (I’ve already told them multiple times I’m not going), then started hinting about my brother’s 40th birthday party (which I only just heard about — it’s less than 2 months away). I reiterated my plans, but before hanging up she said:

“I’ll tell your sister-in-law you’re not coming.”

That comment stuck with me all day. Why *her* and not my brother? It felt loaded. Like they’re already setting me up as the one who’s “letting the family down.” I’m angry at myself for not speaking up, for not being more guarded, and for making the call in the first place.

Logically, planning international travel at this notice is unreasonable — but emotionally, I feel slimed, violated, gross, and furious. It’s like my energy’s been stolen over one tiny sentence.

Has anyone else had this kind of intense reaction to a narcissist’s “small” comment?

I said its not my fault shes being abusive, I am just not comfortable around her which is her fault.

she’s trying to manipulate me into picking up a dresser that was found at our apartment dumpsters up..4 fucking flight of stairs!!! And It’s heavy asf

She got a diagnosis for her health that should have put her at ease, now, she's moving onto wanting a new diagnosis for another ailment. I was playing with my cat and we somehow got into the fact our eldest is elven only for her to go; time went so fast, you should do what you want. I replied, well I am, I'm applying for grad school, going to shows but I just hate festivals - they suck. It was an innocent thing to say, I was laughing about it but she went silent and told me, don't you want to meet a man? For perspective, I am 33 and closeted bisexual since she brow beat  me into stating I am not bisexual, just confused. I don't look my age at all, I meet plenty of men and women but no one has struck my eye whatsoever and naturally I do not want to bring a partner home cause of my mom not out of shame but just the hassle. Anyway, I shrugged and went not really I'm having a lot of fun right now. My mom then snapped; you're not getting any younger, I hope you know that. I know she was being cruel to be cruel but a part of me just withered when I left the room like, yeah, maybe she is right I'll never have a partner or marry.

1o54kgx,Some days are really harder than others and pretending to be okay in those moments is really the worst feeling...,"Ive done A LOT of work on myself to just be normal and stable, im in a good space, but sometimes like everyone in the world you just have those off days where the entire world seems to drop itself on your head and you feel everything. 

As much as i lean on my healthy outlets like Journaling, meditating and whatever else, sometimes i often wonder what it would feel like to have someone you can be honest with about this life, not just online but in person, a true listener with empathy and care, what it would be like to show the expression that i feel inside, to be a moody asshole without it being an issue or being told my mood is the reason for every downfall in the relationship, for just a minute i wanna be allowed to feel that and express it, to not be the person that i am required to be but to be the person i currently feel on the inside. Unapologetically presenting the version of emotional torment that you're feeling within and wear it as a shell for everyone to see

I just wanna share some hardcore shit about my life without people thinking im suicidal or depressed or directing me to therapy or some repetitive advice about ""stay strong or keep going"" or acting overly concerned and placing me on a 'check up' list where they talk to me all soft and sensitive and make a fuss about it to coddle me just because i shared something personal. 

What we go thru is fucked up and it shouldnt happen, but a lot of this is redeemable thru healing, what i hate tho is living a life where i have to act normal while always carrying this whole other person inside of me that wasnt loved, handled correctly, neglected, gaslighted, invalidated, disrespected, and treated like the enemy, the same person that is lowkey envious of people with good parents and shed a tear when they see parents and children exchange bare minimum respect and love, that longs for love and want their parents to be mommy and daddy to them and overall, to not just walk around like its all okay. We are meant to build our own lives and heal and detach but no matter how much therapy, healing, prayer, forgiving takes place, that abandoned and crying child is still within us and having to hide that while it tears you up within is just the worst feeling ever. 

This will never change, and even if you find trustworthy people, a partner, kids, genuine friends and build yourself a new and happy life theres still that part within that is broken and sad, and it'll never surface bc you dont want it seeping into your new life, your new family, your new world, bc ruining your happiness or ruining the one's around you by passing on the brokeness inside is not something we wish to do, so even tho that part of you is constantly knocking and screaming inside to come out, it always and forever will be kept hidden. 

I live a double life that no one will ever know of, and as much as i hate the broken part of that life, i keep it because its a reminder not to treat people like i was treated and to always encourage, love, care and support every child i come across and not try to cut off their wings whenever they express excitement of wanting to fly.

1o53j0d,Recovering enmeshment/financial trauma : How can I find a place to live w/o proof of income?,"Hi all, I'm trying to get myself out of a sticky situation and I could really use some advice to point me in the right direction.

**QUICK BACKSTORY (scroll down for current issue)**: I was raised by an undiagnosed bpd/narc and an avoidant/codependent, enabler. Basically a cocktail of crazy-making and soul-killing for a childhood. And yes, they're still together. I'm late-20s and I spent this last decade recovering from damages: severe enmeshment trauma, an annihilated identity, disregarded boundaries, being treated as an object/possession rather than a human being, and undoing the limiting beliefs that have kept me stuck/pseudo-incompetent for YEARS. I've made great strides in my psychological recovery, however, in many other aspects, specifically financial, I have not. I learned early that everyone else was able to make money, but I couldn't, and that money could not be trusted unless my parents were the ones to distribute it. Money was basically a control tactic. I've always tried very hard to make money, but I've never achieved full stability/independence.

For reference, as an adult I'd kept bpd/narc at arm's length, but had always been close with enabler.

Both had been chipping away at my self worth, inserting themselves in my life without being asked, infantilizing me, not taking no for an answer. I'd speak up, set very clear boundaries, tell them that I did not like what they were doing and to please stop - but of course that fell on deaf ears. Then finally came the day where they pushed me over the edge. So I cut contact. It was devastating. I don't know what the future will hold, but for now *this is what I need to just get my life back*.

**THE CURRENT ISSUE :**  **I have to move in a little over 3 months**. I've been working jobs that do not pay well and I am in overdrive searching for other streams of income. I'm not having much luck at all, and I've been trying to find better work long before cutting contact. I haven't even been able to secure a waitress or barista position! I have a comfortable savings cushion, however, if landlords are looking for proof of income, I have absolutely no shot at getting approval. My income now is not nearly enough to qualify. I'm trying not to panic, but I'm not sure what to do. In the past, enabler had helped me by applying as a guarantor to ensure approval. Obviously now I canNOT go to them for help, because as you all know, there can and will be strings attached.

To the people who've been in this type of situation, what did you do or what advice do you have to get through this?

\*\* I'm not necessarily looking for a permanent solution either. I don't have anyone I could crash with so that's off the table, but I'm open to temporary solutions.

1o53e5z,Beaten at the dinner table,"So basically the title. I've been diagnosed with autism at 20 and it explained a lot of things in my life. One thing that was explained by the diagnosis was me being a ""picky eater"". I wasn't really a picky eater, I was just very sensitive to textures and flavours. This made eating hard for me. I couldn't really eat because of these sensory issues and my parents did not like that. 

Some additional context is that I grew up poor. Because of that they would yell and scream at me for not eating cause I was ""wasting food"". I think part of it had to do with how people perceived me cause people constantly told me how skinny I was as a kid. So in an effort to not ""waste food"" they would beat me at the dinner table when growing up if i didn't eat all of my food. Sometimes even forcing me to eat the food i gagged out cause of sensory issues. Obviously this was traumatic and has caused a lot of issues that I deal with right now.



Now I'm 20 and I can't  eat meals properly. I always leave some food behind and can go days without eating as I have done before. 

My question is, how do I even attempt getting better? All of my searches lead to eating disorder resources which I don't think i have but i could be wrong. All of the professionals I've seen don't really know how to deal with it either. So if anyone who's dealt with something similar sees this, I'd really appreciate any advice.

1o531ow,I can’t breathe…,"Hey guys… this is gonna probably be a drawn out post because I can’t phrase anything for sh*t. 
Let’s start by saying I am 30 years old. 
I recently got sober (151 days today) and the last two years of my life I completely ruined do to my addiction. I was away from my family & now I live with my mom & my step dad because that’s who was there for me when I fell. 
Now that I’m sober I see straight through both of them. They treat me like I’m 12… they do very narcissistic things and I’m at my breaking point. If I didn’t need my mom, I feel like I’d go no contact… again….
Before drugs I found my soulmate who opened my eyes to my mom and her ways. Of course my mom hates my soulmate with a passion… I finally found someone who loves ME for ME but she hates him because he showed me her toxic ways. When I went no contact it was the happiest and most free feeling I could’ve ever felt… but now I need her and she knows it. I never have anyone to vent to and I feel desperate at this point. I’m not sure where I’m even going with this but I’m reading to rip my hair out. 
Is there some sort of programs in Pennsylvania that help with people in my situation? If I was on my own I’d be farther in my recovery than I am. But I am stuck in this house. 24/7… I can’t take it anymore.

Was listening to *song* and remembering that little girl in the backseat of my car, all her dolls buckled in, her saying “ play music daddy”. I often miss that little girl

I wanted to talk to you at  *nephews* bday, but when I saw your son, the hurt and pain of losing 3 years of not getting to know my grandson brought the anger back. 
He’s a handsome little guy
*sibling* told me about *ex dying by suicide*
I’m sorry for your loss

Me: 

Thank you for this message. This is a gift. It reminds me why I keep my distance. 

Had you approached me with an apology or curiosity about what you could do to repair our relationship, I may have been open. But this message is manipulative as hell. I am not a little girl, I am a grown woman. I didn’t have choices then, but I do now. 

I will not be guilt tripped or gaslighted by you anymore. You’ve missed out on my son’s life as a result of your own patterns of behavior. 

Funny you should mention *ex*; the way you primed me to fawn to egotistical men set me up perfectly for men like him. 
My child will not know that life.

Keep being mad for the next three years if you must, but direct it in the correct place- at yourself. Please don’t contact me or talk about me with my siblings again. Be sorry about this loss too.

1o52jmj,Forced to apologize after being wrongly accused of theft by GC brother.,"Yesterday morning, my mom dropped me (29M) off at the airport. We were supposed to grab breakfast right before. I was hoping my brother (27M) would come with us, but he said he’d just say bye at the door. As I was leaving, I grabbed a pair of USB-C Apple headphones I’d bought a few weeks ago when I drove from Vegas to Illinois.

When I got upstairs, my brother immediately fixated on them. He grabbed one end while I was still holding them and started interrogating me. 
 
GC: What kind are of headphones are these? USB-C?” 

Me: “yeah…”


GC: Where’d you get them? 

Me: umm, my desk? 

GC: Are these yours?” 

Me: yes..?

GC: are you sure? 

Me: “Dude, stop asking me about it, they’re mine” 

which apparently set him off. He tossed his end of the cord again (I hope you didn’t forget he was holding onto the other side of the cord that whole time) he  told me to “enjoy your trip,” and stormed off to his room.

I was stunned. My mom watched silently, looking at me like I had caused the scene. I called after him, went into his room, even told him he could have them if they were really his. Immediately, His girlfriend confirmed hers were in her bag, meaning the whole thing was a misunderstanding.

 but instead of apologizing, he accused me of “taking things from him in the past” which he is 100% guilty of doing himself… and he lectured me about my tone. I just wanted a hug before leaving… his gf said “just give him a hug” and he said “yeah that’s not happening…”.  I’ll let him know he could have the rest of my weed in the basement and to enjoy himself and I settled for a fist pound.

Later in the car, my mom said we were “both at fault” and claimed he was just “curious and wanted to know” and confused because he had just woken up, and that he was  “trying to diffuse” the situation by walking away. She couldn’t offer any support just repeated that I shouldn’t have reacted that way. 

Turned an okay trip into a shit trip. What a way to start the day!

Edit: I wanna thank you guys in advance for any replies and help that I receive and I wanna know if you’ve chosen to gray rock or go no contact and how your experience has been. I love them so much but hate them so much equally. Just doesn’t feel natural.

1o528mq,"I avoided this sub for years, and now I've moved back home and deeply regret it. Advice needed :(","I (27f) don't want to share too many stories because I'm looking for advice on how to cope... My mom is a textbook narcissist -- extremely traumatic and abusive immigrant upbringing, rigid cultural rules and expectations, with American-born children I don't think she'll ever understand.

I had to live here from 2020 to 2022 after graduating uni during the pandemic and it was absolutely miserable, even when I was doing well. In early 2022 I moved to the city where I lived for school and I've only been back here for holidays. I had an amazing job up there and I was living on my own (with roommates) for 3.5 years, and since then, I've done a lot of therapy, met my current communities, and really gotten to know myself. I've struggled with severe depression since I was a teen, and since I started proper medication in late 2023, I've felt much better about life.

However, I was being mistreated and severely overworked at my job (my boss bullied me out as he did with another woman in my position before she left) and I'm having trouble finding another job in my field... I'm sure you all are aware of how dogshit America is right now haha. I feel so bad, the news is unavoidable even from across the Pacific. I quit my job and decided to move back in with my parents to find a new job and save up for grad school abroad. I'm really excited for this next move - my therapist told me that moving home should be okayyyyy if I keep my one year saving goal in mind, but she reminded me of the problems I had with my mom before moving out. I guess I figured that I'd done a lot of work to become a better person over the years and I just assumed that my mom would chill out a bit with age. My mom seemed eager to have me back. She **hates** animals in the house and I'm living here with my cat and she seemed okay with it so I figured I'd sacrifice a bit to regain financial stability and maybe pay off my loans before I go back to school. I've made a huge mistake, though.

The rest is typical stuff I've been reading on here for the past few weeks. I'm 27, she treats me like a kid and doesn't respect me or listen to me. She blows up on me for tiny things. I was unemployed (starting a new job soon so I'm hoping for some relief) and spending a lot of time looking for a job and she called me lazy for that. I bought a car with the remainder of my emergency savings and she isn't happy with the little car I bought. She mocks me for being ""poor"" (she is classist and I am broke, not poor. No shame in poverty, but I have no right to claim that label). She tells me I'm acting too grown by keeping to myself. Any light criticism or defense of myself is rewarded with a tantrum where she starts yelling and calling me things like ""rude"" and ""ungrateful"" and ""miserable"". I was already depressed about moving away from my independent life and friends and my first ever romantic partner (they don't know about him because they're so rude. My mom used to call my friends ugly losers when we were in middle/high school so I've brought a friend over maybe twice in the past decade), but now I'm just. The most depressed I've been in years, even on fluoxetine. I stay in the basement now, and it's a really nice space, but I get no sunlight. I can't get out of bed, I miss my independence and my friends.... I just got a car 2 weeks ago and the weeks before that purchase were worse.

She is a real clean freak and woke me up yelling this morning about how my cat sheds around the house and I don't do anything about it. I vacuum once a week, I brush him, I run an air purifier, lint roll everywhere... I'm trying my best, I promise. I try to keep my space clean, stay out of her way, and ignore her, but the things she says to me hurts my soul. She is the reason I thought I was ugly since I was a kid... I'm not, and yet I'm starting to feel awful about myself again. I've always tried to do everything right - did well in school, got great jobs after college (my parents barely know what I do for a living. They like to brag about my brother because he studied STEM and I studied art), I didn't start partying until I graduated, I barely drink, I had no dating/sex life until this year, and I'm a regular weed smoker now but I started when I was 25..... My mom hates weed more than anything on the planet I think, so now she hates me for that despite it being a huge positive contributor to my mental health. She also hates that I'm a ""freak"" (I'm a very nerdy goth adult and into Japanese alternative fashion, and I was an anime scene kid and my parents have always hated it. I guess it's an immigrant assimilation thing) and super comfortable with it. Like, I dress how I want and I love my weird hobbies and interests. My parents have been trying to beat shame into me about these things since I was a kid.

Sorry for typing so much and thank you for reading. I know this all doesn't sound so bad, and I haven't gotten a beating or anything more than a slap since I was much younger, but my mom has been saying incredibly awful things about me/to me since I hit puberty, and being back in this house in this town I despise I feel like the extremely angry, self-hating, depressed teenager I used to be. I think that starting my new job soon will help, but how do I cope with this? I get yelled at if I breathe wrong. She's so mean to me and people in my life seem to not take it very seriously. I feel so sad, I try to be nice and introspective and empathetic but it's like talking to a kid with her. I'm so broke though, I'm not sure what to do.

tl;dr - I got bullied out of my dream job in a city and decided to move back in with my nMom and eDad(?) in their small town with my cat to save up for grad school and get my life back on track. Now I am alone and miserable and being treated with so much contempt and disrespect it's unbelievable.

1o50pln,My n mom said having no dad is worse than having an extremely abusive dad to my face & idk,"how to look at her anymore. 

I went through things from my (also) n dad and his wife that qualify as torture and extreme abuse. I don’t really want to get into the details of that because that’s not the point of this post. 

My mom knows some of what I’ve gone through, anytime I’ve been too open she says things like “I don’t want to hear about this” or “I know it was awful but can we change the subject?” and proceeds to talk about her issues and her problems. She’s been like that my entire life, from big to small things.

Well the other day on the phone she brings up the topic of dads again, even though i’ve asked her so many times to stop bringing up dads if she doesn’t want to hear me talk about what mine put me through, and she said to me “I know what your dad did was bad but at least you had a dad; I didn’t and neither did your sister and I’d say that’s worse.” 

And reader, I would give anything to not have a dad. So I calmly (very deliberately  calmly ) asked “You think what my dad did was ok enough to want him for a dad?” and she, without even hesitating said “yes”. I laughed in her face unfortunately because I could not believe she said that to me. She does know but chooses not to remember anything I tell her apparently. I am in shock. It’s not the worst thing she’s done to me or told me, but I cannot believe her selfishness, her self centeredness. How dare she. I wish I could go no contact and never have to talk with her again , but I can’t for many reasons. 

It’s been a few days and the shock and hurt is really setting in. I just needed to get this out. Thanks for reading if you got this far. Hugs to anyone who can understand.

Even though they come in different shapes, genders, and race.. they seem to follow the same script of dysfunction across the board that leaves life long scars to those around them. Almost like a game book where they agree that losing the respect and love from their own offsprings is better than accepting the tenderness and complexity of life, and being imperfect enough to acknowledge that self improvement even as a parent is the core root of upholding deep connections. They will never change for their children because ultimately they don't find value in changing for themselves.

It started off with a pop by hand if they ever thought I was giving them issues, but around when i turned 10 my mother started beating me with any object that was near her if she felt like i needed to be ""disciplined"" or if she was doing something and wanted me to shut up she would pinch my skin until either i kept quiet or it left a bruise. Once i turned around 13 she would try to start full-blown physical fights with me by taunting me and getting up in my face, one day i smacked the fuck out of her for doing that, and for a while, she quit hitting me. Not to mention throughout all this, my dad was working a shit ton and only ever listened to her side of the story which just made him fed up and violent towards me.

For reference i had a opened water bottle in my hand bc i was sipping on it, after saying that my father proceeds to lunge at me grab the open waterbottle causing it to spill everywhere and after he snatches it from my hand he tried to pick me up to slam be on the ground but i quickly fell all my bodyweight to the floor to keep him from being able to reach me.Since i did that he kicked me in the leg and walked off. My mom walks over and started yelling at me to get up and clean the mess and i straight up told her no that i didnt make it so i wasnt dealing with it. After that i stood up to go back to my room and my mom threatened to slap me but i just kept walking. Fastforward to when we were riding around, I had forgotten to fasten my seatbelt and had fdallen asleep in the back of the car. I then felt someone grab my ass so i woke up frantic and slapped their hand away, that person being my mom. I had headphones on and didnt give a fuck about what she wanted so i just rolled back over and tried to go back to sleep. A few minutes later i felt the car stop, turns out my dad had pulled over somewhere so i sat up and my dad was already hollering in my face for me to buckle my seatbelt. I expressed no problem with it and even had grabbed my seatbelt to fasten it, but he jumped out of the car opened the door to the backseat and started yelling in my face. My mom then came through the other side of the car door and started beating me with her shoe. Instinctly i slapped her arm and told her to stop, after that my dad grabbed my wrists and pinned me down while my mom repeatedly hit me in the head. Does anyone have any advice on what to do? I feel unsafe with them but idk what to do.

1o4zruo,My mom kicked me out at 13 and still thinks it was “normal parenting”,"When I was 13, my mom kicked me out of the house for around half an hour during an argument. I don’t even remember what started it, but I remember standing outside feeling scared and humiliated.

Recently, she actually brought it up herself and said it was just a “normal parenting tactic.” Hearing that confirmed I didn’t imagine it...she genuinely believes treating a child like that is okay. She literally said, “Oh, I just did that to scare you.”

So you admit you were trying to control and dominate me, not teach me a lesson? I just grey rocked the entire conversation because there’s no convincing her she was wrong.

Then she added, “Don’t worry, I watched you like a hawk,” and “Do you seriously think I would actually kick you out and be serious about it?” Like, what do you mean? You already did. It doesn’t matter if it was for twenty minutes, you shouldn’t have done it at all.

And then she said, “Oh, I expected a sobbing child, but you were just pissed off and went to your room.” Damn straight I was pissed off. I shouldn’t have had to deal with that kind of shit at thirteen years old.

Then she goes, “If you started to walk, I would’ve been scared.” Damn then maybe I should have kept walking.

Yo… what if I had walked away from that apartment? What if something had happened to me? What if I’d been kidnapped or assaulted? What if the police had shown up at her door to tell her her child was gone?

1o4zdf7,My dad finally broke free from an abusive narcissist. Looking for grounded book recommendations to help him keep boundaries and not fall back in,"FYI I used AI to help me write this because my thoughts are all over the place. This situation has been really emotional for me, and I wanted to express it clearly to get some good advice.

My dad is finally breaking free from a toxic, narcissistic marriage. He’s 73, very intelligent and kind, but extremely logical. He tends to rationalize people’s behavior instead of recognizing emotional manipulation. After years of control, guilt, and isolation, he finally caught my stepmom cheating, started documenting everything, and a judge sided with him. He even had her removed from the house by police after presenting clear evidence of her abuse.

He later discovered that she had been sending money to her lover, but thankfully he managed to recover most of his assets before things escalated further.

Even though he says he is still going through with the divorce, he has been acting as if things might be fixable. He talks to her daily, stays polite, and sometimes even sees her in person. He says it is just to keep things smooth until she signs everything, but we are afraid he might get emotionally drawn back in.

Recently he told us that she has been trying to seduce him again, but that he has drawn the line at having sex with her. Apparently she is using her sexuality to try to regain control over him, and so far he has resisted. On one hand, we are proud of how far he has come and how much strength it took to get her removed and stand up to her. On the other hand, we are worried she can snake her way back in and manipulate him into taking her back once the divorce is done.

For context, he cheated on my mom with this woman for nine years before leaving and marrying her. They had two kids together. The youngest has severe autism, and my dad is the one who takes care of him almost entirely. She barely helps, yet somehow always turns herself into the victim.

Over time she isolated him from everyone, including us, his other children. She made him cut ties, dictated who he could see, and even forced him to make us apologize to her once for how we had supposedly mistreated her. We did it just to keep contact with him, but it was never enough. Talking to her is emotionally exhausting. She drains people completely and makes everyone afraid to disagree with her.

She also claims to hear voices and says she receives information from “the great beyond.” My dad used to take that seriously, which terrified us. Recently she told him that she has been “illuminated” and that everything that has happened had to happen so that she could “ascend” spiritually and communicate at a higher level. It is basically her way of rewriting everything as destiny instead of taking any responsibility.

The one hopeful sign is that my dad has started making small jokes about her “visions,” which shows that he is starting to see through the fog. He has even said things like “the veil has been lifted” and “how could I have been so stupid” and “how could I let myself be fooled like that.” Hearing him say those things gives us hope, but we know awareness alone is fragile.

He does share kids with her, so we know he can’t completely cut her out of his life. What we really need is for him to see that narcissism is not something treatable, curable, or even manageable. He has told us that he is still very in love with her, but that he recognizes she has a mental illness and would only ever get back with her if she could “manage that illness.” That worries us deeply because it shows he still believes there is hope for her to change.

Their older son, my half-brother, found out about the affair by accident and helped my dad a bit, but he also shows narcissistic traits. The same day my dad told us he was finally free and spent time with us again, that son was throwing a house party with sex workers and posting explicit clips of them on social media. It was disturbing and heartbreaking.

I just want my dad to stay free, to stop second-guessing himself, and to protect himself emotionally this time.

I’m looking for books or resources that could help someone like him:
	
•	Understand narcissistic and emotionally manipulative dynamics
	•	Rebuild self-trust and boundaries after years of gaslighting
	•	See through guilt, chaos, and false “spiritual awakening” talk
	•	Stay strong and not get pulled back under the idea of “closure,” “understanding,” or “healing together”

I just joined the community and looked over the resources in the sidebar, those seem really good. 

He is logical and analytical, not a fan of overly emotional or pop-psychology books. Ideally something grounded, clear, and practical.

If you have seen a parent or loved one wake up from this kind of manipulation and stay free, what helped them most?

Thank you all so much for reading.

1o4xh88,Cannot trust my parents to help or do anything for me.,"I (37F) have been let down by my parents over the years so I have learned to not expect too much from them. My grandmother died a few months back. This was hard as I was close to her but I could not make it back for her funeral or to help clear out her house as I live 10 hours away and there was some other stuff going on. One of the things my grandmother had all of her granddaughters do back 11 years ago was to pick out one of her nice rings from her jewelry collection. I chose her wedding and engagement ring. So when my parents went to help get things in order my dad asked what rings we picked out. I said grandma's wedding and engagement ring. They said they got it. Cut to a few months later at a family reunion, parents give us (my sister and I) the jewelry we picked out. Except that the rings I asked for are not where to be found. My mom and dad said I asked for a different ring and I showed them via text where that was not the case and that I should be grateful they got me what I did. I am so angry by their attitude because they are like it is just a thing but I know that if the tables were turned that they would have made sure they got what they wanted. Now I am not sure who may have the rings or even what went down. Part of me thinks another family member asked for them and my parents traded one of the other rings with out telling me as some of their other actions in the past have reflected this type of behavior.

1o4wn47,Middle class narcs and money... nparents rant because I asked back 500$ of my own money for a laptop after spending 1 year without one,"Title says it all. I'm new here but have been perusing this sub for a while. Today I really need to vent. 

So I just had a call with n""mother"" and her agent (aka enabler ""father"") as they call me every 2 weeks or so.

I recently bought myself a new 600$ PC and happened to have had 500$ left in an old account my parents own. Basically these were the last $ I had stored outside of my own personal bank account. I had spent over a year without a laptop because mine was broken and I was too in debt to buy an other one. 

Nmother and ""father"" combined earn at least 7k$ a month. Dad has a Jaguar car worth thousands (at least 55k$). Golden child sis works at a bank and is already landowner at 25. Meanwhile I work at a warehouse for 11$ an hour. I have a broke car and rent a flat.

Passing in the conversation I asked for my 500$ back, because mind you with that low wage I have if anything goes wrong with the car and I have to pay repairs or whatnot little problem that requires finances I'd better not spend 600 bucks right away.

I didn't even call them for the money thing, they were the ones to call me for they biweekly inquisitive call that always resembles more of a police interrogation rather than a call between parents and child.

And so they insisted not to give it to me, that it was ""not even my money but what my grandmothers had given for me back in the days and that it was actually theirs"". After arguing I finally got these 500$ transferred... after a nearly 30 min long interrogation. ""Oh and what is your gf doing? Still unemployed? Oh and do you remember how useless your father's brother is, he's really not helpful? Oh and will you come for Christmas, though of course since we gave you these 500$ you won't have neither a Christmas nor a birthday present...""

I feel utterly broken mentally, as if metaphorically two thugs had pushed me down on the ground and beaten the shit out of me with metal bars. 

Am I the one being crazy here or can anyone relate? Why is it that middle class people are so cheap when it comes to money? 500$ for them is literally pocket money. They can spend more than that within a week of eating out I'm sure. Oh and see how I'm brainwashed by their gaslighting... rereading myself, they are so cheap with MY OWN money??

For a bit of context, I've always had a conflicted relationship with both parents (and also every other family member except one of my grandmothers who likes me). My mother is your typical malevolent, dark triad NPD-like (no diagnosis of course) narc.

1o4w9km,Horrible reaction to reaching out to Nmom's sister,"Hi y'all, I went NC with my nmom about 18 months ago, around the same time my edad died of cancer, and I found out I was pregnant with my first child after 16 months of trying. So it was a big time. Also moved to the other side of the world 6 months later. And at this time, my nmom's sister, who I considered to be my favourite aunt just stopped contacting me. Nothing. Nada. After a call with my uncle (her husband, who used to be a cop) 3 months ago, where he really just asked me to reach out, I got to a place where I could contact her with compassion to just try get some idea of where she was at, and honestly, just to tick off the box of ""I tried"". Wow the response. I was kind of feeling like the lack of any contact may have left some room for a reasonable conversation to happen now. Nope. And the stuff she linked was IG accounts about manifestation and stuff.

My message: ""Hi AUNT, 

I haven't heard from you since my dad died and I found out I was pregnant with BABY, who is now almost 8 months old.

I honestly don't know why that is, but as I said to UNCLE a couple of month back, I have been deeply hurt by your lack of support through this very difficult time.

Having spoken to other people, it seems like you had a tough time growing up and Grandma and Grandad weren't always the best parents. I've been reading a really great book called ""It Wasn't Your Fault: Freeing Yourself from the Shame of Childhood Abuse with the Power of Self-Compassion"". It talks a lot about how the trauma that someone suffers as a child can end up affecting the rest of their life, and honestly, I think you experience a lot of shame, and it's keeping you stuck on whatever issue is getting in your way, and keeping you from being able to work through it.

Maybe I'm totally off base here, but I think you must have a lot going on internally to have done what you've done.

I know you're not the biggest fan of therapists but I think you might benefit from talking to one and working through whatever thoughts/feelings etc are affecting you right now, because to me, this is a pretty big deal.

Or, alternatively, if you're totally happy with your decision to cut all contact with me, as you've done, then it's your life and that's your choice.""

1o4w6ye,Why don't they understand they're unwanted?,"My narcissistic mother will constantly impose her presence on everyone in the house. She's been abusive to her entire family, but has slightly mellowed out in recent years since retirement. But she's just unbearable in a different way. Aggressively pushy, just less hostile.

My EDad is clearly permanently uncomfortable with her presence, but it's like she had no idea. She'll happily blab at him at random shit he either hates or doesn't give a shit about, talks so endlessly that she hardly breathes in between, and he usually doesn't respond and she doesn't care that he doesn't until she decides she suddenly demands a comment on something, and then it's an issue. He's a mix of just being meek, and having been taught by her to not cross her, so he just tolerates it until he reaches his limit and shouts maybe once, then goes back into his shell when she starts threatening with suicide etc.

She'll literally stand and stare at you and it's like she's a void with not a single thought in her head. She'll constantly ask inane questions or state things nobody gives a shit about (""I'll go downstairs now"", ""I'll just eat a bit""). She'll just stand there in silence until she comes up with something to ask or say and coerce you I to acknowledging her existence, cause if you ignore her she'll probably flip out.

I'm always on edge when I'm visiting my parents house because she's like this oppressive omnipresence. The time she leaves is a relief, and then every moment right after that is clouded by anxiety about when she's gonna return. When she's not talking, she's banging cabinet doors, her mug against the table, stomping, watching smth on the tv or her laptop so loudly that everyone in the house hears it.

Why do they keep pushing even when everyone is clearly uncomfortable with them? Even when told directly to not engage with someone, they just push and push and cross any and all set boundaries like they were never there. 
Why do they keep pushing and pushing at people when it only makes them hate the narc more?

1o4w3na,My mother has booked a flight after finding my house on Google Maps,"My NMother has found my new address through pictures she got from other family that I stupidly had shared a year ago. She used Google street view to locate the buildings and found the exact address.

She also located my husband‘s workplace because he is listed on their website and wants to show up there, too. 

I am shaking. I don’t know what to do.

1o4vaz9,First date went great until...,"I went on a first date a few days ago. We met online and I had low expectations going in as we didn't know much about each other but I was pleasantly surprised. We had a ton in common.  
  
He picked me up, was a gentleman, asked a lot of questions about me, he was very respectful, kept joking about how he was a U-Haul lesbian and gets attached easily wanting to spend all his time with the person he's dating, how he couldn't wait to see me again etc. etc.

He suggested we go back to his neighborhood after our date for more cool bars to hang out in. Driving to his place under the pretenses we were parking at his place and then walking to a second location. He started kissing me in his driveway then carried me inside clearly not wanting to go to another venue.   
  
Once inside, we talked and laughed and were having great chemistry. I've never made someone laugh so hard which I thought was a sign he was definitely into me. So, when he pulled me over to make out again, I was 100% on board.   
  
He then pulled me on top of him and took his glasses off...and I SWEAR his entire aura, expression, and eye contact changed. He was looking at me chin down, peering up like an animal watching its prey with a sickly desire. The way he looked at me before was so sweet and respectful- this was like a different person. Almost like the stare in Clockwork Orange. Like some sort of curtain had dropped and he was showing his inhumane animalistic urges. It's hard to explain but I had never experienced that before.  
  
So I said ""whoa, your facial expression totally changed just then"". He ignored it and didn't reply since his face was still sort of stuck in this completely objectified stare. He denied any change and I crawled off, he put his glasses back on and said he was tired.  I live like 5 minutes away so when he said he would call me a car and would not be driving me home, I said ""haha good one!"" Until I realized he was serious.   
  
He insisted I text me as soon as I was home safe. I did yet he ghosted me and probably won't hear from him again. 

As someone who's been love bombed and or confused by the intentions of potential narcissists that enter my life, I'm afraid my vocal observation cost me a potential connection.

1o4vadl,My parents are ruining my life and sabotaging my relationship with a good person,"I 32 (f) have always had issues with my parents being emotionally abusive and when I was a child also physically. As a result I’ve got mental health issues and can’t work due to it or form many relationships. I’ve also got no other family as they are all dysfunctional. I haven’t had an easy life due to all this and find it very hard to trust others, therefore I have had for most of it, very little friends and barely anything to look forward to.

About 8 months ago I met a lovely man on a dating app. Things have been going very well for us so far and I’ve finally felt as though I’ve got something to live for. He also had been getting to know my family, however I’d covered up all the bad stuff and the fact I suspect they’re narcissistic.

Anyway today, I’ve had a blazing row  with my parents over an item becoming wedged and jammed in their house and I had to tell my parents about it as I couldn’t fix it (can’t give away too many details in case it’s too outing) my dad completely and unnecessarily blew up on me over it.

Basically my boyfriend is taking me on holiday this week and my dad was shouting about how I’m going away and leaving them with the problem. This felt very unfair and over the top. They’ve always responded like this whenever there is an issue, I’ve always felt unable to tell them things due to their reaction. I yelled back at him that it was just an accident, to which he told me “Your an accident and I should have worn a condom so I didn’t conceive you.” He is suspected autistic and often says really evil things. I have been told to die in a foreign country, as well as take myself to a clinic in Switzerland and kill myself. My dad has called me vile names my entire life, things like spastic (I’m autistic) a freak, a little b\*\*stard, etc. I’ve got zero self esteem whatsoever because of it.

My mum never sticks up for me, just sides with him when she witnesses his behaviour, and I tell her itand enables his behaviour, telling me things like I’m a poison little dwarf and a troublemaker, I’m dangerous, because I tell other people about their behaviour, and to get out of their house when visiting them. She also enjoys threatening to sue me for speaking out about them.

Today, we were planning to cook and eat a meal together, them, me, siblings and boyfriend until this massive row over practically nothing kicked off. My boyfriend arrived to their house and sat with me whilst I attempted to stand up for myself towards my mother.

She told him all the things I had done to her (most were in retaliation to her abuse) and that I had spat at her once a long time ago, yes I shouldn’t have done that but I have been literally pushed to breaking point in the past. I feel she told him this to try and ruin my relationship with him, and put negative thoughts in his head about me, she had no real good reason for telling him this, and I just fear that he’s going to leave me now and I’ll end up with no one. I’ll never forgive them if this happens, this man has brought light into a life I just didn’t previously see worth living to be honest.

How should I handle all this? Should I just cut ties with my parents and risk losing my boyfriend too who comes from a good family, isn’t used to this kind of thing and was frankly horrified by it all.",Agreeable-Art6367,1760290493.0,3,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o4vadl/my_parents_are_ruining_my_life_and_sabotaging_my/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o4vadl/my_parents_are_ruining_my_life_and_sabotaging_my/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o4v2rx,I'm so tired of this,"Hi All. Sorry for what is probably going to end up as a really long post and I really appreciate anyone who takes the time to read this. 

My family have just left after coming round for a meal and as always I've been left feeling reeling, but even more so than I normally would do. I've worked really hard to put boundaries in place with my parents but every time they are here for any length of time I end up feeling like a helpless little girl again. Yesterday, my dad sent me a house listing for a house that is round the corner from their house. I currently live alone but love my house and have never said any differently. There are a few things that still need doing on it, but it's given me freedom away from them and somewhere I finally feel safe. But my dad's idea was that as the house he sent me the listing for doesn't have parking, I could park my car in their driveway. This has made me feel really panicky because I know the whole idea behind that is so they would be able to monitor my movements (which they would then grill me about). I quickly shut it down and made a joke about how it would make a great house to do up and sell on, but that I don't have the money to be able to do that. 

Today, my mum made several snidey comments about me, one of which was that I don't trust her and haven't done for a long time. That is absolutely true, but it made me feel so incredibly guilty and took me straight back to that place of feeling like I needed to apologize and make it up to her because I don't want her to feel upset. Thankfully, I didn't rise to it and she then made another comment about how if I did trust her, I would be so much further on with my house. She also made a comment about a crack in one of my garden walls and asking about whether I needed to get that fixed before I have my gate put up. I explained that as the crack is undermining the stability of the wall, it would need fixing first. She then stated that I ""may not still be here"" by the time something needs doing with it. 

Now, just for a little bit more context, I am undergoing some tests currently for possible breast cancer. Fingers crossed it turns out to be nothing but I'm having more tests done again this week and my mum is fully aware of everything. I'm inclined to think she was more meaning that she hopes I will have moved house and live closer to them but part of me is wondering whether she said that simply because she knew how hurtful that would be with what I've got going on atm. 

I'm just feeling so scared that I'm going to end up stuck back in a situation where they're back controlling my life. I'm also really fearful that they're going to see this post (not that either of them ever go on reddit) and will go off on one at me. But if it suddenly disappears, I've lost my nerve.

That’s what my childhood looked like: fear, bruises, and crying behind closed doors while neighbors acted like nothing was wrong.

I’m 22 now, and nothing’s changed. He still drinks, still explodes, still makes our house feel like a prison. I don’t even feel anger anymore — just this cold hatred and exhaustion. I’ve caught myself praying that something will happen to him, something that finally ends it all for my mom. I know that sounds wrong, but I can’t help it.

So instead i feel this song sounds better for those who feel the same

When I was small, you said I owed you everything,
Your love was earned, not freely given out.
I tried so hard to make you proud and please you,
But every smile just turned into a shout.

You break me down, to make yourself feel bigger,
You steal my light, and claim it as your own.
You take my wings, then say I should fly higher —
You break me down, and call that “raising home.”

You taught me shame and called it discipline,
You mocked my tears, then said I was too cold.
I learned to doubt the voice that lived within me,
You shaped my heart from guilt and heavy gold.

You break me down, to make yourself feel stronger,
You drown my truth, so only yours is known.
You call it love, but love would hold me softer —
You break me down, and call that “raising home.”

But now I see the chains you tried to hand me,
And I can choose to lay your burden down.
I’ll raise myself — without your shadow on me,
I’ll find my worth where you can’t drag me down.

You broke me down, but I am slowly healing,
Your voice fades out — I’ve found my own true tone.
Now I rise up, with scars that tell my story —
I raise me up… I raise me up alone.

I realised I'm always the one who has to tell her what's going on in my life because she doesn't ask. And when I do tell her, she only gives me one-word answers, no enthusiasm, interest or follow-up questions and then changes the topic back to herself. I guess I never realised how self-obsessed she was until I actually had something to tell her and couldn't get a word in.

I want to run away, leave them far away: since my childhood until I was 16 years old I have been surrounded by parents who don’t give a damn about my mental health. To make it short: I have misophonia and anxiety because of my mother’s constant crying and screaming, which created in me a visceral hatred of her voice. Every time she yells or cries I want to strangle her, and this started when I was 10 years old. Although my mother knows about it, she refuses to make an appointment with a psychologist to see what’s going on. She said it’s my fault that I became like this and she didn't give a shit if i was mentally ill and that my other family members didn’t have any mental disorders except me.

1o4sjca,Dad Ruined the Only Vacation we Ever Had,"Since being confronted with the possibility that my dad is a narcissist, or at the very least has narcissistic tendencies, I've been digging around in my brain both trying to find evidence this isn't true, and proof that it is. I can't believe I scrubbed this from my memory until now.


I grew up poor. Really poor. We never left my hometown more than once in a blue moon, let alone went on vacation. When I was 18, my mom finally decided they could save up enough to go on a nice extended weekend trip to a nearby amusement park.


Home life was really rough for me then, and I was planning on moving out. My mom begged me to wait until after the vacation. ""We're just all burnt out. You'll see. We'll have a nice time and we'll all feel a lot better."" So I waited.


It was a disaster. Dad accused mom of picking a vacation only her and I would like, because he and my Nsister hate rides, and he and my little sister hate water. He ignored the fact that she picked a hotel with a hockey themed restaurant (he was obsessed with hockey at the time) and the package she got included tickets to the zoo and botanical gardens. He only focused on the amusement park, and the fact that the hotel had a nice pool. She literally asked each of us one thing we wanted most out of a vacation, and found a location that had all of it.


First day, we take the free shuttle to the park, he gets stopped because he took his pocket knife with him. He doesn't want it tossed, so mom suggested we go back to the hotel, drop it off and come back. He refuses. Instead, he elects to sit on a bench outside the park and wait for us ALL DAY. With only one parent, and a kid who is too little for the bigger rides, and a kid who hates bigger rides, I ride exactly 1 rollercoaster. We spend most of the day at the water park, which my ""water hating"" sister enjoys.


Second day, mom wanted to do the zoo in the morning, and the botanical gardens in the evening. At this point, Nsister is just as pissy as dad because she can't believe we abandoned him yesterday, and now he's sun burnt because we are selfish. The walk through the zoo was fine, but you could tell they were both reluctant about having fun. When it came time for the botanical garden, dad bitched about how it was supposed to rain, and how he told Mom it was going to rain, and we could only do one thing today. We brought umbrellas and it was meant to be a light rain. Mom spent an hour crying in the shower while we all awkwardly sat there. We didn't go to the garden.


Third day, we spent the morning at the pool (except dad) ate lunch at the restaurant and went back to the amusement park. Due to dad wanting to keep the family together, and not trusting me, his 18yo to wander a park alone, I AGAIN did not ride any of the rides I wanted until it began to downpour and he wanted to leave. I begged to stay and wait for the rain to stop to ride the coaster I was most excited to ride. Dad was annoyed, but somehow I ended up permitted to wait in the empty que while the rest of them went to the hotel and get packed to leave. I got to ride my ride, but was told I was dumb on the way home because I was soaking wet, and they had to pack for me.


I moved out after that.

1o4ro7z,Recovering flying monkey,"Spent today reflecting on my relationships with family and friends. I'm quite disconnected/isolated from a lot of them at the moment because I feel like I can't trust them, nor myself, to decide if they are people I am safe with, mentally/emotionally. 

I've spent a lot of my adult years being a flying monkey, mostly for my nmother. Looking back, I can see how I was so easily taken in by her victim stories and was willing to jump in and defend her with others, because when I was serving her needs she would make me feel valued and special. 

Looking back I realise that she triangulated all of us with the goal of all of the focus, effort and attention leading back to her. It makes me angry that I chose ""her side"" so many times over other members of my family and that I didn't see what was going on. After a childhood of abuse and neglect I think I was just grateful for the attention and it reinforced the belief that I was the problem.

I still find it hard though to not step in and rescue others. Part of me just doesn't like to see others struggle and likes to help, but if I'm really honest with myself I like the feeling that comes from doing something good for others. I'm not sure if that's a normal though, or if I'm just trying to substitute the supply that my nmother gave me with a supply from others.

1o4r1gp,How do you deal with helping a parent who disgusts you and abused you your whole life?,"I’m struggling badly. My mother was emotionally cold, critical, and physically abusive when I was growing up. No affection, just punishment, silent treatment, and constant control. Now she’s old, sick, and in the hospital, and I’m expected to help her.

Every visit makes my skin crawl. Her smell, her voice, her bossy tone - it all triggers me. She orders me around (“push me,” “move this,” “help me sit,” “reorganize this table”), and if I hesitate, she gets irritated. I feel physically disgusted and emotionally drained afterward.

I don’t want to touch her. I don’t want to be her caregiver or social worker. I hate that I still go and that she can still make me feel small, scared, and powerless.

How do people handle this? How do you show up (if you have to) without falling apart or feeling like you’re betraying yourself?

1o4qib5,"Nparents are so mad I went NC, but they planted the seed years ago","As the title suggests, I’m (24 M, going on 25) NC with pretty much my entire family and have talked about it plenty of times on this subreddit already. But as I reflect on my late teens and early 20s, I’m starting to realize that, for all their anger and upset about my decision to establish hard boundaries, I don’t think they ever realized that they were the ones that pushed me to this decision.

A couple instances over the past few years come up when I think about this situation. First, there was my nparents both relapsing on nicotine when I was 17, despite my ndad being 5 years clean and my nmom being over a decade clean. Not only did they relapse, but they actively lied to me and my siblings about it, covering up smoke breaks by saying they needed fresh air or wanted to go look at the moon. Ndad would go into a convenience store and tell me to stay in the car, then come out and say he was buying a lottery ticket (extremely out of character for him). But I could write a whole memoir about that section of my life, so I’ll stop myself here.

Then, when the pandemic hit and the world turned upside down, I was given an extended spring break while my university figured out what to do, and the state government shut down all public schools indefinitely. Nmom spent dinner one night berating my siblings and me, saying we were being lazy and wasting our lives because we were spending the time off sleeping in and just trying to figure our lives out. Mind you, I was an essential worker still going to work during this situation.

Then in early 2021, I was given a promotion at the very same job. I was a full-time manager. I spent weeks training and preparing to be allowed to run the store I worked at on my own. The time came, and the first night I was in charge by myself, I noticed my ndad walking up to the doors, saying he got a bad feeling and wanted to check on me. This was honestly humiliating. Here I was, one of the youngest managers in the company, and here my father came trying to check on me like I was a child. It honestly felt like he didn’t trust me.

And this was all before I met my wife. I could go on and on about everything that happened when she and I started dating. Pulling me from a date night to tell me my wife was bad news, slamming a screen door in my face because I didn’t appreciate being called a terrible son, trying to force me on a four-hour road trip the weekend my wife and I closed on our house.

1o4pzq6,Anyone reading / who has read the book Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents? Need your insights reg. an exercise,"The exercise is called ”Identifying Your Healing Fantasy and Role-Self”. I'm struggling with the ”healing fantasy”-part. In the exercise, you're supposed to complete the following sentences. My answers to these questions go like this (the parts written in *italics* are my answers):

I wish other people were more *empathetic*.

Why is it so hard for people to *put themselves in others' shoes*?

For a change, I would love someone to treat me like *a person whose feelings, needs and experiences matter.*

Maybe one of these days I’ll find someone who will *love me just the way I am, with both my positive and negative qualities*.

In an ideal world with good people, other people would *pay attention to* *each others' needs and help those in need*.

So according to this exercise, I yearn for empathy and being validated and loved the way I am. In my opinion, these are healthy expectations and I shouldn't settle for anything less in human relationships. (Of course, I can't expect anyone to be there for me *all the time* but that's not my expectation either). However, according to the author, these are nothing but unrealistic fantasies which I should give up in order to become more mature, or something like that. That just doesn't make sense to me.

1o4otpi,WHY IS THIS MESSING WITH MY HEAD??,"Hi all,

I feel a bit stupid posting this as I’ve learned so much in the last year of being NC. I’ve read around the issue of narcissistic parents, devoured podcasts and literature, and generally feel pretty confident speaking to, and advising people. But this one thing is doing my head in and I need to reach out. I should know better.

Long story short, around a decade of increasingly problematic and toxic behaviour with my nparents blew up this time last year after a disagreement about how we were “suitably dressing” our new daughter blew up into a huge row, where for the first time in my life I fully stood up to them and it got real ugly. Two days later I got a letter from my nfather basically saying I was out of any inheritance and that I “needed medical help” and that my behaviour was “unforgivable”. We sent a very careful letter back essentially breaking down all of the issues we’d had over the past decade. The constant belittling. The aggressive pushing of right-wing politics, and mocking of our positions (which we never brought up). The inability to acknowledge mental health. We crafted this letter carefully, and ended it with telling them that we loved and appreciated them. The letter we got back was an absolute horror show. A total character assassination, which also suggested that they believed that following the aforementioned argument, they thought I would drive 200 miles in the middle of the night to break into their home. I’m in a job that requires significant professional vetting, so if they reported me for this nonsense, this could easily lead to me being suspended.

As a result, we insisted on family counselling. Now I’ve realised subsequently that this was a mistake, but at the time it seemed right. We agreed to pay, and for them to have the chance to choose the counsellor, as they do not believe in therapy. They tried to sabotage it from the start, dismissing a lady we had booked because of “spelling errors” and calling my mum the wrong name in an email (I now think they were already trying to talk about us behind our back and the therapist told them to back off, but I don’t know this). Anyway, we started therapy and they were using it as a way of trying to “win”. Not talk about deeper feelings. Just to dominate. We went along with this for a while. We apologised and were upfront about our failings (of course we have them). They apologised for nothing, but we did feel positive that things were out in the open. We even felt an openness that, whilst not perfect, seemed to be going somewhere. We even had them spend time with our daughter, and even babysit her. We were bending over backwards to accommodate them, even sending expensive Christmas and birthday gifts. Despite feeling wronged, we were wanting to mend things, and we had a sense of hope.

Then it happened. All of a sudden, when we thought we were making progress, they turn on us, Out of nowhere. That nice conversation for ndad's birthday? Didn't happen. The presents we sent? Nah? Subsequent horrible humiliation and insults. Only this time we kicked back, It wasn't nice. Two hours of horror with the therapist looking baffled.

At that point, I was in a weird position as I didn't want (even then) to go NC. We had a daughter, I felt so guilty that we would not have her see them. Even the therapist talked about a ""formal relationship"". My wife hated that idea. I was torn.

  
THEN. Nsister gets in touch absolutely savaging me and my wife for how we've been. Defending nparents to the hilt. Only, she stupidly tells us that our nparents had been recording the therapy sessions. Each and every one. And had been playing those recordings to her. Sharing deeply personal an intimate conversations. For power and control.

  
Since then, we have gone NC. I cannot even consider being in a room with them again.

  
BUT THEY KEEP SENDING BIRTHDAY CARDS

  
They always made it a ""control"" thing that birthday cards came on time and that you sent it, but this is getting tough. We don't speak, we won't speak,. But they send me and my wife low-effort Moonpig cards. 

Is it just trying to prod us? Is it so they can say ""oh well, we made the effort"". Or is it something else?

  
I want nothing to do with them. But this is messing with me.

  
I'm sorry. I thought I knew how to deal with this :-(

I’ve gained a lot of weight and she berates me every single day about it, not because she wants me to be healthy, but she wants me to be skinny and “pretty” and not embarrass her. She tells me every other day that she wishes she could die so that she’d be free of me. These are the highlights.

1o4nqcj,How do I work towards going no contact?,"TW: mentions of child abuse/neglect

Hi, I(18F) am looking for some **advice on going NC** (eventually). 
I'm currently on a gap year. 
I've thought a lot about going NC with my family when I get older(once I've studied and have a stable job or at least enough money to be on my own).
Seems like it's the only way I'll ever find peace and happiness.

**Q1. How do I work towards going NC?** **(financial documents, bank accounts, imp documents, etc)**

**Q2. How can I ensure that they can't find or track me? (google sharing, social media, email accounts, etc)**


**Basic context**
My mother used to hit me as a child.
My father has emotionally neglected me all my life, outright ignores me half of the time.
They both gang up on me often and verbally abuse and berate me.
I don't deserve that. 

They've also mentioned on multiple occasions that **the only reason they had me was so I could look after them when they get older.**
WTFF??!!!

also, I'm an only child.

Honestly, they've kept me pretty sheltered(especially in the social sense), to the point that I don't know how I could function without them. 
Sometimes I forget to eat because I don’t even recognize when I’m hungry. I'm generally not independent or outspoken, and I guess that makes it easier to keep me closer to them. But I can't keep doing that forever. **I want and need to grow.**

When I try to bring up my mother's behavior, she says that she doesn't remember or that it wasn't a big deal and I'm just overreacting. 


When I try to bring up my father's behavior, he doesn’t believe there’s anything wrong with how he acts, and **he’s never shown interest in becoming a better person.**

I plan to cut them off as soon I become financially stable and independent.
Can't lie, I'm neither of those things right now, but I want to be.

I don't even know where to start(with cutting them off, or being independent).
**I just want to be happy and live in peace.**


**Here are my questions once again:**


**Q1. How do I work towards going NC?** **(being independent, financial documents, bank accounts, imp documents, etc)**

**Q2. How can I ensure that they can't find or track me?**
**(google sharing, social media, email accounts, etc)**

I'd really appreciate any advice you could give me.

1o4mo04,It hurts to break the cycle,"I have 3 kids and it’s important for me to give them a safe childhood, make them feel like they can rely on me, making mistakes is okay, etc, contrary to my own upbringing. And I think we’re doing a good job. But oh, man, sometimes that hurts so much.

Like, I tell them: “you are my favourite [firstname] in the world. There are other [firstname]s out there, and I like them, but you are my absolute favourite.” And then we also explain that for the parents of those children, it is their child who is their favourite [firstname] in the world. Because every parent loves their own children the most and thinks they are the best and most special.

But oh man. Saying that always makes me cry inside. Because I NEVER felt that coming from my parents. But I don’t want to ruin their worldview or make them feel like they’re lucky to have us (e.g. “you should be glad that we love you so much, because not all parents love their children as we love you”) which could make them very anxious to lose us subconsciously.

So I keep telling them those “positive worldview” things that should be true for everyone but never were for me.

1o4mm90,Is this normal parent behavior?,"Things my mother did / keeps doing
 

1.     When I was almost 17 years old, she read my diary (which was hidden in a drawer under different files) when I was not home. Then she told my father about things that were written there and then she was mad at me. She then burned the dairy-notebook (that was important to me and I had written in it a lot) in the fireplace. 

2.     She kept asking about details of my relationships, including very private things. 

3.     When I lived with her, she would smell my underwear or pajamas. 

4.     If I accidentally left my phone unlocked, she would read my messages and go through my phone, no matter how old I was. 

5.     She would never knock on my doors (even when I was already an adult). Many times, she would also try to sneak in (walk very quietly) so I don’t hear her approaching and then suddenly enter the room.

6.     When at doctors (before the age of 18) when I was getting examined and had to undress, she would never look away. 

7.     She always made huge fuss whenever I wasn’t answering a phone (for less than an hour) and would force others (like my father or neighbors) to come check on me.

8.     She would say she wants to unalive herself because of me being a bad daughter whenever I opened up about not feeling well (being depressed). 

9.     She would insist on sleeping with me until I was 18 years old.

10.  She kept sending me fake educational videos on Instagram even though I asked her multiple times not to do this because it makes me feel bad and invalidates my illness.

11.  She claimed I don’t have endometriosis even though I had been diagnosed with severe stage 4 endometriosis by many doctors. 

12.  She would buy me inappropriate clothes that she liked even though I asked her many times not to and that it was not my style.

13.  As a child when I told her any secrets and specifically asked her not to tell anyone she would tell others. 

14.  She would always go through my things and bags, no matter the age (even when being 22+ years old). 

15.  Whenever I was showing her something on my phone and got a message, she would read it so fast and question me about it. 

16.  Whenever I was having a telephone conversation (no matter with whom) she would stand behind my doors and listen. 

17.  When I was living alone, she would call me daily (many times a day) and also ask me to come home often.

18.  She would never let me skip school if I was very sick (I had to go even with 39-degree fever).

19.  She would make me clean the house whenever I was feeling down (like watch all the floors if I ever cried).

20.  She would never listen to my requests (like not opening the window in my room because of mosquitos) and would constantly do those things I told her not to. 

21.  She would force me to go out with her for different events, like cinema or theater even though I hated those (due to introversion and social anxiety) and she knew it well.

22.  She would insist on me and her living close to each other in the future.

23.  She would ask me to hug her often and would guilt trip me whenever I didn’t.

24.  She would ask me to have access to my location through an app. At first, I agreed to that as it might be useful during emergencies but I could see she was checking it every few minutes. Then when I deleted it, I kept getting phone calls from my grandma who was crying saying I am a bad daughter to my mom who loves me so much and that I don’t love her.

25.  Whenever I visited her the first thing, she would say was negative comments about my face (acne).

26.  She would take photos of me randomly that I didn’t like and she wouldn’t delete them even if I asked her to. She would also send those photos to others.

27.  She would post photos of me on Instagram or Facebook that I clearly didn’t like and wouldn’t delete them even though there were some of my classmates following her.

28.  Whenever I got a package or a letter, she would open it first.

29.  She would try talking to me about inappropriate things with details even though I was disgusted by it.

30.  She would talk with my ex-boyfriend (one that I dated for a very short time) behind my back. 

31.  She would talk bad about any friends I had at the time.

32.  She would lie to me very often and claim it was a joke whenever I found out the truth. I never had idea those were jokes since they were not funny and she said them seriously making it sound like truths. 

33.  When I had half-prom in high school, she went behind the building to watch me dance through a window of the dancing hall and would comment on it later.

34.  When I was 16 and met with a friend (in a public and safe place as there were many people) she and my grandmother would both follow me (behind, stalking, and pretending they were not there).

35.  She would go through outdoor monitoring to watch me leave the house, or other guests I had. 

36. I went to a doctor, found out I had shingles and her first reaction when I told her was ""maybe I have it too!” 

Everything I listed is not even being close to the worst things that happened. It’s just examples of simple daily things.

Did anyone else's parents not let you have friends over but let you go over to whoeevers house however often you wanted? And allowed bad things to happen by not asking questions they should have ie. ""Do you allow the children to play completely unsupervised behind a closed door for hours?"" 🙄🙄🙄


Also did anyone have a friend with a traditional family who you went to visit to make it feel like you were part of a ""normal"" family? I loved coming home from school and having a snack ready for us on the table, or having a normal family dinner...

1o4kxvz,"How does one put their foot down, when you've been in a high chair for so long?","Tried posting here before, but it was way too long, so I’m going to try to make this a short as possible.

Not sure if this an actual term, but at least when talking about dysfunctional families, my parents fall under emotionally unavailable father and emotionally unstable mother. Given that both my parents grew up in traditionally Nigerian household, this dynamic doesn’t really surprise me. They don’t go that hard on us with trad stuff, but it definitely informs their beliefs.

Mom: Main trigger noted by uni counselor. Biggest problem is her obsession with codes and symbols. Happened with letter magnets and small woods, if she felt like we put certain numbers or letter out “on purpose”, the stuff would end up on the floor. Felted bullied by others when we had our own church. (Yeah I know) Main thing now is swagbucks, one of those play games earn money sites. (Yes some of them work, no it doesn’t replace a job and it has flaws.) Even though everyone has mentioned she doesn’t have to do, she still insist that everyone is giving her ”codes"" to meet the daily goal. Will beg my siblings and I to help her play games or do surveys. Feels like there's a secret agenda anytime I want to do something.

Dad: difficult to describe. His way or the highway. Main thing is his anger, leads to ""incidents"" but it's not a daily  or even monthly thing. If he agrees with it, will provide financially. Mom argues he should say no more often. No emotional comfort. Once again, trad household, no excuse but simple evidence.

Siblings: Older brother went to military,  will to go to bat for me if I move out in state. Doesn't approve of moving out of state. Other two siblings feel like roommates at this point, no comment. One is a twin, he doesn't think I'm moving out, mf-ing annoying depressed crab having ah.

Last year, I tried to talk about moving out. This lead to months of arguing and sit downs with my mom fear mongering me. Tubi evil lesbian affair trope, ""world isn't the same anymore"", recounting her own incidents in life. Also mentioning I should bring my virginity back home with me, in Yoruba wording or her own, who knows. She added the part of ""bringing it back"" after a couple of weeks ago she state, ""First thing they're going to take is your ""enemys'"" virginity."" Also when stating my case for moving out both parents viewed me mentioning their fighting as an excuse. Dad mentioned how things like that happen in life which angered my mom and lead to them arguing. 

Anyway, tried to do the out of state classes online, but they said I need to be a resident, so that fell through. With the school semester starting again, my dumb self folded and started my second semester at the school less than 20 minutes away from me.

It's October now and I'm trying to keep myself afloat with classes. Doing my best to stay on a steady path, but the depression is eating at me. The question is how do I break free from them? Everyone says to rebel and crash out but how do you do that if you never have? My Dad paid 1.8k for these semester because I didn't get the state grant.

My mom has called my siblings and I to talk about how she can't sleep in the room with my dad anymore. My suggestion is for her to move into the room I share with my sister and I move into a hotel. However, there's no way she and my dad is going to say yes. And I don't know what to do with that. My Dad has my 3k refund from last year, but because I was a late birthday, he took the money. I've ask like two times and he's said no, but he's willing to pay for stuff that is reasonable. I know some parents spend it, but he's just adding money to it like a HYSA, plus he has no need to spend it. I promise I'm not being delusional, his plan is to give after we graduate (has my brother's refund too). 

One again, I don't know what to do, I only have $97 and that's after it takes like 20 days for all money I'm earning to hit my account. It's also a monkey paw that I just got cover draft from my bank.

1o4kf6d,My narcissistic mother is at it again,"29, M

Thankfully I dont live with her anymore. But I really don't understand her headspace or cruelty or just generally why she is like she is. She knows I'm autistic, agoraphobic with cptsd, crippling health anxiety, depression. I'm the kind of person who takes a tablet and then seconds later worries if I've taken it or not. I have a couple of vices, sure. One of which is fizzy drinks, coke/pepsi/dr pepper ect. At most, I drink a 2l a day but that's only when I'm really stressed because it helps chill me out, and yes, I drink it daily because I need something. I don't gamble, I don't smoke, I don't do drugs, I don't vape, I need some sort of stimulus or something to make me feel regulated. So, we have our nightly call and completely unprompted she says that she's read on the Internet that, these numbers can be swapped it's one or the other, that I'm at 300% risk of dementia when I'm older or 200% risk of stroke for drinking fizzy drinks regularly. Going on to say that I don't have to worry because I don't drink that much anymore. I said to her it's like me bringing a shark to her house knowing full well she's afraid of sharks to which she said it's not like that at all. She then went on to say (unprompted and knowing I'm agoraphobic with bad acid reflux and bowel pain at the minute) that i should go bike to my dad's, I'll just call it sale pitch, because it's 'only down the road' 2.5 miles away which i know isn't much for the average person most likely. I live five minutes away. Keep myself to myself. I don't want her in my life anymore, I just don't, she offers to cook me dinners once a week despite knowing I'm either gluten intolerant, lactose intolerant or both and says she won't put milk in or gluten and yet I'll end up with a stomach ache.She berates me constantly if I don't take her advice.

Since I moved out six months ago and wanted to learn more about epilepsy, I asked my mother for the hospital documents from back then. She said she no longer had them, which really upset me. Who throws away such important documents? That's why I had to request the documents again myself. When I finally received the documents and read through them, I suddenly saw that I had taken an IQ test at the age of 8, which showed a result of 116. In addition, my mother informed the treating physician that a “mild form” of ADHD had been diagnosed. That really overwhelmed me. She never told me that. It took me by surprise, especially since I've been wondering lately whether I might be on the autism spectrum. I had never really thought about ADHD before. Now that I know, it fits me very well. Nevertheless, I am convinced that I am also on the autism spectrum. Two days ago, I wrote my mother a long text about it, which she has not yet responded to.

1o4jrak,Gaslighting for getting married,"I feel so drained at the moment. 
About 7 years ago I (W/28) left my parental home and leaved everything behind. My father is a nparent who verbally/physically abused me, my mother and brother for years. My mother and brother tend to back my father for his behavior because of religion and culture. And probably because they don’t want to escalate things.

I left my parental home, lived alone for two years and then moved in with my boyfriend. I immediately went NC with my father. And maybe saw him three times when my mother got sick, but we never really spoke. After all this time, he has never blamed himself for the whole situation (typical narcissist behavior). I always kept contact with my mother, but I realized that even though she says she loves me she takes his back. Living under his control and accepting everything. My brother could move out, because he is a man, and lives kind of a double-life. Not agreeing with him but accepting his behavior. 

After I left my parental home I went in therapy and got treated for 4 years with medication and EMDR for CPTSD and depression. Everything from the past 20 years left a huge scar. 

After 7 years I am ‘happier’. I have a good job, a nice home, two cats and I’m engaged (we have been together for 10 years, my bf has never even seen my father). But I can’t be 100% happy about my engagement because I know it will tear up those old wounds again. I don’t want my father to be there, he has no right for what he has done. I still want my mother and brother there, because they are the only close family I have left. But they are making it such a hard time. 

Today my mom said that my engagement announcement is my own problem and she and my brother agreed that it is my responsibility to tell my father about it. Otherwise she is not sure if she and my brother are able to come to my wedding. My father throws tantrums about anything and may even forbid them to go. She also mentioned that because I left 7 years ago they had to deal with my father because of my behavior. It being such a hard time for them and I’m only thinking about myself… I feel gaslighted. 

I’m exhausted. Planning a wedding should be something lovely and nice because of it being such a new milestone. But I’m only just avoiding it because of the consequences of the old wounds that will be ripped open again. It’s triggering. I just wanted to vent. Thank you for reading.

I’ve read so many things that they pick on weak minded people with no boundaries… but those people just blend in with the crowd and don’t stand out in any way.. so that just doesn’t make sense. 

Edit: I’ve been called bold strong and confident and I’m a magnet for them. I think they go after whatever is attractive — they find ways around strong boundaries and gradually erode them. I doubt that they go after people with weak boundaries — loads of people have weak boundaries and never get targeted. They clearly like the strong ones with talents etc.

1o4jb1m,My mom pressures me to do what she wants and then says I should thank her for it,"Hi everyone,

I’d like some perspective on my situation with my mother. I live in another country now — there are four countries between us — but she still tries to control many aspects of my life. She tells me how my house should look, what kind of work I should do, and what decisions I should make.

She’s never supportive of the things that come from me. She only praises me when I do something that was her idea. When I follow my own path or create something I care about, she criticizes it or acts like it’s meaningless.

What really confuses me is how she always presents herself as the “good mother.” Whenever she pressures me into doing something I don’t want to do, she later says how thankful I must be that she “made me do it.” She’ll say things like, “You’re lucky to have me, aren’t you?” or “Say thank you mom!” and then I have to thank her for pushing me into a life that is not mine otherwise i am ""ungreatful"". 

She makes it sound like she’s doing everything for my benefit, but the truth is, I end up giving in just to avoid her anger or guilt-tripping. Then she turns it into proof of what a great mom she is.

Recently, I told her about a personal project I’m working on — a self-discovery and emotional journal I’ve been creating with a lot of love and effort. She immediately said it wouldn’t sell, and that there are already too many books like that. She didn’t even want to see it.

I’m wondering if this is narcissistic behavior — the control, the lack of support, and the way she twists everything so that she’s always right and I’m the “grateful” one. Has anyone else experienced this kind of dynamic?

My sister who went from scapegoat to golden child sent my parents screenshots of my posts in this sub where I described being abused. Now my dad tells me I’m a liar and was never abused.

I know he’s misguided and wish I could get him to see reality. Today I learned in my state (and others) it’s considered neglect to fail to protect your kids from an unstable person, even if that other person is the other parent. My dad is fine on his own but with her he’s a henchman.

1o4h8yu,Letter I'll never send to my Narc Aunt TW: Child Abuse/SA,"To my Aunt,

While you did not physically abuse me, you played a key role in tearing my family apart.

You are the reason I had to learn how to grow up as a single child even though I had an older sister somewhere out there in the world I wasn't allowed to see.

Yes, my dad abused us and molested us. 

But you... You made an already fucked up situation for two little girls who weren't even 10 years old that much worse.. all because you had to play the savior in your story where you're the main character.

So you woke my sister up in the middle of the night when we stayed at your house and you sat her in front of the TV with the blue screen on and you whispered things to her. I saw you. I heard you. Isn't that why you yelled at me to go back to sleep when I asked why my sister wasn't in bed? 

She was easy for you to control. I wasn't. That's why you manipulated her into lying about our mother and claiming our mother also took part in the abuse. So you could get the courts to side with you and your police officer husband into awarding custody of her to you. Isn't that why you had him show up to the court hearing, off-duty and outside his jurisdiction, in his police uniform? To sway the judge in your favor? 

But if our mother was so bad, if my mother was so unfit, why did they only remove one child from the home and not the other? Cause it was all bullshit!

My sister might have had a chance to grow up normal, she could have had a chance to heal from her trauma and recover like I did. But thanks to you, she'll never live a normal life. She is forever mentally 12 years old, she is emotionally still the same age she was when I last saw her as a child. She is trapped at that age because you only cared about how you could best use her to feed your main character syndrome.

But you could barely control your own three boys; what made you think you could control a growing little girl who experienced extremely traumatizing abuse at the hands of her own father? Did you think she wouldn't eventually realize that you lied to her and used her?

So you abandon her to be raised in the system instead of getting her the help she needed like you told the judge you could.

And I had to grow up never allowed to contact my sister. I wasn't even allowed to hug her in the court room!

All so you could be the fucking main character.

So, dear aunt, I hope you enjoy tomorrow's family reunion. I won't be there this time either, but I'm sure you'll be the center of attention like you always are.

Sincerely,
Your niece

1o4h4yp,How did you handle moving out of your n parents home?,"A bit of a rant.

I (22f) and my bf (22m) have been in a relationship for 5 years and want to move out as most couples do. My parents have pretty much raised me to never leave the house because they might need me to take care of something, and leaving meant I was too selfish to think about my family. Recently, I have been going out with friends more and more, but they still yell at me if I am home past 9 bc I need to do chores that can for some reason only be done at night. Mind you, I have a younger sibling (18nb) who stays at home all the time, but they never ask them to do chores. 

Bringing up apartments was a nightmare as you can imagine. I was hit daily with “you’d rather waste money on an apartment when you live rent free here?” and “you know we have health issues and don’t want to take care of us”. My grandparents (they live with us) also have health issues, and my parents are taking to telling them their version of events (I can’t speak their native language) and guilt tripping me over the anguish that their unmarried grandchild is leaving the family home. They don’t try to persuade me against it, but seeing them cry does hurt me and my parents know this. 

My bf’s parents’ house has a separate in law unit that they were mainly using as storage, and they offered it to us after hearing about my family troubles. They encouraged us to save for a house since it was the smart thing to do and wouldn’t charge us rent given that obviously we take care of the space. Now that money wasn’t the issue, it was “so you like men who can’t buy you a house” and “why chose his family over your own?”. 

I’ve tried over and over to explain how our relationship is developing and that we need to take things more seriously before we waste each other’s time not exploring common hardships. I love my bf and am confident he’s the one, and he’s been so patient with my situation, but I still feel like it’s important to experience how compatible we are living together before marriage and buying a house. My parents dismiss this and insist their marriage worked so I don’t need to do any of that if I’m truly confident he’s the one.

Between the heartache of seeing my sweet grandparents cry, the guilt tripping of needing to care for family health issues, and the constant gaslighting that I don’t know what I’m talking about and should listen to people who have years of experience over me, I broke slightly and caved to staying only one night a week. This has lessened the verbal battering slightly, but the anxiety of the upcoming day I leave for that single night gets worse the closer it is. The following days have me in panic of needing to make sure I get as many chores and extra acts of service done as possible to make them as “happy” as they can be before leaving. My departure will still be met with a passive “pretending to move out again, she only thinks about herself”. 

Now here’s the messed up part: for some reason I still love my parents. When things were good, they were good, and I really don’t want to cut contact with my parents if I can help it. I feel like moving in with him without a house of our own will result in them cutting me off because I made the bad decision of “choosing a man who can’t give me the bare minimum”. This is the first time I really rebelled on any level, and I was a pretty obedient and well behaved kid growing up. Losing contact with my parents would also mean losing my sibling and grandparents, whom I have good relationships with. None of them will anger my parents for my sake, so keeping contact with them is impossible if I’m not on good terms with my parents. 

How would you guys handle this?

1o4gqe5,"If the phrase ""Wipe that smirk off your face"" makes you feel anxious and sad, you had a narc parent.","Most of my memories of being ""disciplined"" for anything and everything include my parents saying ""wipe that smirk off your face"" I definitely was NEVER smirking while being berated and abused as far as I know.. I always felt fear and uncertainty knowing physical violence was on the horizon. So why was this always said to me by both my narc parents? Anyone else experience this? I had a somewhat happy disposition as a kid (surprisingly- just born that way) and I learned not to look too content or happy around my parents, especially if they were angry, as it triggered them.. but, did they say this to try to condition me to look sad, or was it more due to their emotional immaturity and envy of a positive disposition. I was born highly empathetic and caring, complete opposite of them and my siblings, so was that the reason? I was born last, and my siblings were much older, already toxic and copying their abusive behavior.. they never got told this, or even disciplined at all.. I was punished for everything they did, and they learned to say ""she did it"" and I got beat without question. They would even do things on purpose just to frame me... I know now that was just a survival tactic for them, but their empathy was non-existent. They would smile as I got beat for ""smiling"" Super confusing childhood. I got beat a lot for ""leaving the lights on"" yet I wasn't even tall enough to reach the light switch. I even remember testing if I could reach after most beatings just to make sure reality was reality. The ""smirk"" may have been a result of me already knowing my parents were not normal and would repeat their abuse regardless of my behavior. I did feel fear, but definitely was never smiling or smirking... I didn't respect them at all for how they acted though... So was that what they saw in me, or were they just repeating what they were told as kids? My siblings were NEVER punished and they are now drug addicts and criminals, so everything in my childhood was backwards and confusing. My oldest sister recently told me most of her trauma came from watching ME get beat as a toddler.. wild to think about.

1o4gbgd,curious about my mother,"soo, often, i read through this subreddit and i question if my mom is a narcissist or somebody with multiple narcissistic tendencies…so, i wanted to provide some examples and see what you all think!

for the majority of my life, pretty much every day of the week revolved around cleaning, which led to beatings if it wasn’t done by the time a timer went off..

2. as i came to find out, my mother spent over 100k in child support on herself (international trips, a wedding, multiple purses and clothing articles..electronics..etc) which left my siblings and i with completely neglected dental and overall health

3. during my childhood, we weren’t allowed to speak our minds regarding any topics lest we be punished (with beatings). during one instance in which i retaliated, i had to sit infront of the fire place until my step father got home, and during that waiting period i was berated with insults which ultimately led to another beating! 

4. put me on medications completely unrelated to my actual diagnosis, which i only came to find out later on…

5. conspired with my therapist in order to have me go live with my abusive biological father, which also included violation of hipaa..

and of course, much more. point is, i look at some of the posts that i see here and i question if my mom is a narcissist or if she’s just a deeply evil person through and through. i wonder because, i feel like im claiming a community i can’t really say im apart of, and i don’t know how to feel about that.

1o4ebff,Is it strange how I relate to a disgraced fighter pilot? Does anybody feel like they are also feeling like a Soviet fighter pilot in the midst of nparent chaos?,"Context of the incident I am talking about:

[한국기자 20년 만의 최초 인터뷰-KAL 007기 격추 소련 요격기 조종사 오시포비치 : 월간조선](https://monthly.chosun.com/client/news/viw.asp?nNewsNumb=200311100020)

Heads up (this is in Korean so get Google Translate ready) but tldr (fighter pilot is made to shoot down a spy plane which turns out to be an ordinary civilian plane. the officer who gave the order is promoted to head of the Russian Airforce while the fighter pilot who actually shot it down is left to burn on a 200$ pension.)

okay now onto why I think that this is relevant. I 20f, am a first-generation college student and because I am the daughter of Egyptian immigrants, I essentially have been raised to never question authority. EVER. When I first learned about KAL007, and when I got to learn about the dynamics between the three Soviet officers involved in the shootdown incident, I almost saw myself in Gennadi Nikolayevich Osipovich (9/25/1944-9/23/2015).

I know it might seem very strange that I would liken myself to a fighter pilot who inadvertently slaughtered 269 innocent people but hear me out. If you look at the conversation between Osipovich's commanding officers Anatoly Kornukov (1942-2014) and Valerei Kamensky, you can see how even though the latter suggested only shooting down the aircraft AFTER it was verified to be a reconassiance aircraft. However Kornukov refused to do this and ordered Osipovich to fire on the plane even if it did cross back into international airspace. ff to the aftermath of KAL007, in the 1990s Kornukov was later promoted to the head of the Russian airforce before retiring from the position in the 2000s. Gennadi was left to burn on nightmares and a 200$ pension and was made into the scapegoat of the catastrophe. For following orders and is then blamed for the consequences.

Now, why do I relate to this disgraced military officer? Now let me tell you one quick story. This happened just 7 weeks ago or so just before I commenced my junior year of college. After I ended up being disqualified for the major I actually wanted (that story is for another time), my parents decided to step in despite the fact that they don't understand the US higher education system (like at all really). For a while they were very hyped up about me going into psychology but only because I'm autistic. That's it. That was literally their logic. They even made me sign up for a biology course in order to qualify for the major. Although I would ultimately get the needed grade about halfway through the course, my father found a leaflet on my bedroom floor for the information studies major. (I only picked this up because my parents were suggesting I go into this major and decided to pick it up only out of casual curiosity not pure interest) He then suggested I go into the info studies major and ditch psychology. However this was just 6 days before the major declaration deadline. So I didn't have time to think about it of course. When I wasn't able to register for classes because of the hold on my account, my parents exploded at me and even threatened to take a conservatorship over me because I was ""irresponsible"". In order to register for the semester, I actually had to file an exception request to stay undeclared for one more semester which was fortunatly accepted. But while I was waiting for my request decision from my advising college, my parents were constantly nagging me about the worst case scenario, even though they were the primary party responsible considering that it was their idea for me to go into information studies at the 11th hour. But it does beat being catch 22ed into shooting down a plane any day.

So to my fellow scapegoats who were catch22ed into shitty situations, were there ever times you felt like Osipovich? Let me know in the comments.

TLDR, she spent my entire life trying to gaslight me into thinking the csa that happened when I was a child actually happened to the 'child of a friend of hers', so any memories I have of it are were because it's a story she told. I have never confronted her about this, I don't have any desire to. I know she'll deny it, so there's no point.

It wasn't until I met my husband and he moved across the country to live with me that I started to see that things I thought were normal were not, in fact, normal (I'm sure a lot of you can relate). And after a bit of therapy and a lot of love and support from my husband, I went NC with her and her son, along with her son's wife.

She tried to contact me several times throughout the years and each time, my husband was there to support me through it, to offer me comfort, and to assure me I was safe.

On September 11th, my husband of 15 years passed away after a year long, horrible battle with cancer. He passed away in the morning.

That very night, my 'brother's' wife contacted me on facebook to tell me she's 'there for me' if I ever need her.

Y'all, if I took the time to tell you about how awful this woman in specific was to my husband, you would throw a pillow at the wall.

That's kind of why I'm here. See, before, my husband was always the one to comfort me when these people tried to worm their way into my life. But now he's gone and no one in my life really understands what its like to have an nParent/nSibling. And yeah, I could tell them, but it's not the same if you haven't experienced it.

So I wanted to make a venting post because since that day they have tried several more times to contact me, including through the one aunt I trusted to not try and connect us. And I have no one to talk to about this. (I'm working on getting a therapist, insurance is an issue atm.)

She basically hung up on my sister after my sister said I love you and she never even said it back. Today I went to go visit her after I got off work and she basically was just like saying one word answers wouldn't even look me in the face. I asked her if she wanted me there visiting her and she basically just Shrugged her shoulders. And then I asked her if she wanted me there in the morning before her surgery and she just nodded yes.

I don't know whether I should give her more grace, because what she's going through is pretty terrible. But she's kind of been a b**** my whole life and isn't any better now. Maybe in typing this out I already have my answer. I think I just wanted to wait around for the moment to come where she would be all sentimental and we would be happy. But now that I'm just typing this all out I don't think we'll ever get there.

1o4dn47,Tiny seemingly innocuous comments throwing me into a loop / agony,"Long story short, I live abroad and so does a lot of my family including my narc brother and narc wife live in a different country to me. My narc brother and his wife were planning to go back at the start of this year, and I didn't think I would, because I visited home and my brother the year before to celebrate my birthday and pay my respects. I ended up having to do a last minute trip for a good friend's wedding though, and said that I wouldn't be going back for a while to take a break from international travel and save money. My narc brother thought they might go back for Christmas this year, but even a couple of weeks ago when I spoke to them they said not sure yet, so I figured it might not happen.

My father's birthday is next week, so I figured I'd try do something nice and call them this weekend, to catch up first, then a birthday call next week, because he'll prob be busy.

Needless to say the call got hi-jacked by narc mom, and started asking me what my Christmas plans were this year, since I'd already told them a bunch of times I \*should\* have seen this as a red flag, but re-iterated I was taking a year off travel. She then started talking about my narc brother's birthday (who is the golden child) as he's having his 40th, and hinting they were having a party and wanted me to come. Although I felt a bit of pressure and slight guilt tripping, I didn't worry too much as I just said what I'd been saying before. We talked about a whole range of things and convo was dragging on, so I tried to wrap up after an hour, but then nmom, brought up the birthday again and made sure I definitely wasn't coming for the birthday. Added note that I hadn't heard about these birthday plans from anyone before and it's less than 2 months out. But she made a point that she was ""going to inform my narc sister in law I wouldn't make it"" Which struck me as a bit odd at the time, but weighed on me throughout the day--why my narc sister in law and not my narc brother? Is she the one organizing? And I began to get super uncomfortable about them talking behind my back and guilting me later, and I was so angry at myself for not clarifying at the time or asking what she meant, or even being alert enough to stick up for myself and state why it would be difficult to even organize anything in this short 1 month window.

To clarify, I feel like despite the fact I tried to protect myself and communicated plans in advance, I'm being 'one-upped' being labelled as the one not showing up and being a let down because these plans have changed. I couldn't help but think that the way it was brought up and the framing of it makes my nmum just evil. 

I became so angry with myself, my nmom for bringing this up, God and everyone. It seems like an innocent statement -- ""i'll tell your sister in law"" but the nuances are weighing on me very heavily. I almost couldn't sleep last night and I feel like a wreck.

Objectively, I know it doesn't make sense for me to feel this weigh as by most standards making international travel plans for in a month is unreasonable, but I'm so so angry at myself for not being more on my guard, sticking up for myself instead of just saying ""okay"" and even angry that I decided to call them a week in advance--if I had of waited till next week, and just given a birthday call to my dad, it likely wouldn't have been brought up, and maybe a few weeks later they would have mentioned by which time it would have been impossible.

I'm angry because I try to live my life right, do right by others, do the right things, not live too much with my guard up, but it just kicks my ass.

I'm wondering if any others can relate to this tiny comment and my reaction to it and give any perspective.

I also wonder if it's common to feel this rotten. It's hard to describe, but I feel gross, unclean, defiled, violated, irritated, angry, stressed and feel like I'm aging in real time. While the last one might be an exaggeration, I don't know how to describe this feeling, but I feel like my soul and energy has been stolen--it's super intense, and I'm wondering if anybody else feels similarly? It may sound self-centered of me to say, but sometimes I wonder if anyone feels this intensity as much as myself for such a seemingly trivial thing.

1o4di0f,"After going no contact, I finally found peace. Should I ever reopen it?","I’ve had panic attacks for as long as I can remember: starting in kindergarten, when I’d sometimes eat lunch alone in the nurse’s office. My mother could be cold one minute and explosive the next. There was never a comforting hug, never empathy. She lied pathologically about big things, small things, everything, until I couldn’t trust a word she said. She would throw things, yell, and criticize everything. She’d pick fights with cashiers, her friends would come and go, and she would tell me not to talk about our “family secrets.”

When I was about five, I remember crying on the couch from the pain of a vaccine shot. Instead of comforting me, she dismissed me, irritated, and kept talking on the phone. She didn’t attend parent-teacher conferences or my 5th-grade maturation program, and she once prevented me from going to my best friend’s birthday party because she was mad at my friend’s mom.

She constantly accused my dad of cheating while she herself was cheating on him. She only admitted it when she was finally caught on camera. I would catch her having secret conversations with men, and even as a child, I knew she was lying about who she was talking to. During our summers in Mexico without my dad, I once saw her jump on the back of a motorcycle with another man in the middle of the night, even as I called out for her, leaving her kids behind. I must have been about six or seven.

She was constantly threatening divorce. I remember, as a little girl, being sat down every once in a while and told that she and my dad were going to divorce, and she would ask which parent I would want to live with. In hindsight, I see now that it was a manipulation tactic meant to hurt my dad.

As I got older, the chaos and confusion didn’t stop, it just changed shape. As a teenager, I started buying my own clothes because she rarely did. Yet I remember walking into her closet and seeing it packed with brand-new clothes, many still with the tags on. I couldn’t understand why she would spend so much on herself but not on me.

Home was unpredictable. My older brother, who had been her scapegoat, grew up to be a teenager with violent rages. He got into bloody fights with my dad, stabbed him in the head with a pen, and once chased us with a knife. The police came more than once. He became addicted to OxyContin and years later, my younger sister did too. I remember feeling constantly in fight-or-flight mode, walking on eggshells, and somehow trained myself to forget things that weren’t okay to minimize them as “not a big deal.”

She created toxicity everywhere. Only recently did I begin to understand that my mom likely orchestrated and fueled these conflicts behind the scenes, pitting my family against each other like pawns so she could maintain control and play the “victim.”

Fortunately, my dad was someone I could count on. He was the one who took me to and attended school programs and conferences with me: the moments my mom couldn’t be bothered with. Though now, as an adult, he’s admitted that he often worked extra hours just to avoid coming home and was told my a therapist early in their marriage (after she had walked out of couples counseling) that the therapist believed she had NPD.

Despite everything, I tried to build a good life. It helped that I was the “golden child.” I learned to be self-reliant early. I got straight A’s in school, started babysitting jobs at 12, got a waitressing job at 15, bought my own clothes, car, and braces as a teen, and earned a scholarship to a community college. I tried to be the “good kid,” doing everything I could to keep her emotionally “happy” and to make her “proud” of me. I realize now I was just trying to earn her love.

In 2015, I was happily married (still am), pregnant with my first child, and living in the home my husband bought while building a real estate career. My dad had finally filed for divorce, and around the same time, my mom was fired from her job. I didn’t know what I know now. I was worried about her. She had nobody else, and I had been conditioned my whole life to “take care” of her emotional needs and to make sure she was okay.

So, I quit a decently successful real estate career, a career I had built on my own, and opened a business with her. Looking back, I realize it was a decision made out of survival conditioning. I was conditioned to step in as her emotional and financial caretaker, not her business partner.

Being in business with her quickly became one of the most stressful experiences of my life. I started seeing behavior I had forgotten about. The same chaos I grew up with bled into the business: favoritism, scapegoating, triangulation, gossip, blaming, gaslighting, manipulation, passive-aggressiveness, paranoia, and constant drama. She refused to do any job except her own position, treating anything else as beneath her, while simultaneously belittling and undermining my decisions, micromanaging team members in jobs she had never worked, and creating constant turnover. Team members confided in me that they never knew “which version” of her they’d face and were always walking on eggshells.

I tried to convince her to work other positions, work from home, anything to keep her toxicity out of the business. She would always refuse. And that was that.

Depending on the drama of the day caused by her, many times I would come home in tears and tell my husband I wanted to throw in the towel, sell everything, and move far, far away. But logically, walking away wasn’t fair. I wasn’t the one causing the problems. I also knew I’d worked too hard to abandon the business I had built and kept together. I had built all the systems around her position. It had become my livelihood. Later, even my husband became employed by the business (working from home).

The problem was, I held on to hope. I constantly tried to justify and explain her behavior as “old school” or just poor leadership. But the mistakes and chaos kept repeating. I couldn’t understand why she seemed to almost enjoy watching me frantically clean up her messes. There were moments I’d convince myself she had changed. I’d come home and tell my husband, “I think she’s finally changed.” He’d say, “No, she hasn’t.” And he was always right. Every calm period was just the eye of the storm before the next cycle when her mask would come off.

Then, in 2023, I started therapy for my lifelong panic attacks. They had become unbearable. I thought they were caused solely by the abuse I had suffered from my older brother. To help myself heal, I finally told my mom the truth about the abuse. I told her because she kept pushing for family get-togethers, and I didn’t feel safe. I needed her to understand that he had abused me in every way: emotionally, physically, and sexually, and that I couldn’t be around him. Through one crocodile tear, she said she’d respect that boundary and that I’d only have to see him again at her funeral. Again, it became about her.

That promise didn’t last.

As therapy progressed, the fog began to lift. I started to see how my panic attacks weren’t just about what my brother did. They were the result of a lifetime of emotional and psychological abuse from her. The guilt, lies, gaslighting, manipulation, unpredictable rage, and lack of empathy: therapy gave language to what I had lived. I realized that she wasn’t just “difficult”; she had a personality disorder. I hadn’t truly seen it until then. This was later confirmed by my dad, who told me that early in their marriage, a therapist had said she appeared to have narcissistic personality disorder.

By that point, the business had become unbearable for the last time. When I came back from a vacation, half my team wanted to quit. The environment had become so toxic in just a matter of days, but this wasn’t the first time. My team would tell me she acted like a completely different person when I wasn’t around. It was the same pattern I had seen for years: she would create tension between employees, dismiss official HR reports about her behavior, and play the victim while gaslighting me whenever I confronted her.

After learning that people with her personality disorder rarely change, and that it’s the hope of their change that keeps you trapped, I decided to finally put my needs before hers. My choice was to either sacrifice my livelihood (I have kids to raise), stay in emotional servitude to her for many years to come, or convince her to retire. I needed to set myself free from the cycle. With the encouragement and advice of my own team members, I finally had the courage to take her to mediation in hopes she would recognize the damage she had caused and agree to retire.

At the first mediation, I couldn’t help but cry as I tried to explain the situation to the mediator. I couldn’t understand how she refused to own up to anything, despite the written proof from many parties, and instead blamed me and everyone else. Had she been anyone else: a husband, a sister, a friend, I never would have tolerated that behavior for so long. I only did because she was my mother. I realized that for the sake of my health, my business, and my team, she had to retire. Surprisingly, during that mediation, she agreed to retire and meet with a mutual attorney to complete the process.

Afterward, she completely flipped the plan. She got her own lawyer. And then came the personal betrayal that changed everything. She flew to Texas to visit my brother and added him, my abuser, to our business bank account, giving him digital access to the company finances. He also has a criminal record. When I got the bank notification and confirmed this, I called her. She played the victim, put my brother on speakerphone, and claimed she had made him her power of attorney.

To her, it was about control. To me, it was betrayal on a level I didn’t think possible. She knew exactly what she was doing. After I had confided in her about my abuse, she gave my abuser access to my livelihood. It was her way of saying that no boundary of mine was real. That she still had power over me.

That was the moment everything clicked. The fog, the panic attacks, the constant chaos: it all made sense. I had opened my eyes. My mother was not going to change. Ever.

I let her know we were done on a personal level. I went no contact and communicated only through legal channels.

We set a second mediation date.

Preparing for the second mediation was oddly therapeutic, though I would get angry at myself for not seeing that it had been emotional and psychological abuse sooner. I went through more than a hundred employee files, old emails and texts, video surveillance, and put together over 240 exhibits showing years of manipulation and dysfunction. It’s hard to explain this kind of toxicity to anyone who hasn’t lived it. It’s like describing fog. You can’t see how thick it is until you finally step outside it.

And while I was gathering proof of her behavior, she was already starting a smear campaign: Lying to my little sister that I had “planned this all along,” that I had stolen from her, and that I was just greedy. It was surreal. I was busy piecing together years of evidence to protect myself and the business, while she was busy rewriting the story to make me the villain.

At the second and last mediation, we stayed in separate rooms. She had invited my brother’s wife to fly out and be there with her last minute, and she tried to get me to agree to stay in business with her, insisting she would not retire. I told the mediator it was impossible for me to be in business with someone I do not trust. It wasn’t until I said I would rather close the business and start my own (my team was going to follow me, and I had the advantage of understanding 100% of the business when she only understood her role) that she finally started talking numbers.

I had come prepared with a third-party appraisal from a forensic accounting company. I agreed to pay her the highest justifiable price, because it wasn’t about the money. It was about my freedom, my health, and my livelihood. And at almost 8:30 PM, I walked out with a signed settlement agreement. She never even saw my face.

Since then, I’ve learned that grief doesn’t just come from death. It comes from accepting that the person you wanted your mother to be never really existed. The “best versions” of her were just a mask. And it’s complicated, because she has a public persona that’s nice, charismatic, and charming. People adore that version of her. But that version isn’t real. You only see who she truly is when you get close enough to see behind closed doors.

Years of chronic stress caught up with me physically, as I had suspected they would. A couple of months after mediation, I was diagnosed with a prolactinoma (a pituitary brain tumor), which I link to long-term emotional strain and chronic stress. My body was trying to warn me something wasn't right. It explained all the headaches I’d get during conflict. I had always sensed that staying in business with her would make me sick, and the diagnosis confirmed it. Fortunately, with about two years of medication, the tumor will go away. I’m lucky. I honestly thought it was something worse.

I am still making payments to her, paying well above the value shown in multiple appraisals, just to have peace. Part of the settlement agreement required that I get approved for an SBA loan. The first loan did not come in at the amount she wanted, and the second one came in at the same value. By that point, I had already paid her down significantly, so the loan now covers the remaining balance. She continued trying to manipulate through the lawyers, but I learned not to engage. She fought me every step of the way, but I did it!!! Now I am waiting for her to sign the purchase agreement required by the SBA. If she does not, no sweat. I will just continue making direct payments to her until she is fully paid off in a few years.

Now, a little more than a year later, I’m learning what peace feels like. I am getting used to it. It isn’t temporary. It is quiet, steady, and safe.

She’s still the grandmother of my two kids and sends gifts through third parties for special occasions. But sometimes I still wonder: should I ever reopen contact with my mother? How long will I stay no contact? And if I stayed no contact, when they pass, do I go to the funeral, or protect my peace even then?

TL;DR:
I grew up with a narcissistic, emotionally abusive mother:  no empathy, constant chaos, and manipulation. She cheated on my dad, lied about everything, and pitted family members against each other. As an adult, I opened a business with her out of “survival conditioning,” which became a replay of my childhood dysfunction. In therapy, I realized my lifelong panic attacks were from her abuse, not just from my brother (who also abused me). After I told her that, she betrayed me by adding him, my abuser, to our business bank account. I went no contact, took her to mediation, and bought her out at a loss just to have peace. She’s still trying to manipulate from a distance, but for the first time in my life, I finally feel real peace. Now I wonder: would you ever reopen contact after finding peace like this? Would you even go to the funeral?

1o4dci9,I don't have a single baby picture of myself.,"*I shared this on another subreddit, but realized that this is probably where people will truly understand. My story is about neglect, emotional manipulation, and the guilt of trying to set boundaries with parents who never showed love without conditions.*

I don't have a single baby picture of myself. Not one. By the time I was old enough to ask ""why"", I already knew the answer. My mom left me in Nigeria before I turned one. She visited, at most, two weeks a year until I moved to the States at 13. I grew up invisible, sometimes abused, and almost died of a chronic illness when I was nine. When I finally joined my parents in the U.S, I thought things would get better. They got worse

My parents always wanted a son. My sisters and I were never enough. That inadequacy was unspoken but constant, a weight we carried in silence.

Years later, they adopted a boy - the son they always wanted. Today, that boy is back in Nigeria, where it's ""cheaper"" to raise a kid, while my parents continue to live comfortably in America. They are doing to him what they did to me, and I have no power to stop the cycle.

They never supported me emotionally and barely financially. The day before my first day of college, my mom was supposed to take me shopping for supplies. Instead, she went to a party. I cried my heart out, and my parents ignored me. The next day, I was sent off to school with no hug, no encouragement, no acknowledgment that I was beginning a new chapter of my life.

Depression followed me through college. I paid out of pocket for therapy before my mom did not sign the form that would have put me under her health insurance. My dad refused to cosign a student loan. Till today, I still wonder why.

During breaks, I stayed in an empty dorm - even on Thanksgiving. I worked summer jobs that allowed me to remain on campus because the campus was more home than home ever was.

After graduation, I crashed with a friend because my mom and I weren't speaking. At one point, she even turned my sisters against me. I'd never felt so completely alone.

So I built a life anyway. I eventually created the stability I never had - a home, a family, a future I could count on. I did it without their encouragement, without their financial support, without a safety net. And somehow, that made me strong enough to survive, but not strong enough to let go.

In my culture, there's an unspoken rule: Parents give you life, so you owe them everything, forever. There's no word for ""boundaries"" - only ""duty"". Questioning this means you're selfish. Ungrateful. A bad child.

But what do you owe parents who were never really there?

Now that I'm older and ""successful"", they are more ""accepting"" of me and act nicer when i give them money - but it's never enough. Love has always been conditional. Any money has always been the measure.

But i have a family of my own to support now. I have financial obligations. I want to make sure I'm secure in my own old age so I'll never have to depend on my children the way my parents depend on theirs. I don't want to keep giving money that goes unappreciated. I don't want to keep hearing about ""other children"" who supposedly do more for their parents.

I feel trapped between obligation, guilt, and wanting peace. I want to cut ties, but cultural pressure and guild keep me stuck. I dread the unknown aftermath, the judgement and silent treatment from other family members, the possibility that walking away might bring me peace, but also pain I'm not yet ready to face.

I don't know how to move forward. This is my cry for help.

1o4c5ws,How to keep healthy boundaries with toxic parents that keep crossing them ? How do you cope with guilt of causing your mom depression ?,"Hi guys! It’s gonna be a bit long sorry but I need your advice if you’ve been/are in a similar position. 


Context : I (32F) have always had a difficult and conflictual relationship with my parents. With time it’s gotten a bit better with my dad but worsened with my mom. I believe her to be a narcissist even though it’s hard to give an etiquette like this, I’m not an expert. I’ve been through a lot of therapy these past years and it opened my eyes on how I actually really suffered growing up with them. 
I was neglected emotionally (I had a depression when I was 16 and my mom couldn’t care less about it when I told her I didn’t feel fine). She once, after a fight that we had, made me believe she had cancer so that I would speak again with her (she confessed 30 sec later it was a lie). 
She still has been a good mom in other ways, she was kind of the « bestie mom » I could tell everything to, she made our relationship very fusional. That’s what’s most difficult about it, not everything is bad. But through therapy I understood that how I was raised was not ok, I was raised as an extension of my mom, she didn’t understand I had needs and wants of my own and really tried to impose everything she wanted on me. And for that she used manipulation, persistance (to the point it felt like harassment), lying. But all in a very sweet way. So that when I would burst out of anger, she would then victimize herself and tell me she only wants my happiness as a mom and she doesn’t deserve my being fed up. I clearly was the scape goat in my family (as my brother started to bully me the same way my dad did) so I left their home at 18 (with still contact with them and coming back in between me moving cities for studies) 

Problem : since a few years ago, I moved out from my country. I still had contact with them at first but even though my mom knew how pissed off it would make me to bring up this subject, she couldn’t stop always asking me to come back « home ». She insists and insists. I noticed a pattern that everytime I would share with her I felt happy because I had sth good going on for me, that’s when she would tell me to come back home. She tries to guilt trip me with that. 
So 2 years ago I really cut contact. Because I felt like having her in my life was hindering my growing up as an adult and really finding out what I wanted from life (I had always been an over achiever to shine in the eyes of my mom and for her to brag about it to others). In between we tried reconnecting but I slowly realized it’s impossible, she doesn’t change. She lies, she manipulates, she never admits she’s wrong and never apologizes. She tries to guilt trip me very insidiously. She’s really good at playing victim and making me look like the bad guy that’s ungrateful towards all that she did for me in life (without having to say it). Anyways I’ve been no contact for almost a year now. Last time I came back in the city we’re from (but not their house, they have another apartment I stay at because they are not there), she sent me a message to ask if she could see me, I said I was not ready. This time she knocked on my door directly without asking. I’m so mad. She said « well last time you refused by message so I figured I would come directly » and she doesn’t even see how wrong it is. She wanted me to see her sad so I could soften up and let her in. My parents always knew I was more sensitive and abused it. They never changed cause they knew I would always forgive and move on. But now I just can’t anymore. 

Am I tripping guys ??? Is it just how families are and I should me more flexible/understanding? Or have you been in a similar situation and how do you keep your boundaries when they keep being crossed ? I’m just so tired because on top of grieving parents that were never really parents, I now feel deep guilt as they grow older and they put me in situations where I keep having to say no. Recently I noted that they are slowly indirectly guilt tripping me for my mother’s depression.

1o4bmdt,Why does leaving hurt so bad?,"This is just a rant lol. I’m all over the place

A little over a month ago I disappeared from the house. My nmom went on vacation so I used that as a time to leave. I packed all my things and left on the morning she was coming back. It’s so weird. Because I don’t miss her at all. The longer I’m away the more memories come back. I’m sure I’ve blocked lots of it out as well. I’ve always struggled with depression, at least since my early teens. I find that it’s almost worse now tho. Even when things got hard I managed to find a way to keep pushing. I don’t know where I got that drive from. Or how to get it back. I’ve done almost nothing the past bit. I feel lazy and like I’m not contributing to anything. Or going anywhere. I currently have no plans. I don’t know what to do with myself. It’s like o never thought I’d leave and so I didn’t bother planning a life. I also feel so scattered and like I’m all over the place. I broke down in front of my bf earlier because I wrote a note explaining how I feel. I have no clue how to vocalize those feelings. Even if I try I just cannot get them out. The only way I’ve been able to express myself like that is by writing it. It’s as if I have no communication skills. I keep holding things in that I don’t even recognize until I am lashing out. I’ve always been very calm and controlled with my emotions. At least for the past 5-6 years or so. I was grey rocking before I even knew what that was. I just knew I couldn’t tell her anything or it would be used against me. I would get lectured. Yelled at. Belittled. Just straight up bullied. She would act like a teenage girl with some of the things she would do. Just the cattiness and the random insults. Ones that hit deep. It’s as if they know what will hurt you more than anything even if you don’t tell them. I hate it. I don’t understand any of this. Why I didn’t have parents who were parents. Just overgrown toddlers. Why did I have to emotionally regulate them. Why was it on me to fix things. Why did I have to get involved in their arguments. I don’t understand any of this. How can people be “responsible enough” to have kids and then have the audacity to treat you horribly. She has been sending me emails periodically. Sometimes they are just things to hurt me. Like pictures of my cat that I had to leave behind. Or even my dog with a swollen face because someone wasn’t watching her and she got into a wasp nest. We had button quails. Two of them have died since I left. Those birds were old so it makes sense, I just somehow feel responsible. I want nothing more than to respond to one of her emails. To tell her how she has made me feel. I’m then giving her ammunition. She will twist my words in whatever way possible so that I am to blame for everything. She can never take responsibility and if you call her out on anything, or even just have a sound argument she gets more upset. In her emails to me, she never once asked where I went. Why I left. If I’m ok. Or really anything like that. The only things I’ve gotten is “how are you”. That’s crazy. She doesn’t give a shit about anyone else. It’s so absurd. I’ve never liked her. Even at a young age. I knew something was up and that I didn’t want to be like that. I’m essentially the complete opposite of her. And I worked hard to get there. The only thing she really “apologized” for was that she “gave up on me”. She said that. That’s crazy for a mother to say to their child. That’s not someone you give up on as a parent. Even so, she blamed me for it. She said that I pushed her away and that she wasn’t wanted in my life and she could tell. Which like true, but if she didn’t treat me the way she did I wouldn’t have felt the need to push her away. What child doesn’t want a relationship with their parent? It was always something I wanted, but never really have. I have some amazing mother figures in my life now. And some amazing people. I just wish I could get to the bottom of my depression. I wish that I had to motivation or willpower to do something about it. I feel like I’m wasting away. Which is exactly what she would want. I don’t know. I’m just rambling now. I’m sure this makes little sense, so goodluck if you made it this far",Maximum-Blood251,1760229938.0,5,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o4bmdt/why_does_leaving_hurt_so_bad/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o4bmdt/why_does_leaving_hurt_so_bad/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o4bh1b,Fear mongering,"Did anyone else have an nparent who was constantly fear mongering? I do think that my nmom probably has undiagnosed anxiety but I think it was mostly fear mongering, especially as I got older. The other problem is that some of it was reasonable life advice, especially for a young girl, however, some of her warnings were absolutely bonkers.

Some examples:

* Don't drive with flip flops. If you get into an accident your foot could be severed. (Note: she frequently drives with WEDGED flip flops in the summer.)
* Don't drive with the windows open. Someone could pull a gun on you when you're stopped at a red light. (She often drives with the windows down.)
* Don't take a shower while home alone (I was about 20 years old) because someone could break into the house and attack you. (She proceeded to teach me this lesson by hiding behind a wall until I walked by after my shower while she held a hair brush like a knife)
* Don't date black men because black women will think you are ""stealing their men"" (This was a wildly racist statement to tell your 8th grade daughter)
* You can't only eat from the kids menu because boys won't want to date you or take  you to prom (I was definitely still a child when she told me this to try to convince me to stop being a picky eater)
* Don't have social media because creepy men will try to stalk/kidnap you (Ironically she started stalking/harassing me after I moved out and cut contact)
* Don't wear any clothing that identifies the school you go to because a creepy man at the store while we run errands could show up at your elementary school and try to kidnap you
* You can't go to your first high school dance because the senior boys might try to dance with you
* I can't park my car in the driveway because then she will have to park her car on the (wide, suburban) street and someone could sideswipe her car and then she won't be able to get to work and we won't be able to pay bills
* Don't wear short skirts, show cleavage, or wear shirts with graphics on my chest because that will encourage boys to sexually assault me
* Don't curse, you'll get a reputation as a potty mouth or a ""sailor's mouth""
* Don't dye your hair because you'll never be able to get a job (I was 17)
* Don't get dressed in front of your bedroom windows because the boy who lives next door will try to look at you (His bedroom windows were not across from mine. Also, I was a child and he was 5 years older than me.)",watermelon4487,1760229488.0,6,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o4bh1b/fear_mongering/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o4bh1b/fear_mongering/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False

1o4asmw,Do you feel comfortable talking about your narcissistic parents with people who hasn't experience N abuse?,"I never grew up throwing the term ""narcissist"" around. I never really knew what it entailed until my 30s and when I started therapy. I've dated many people in my 20s that I would consider ""toxic"" but never labelled them as narcissist. Fast forward to this year, I was in a relationship that was very mentally and emotionally abusive and it triggered a lot of childhood trauma for me. I went through this relationship with friends, and therapist trying to understand the red flags I overlooked and came to the conclusion of narcissism and narcissist abuse. After the relationship ended, I couldn't get over the similarities to my father. My father isn't a emotionally available guy. He has some deep seeded trauma that he doesn't talk about and he doesn't really talk to me about much but have always made sure I had money in my pocket when I see him. But I couldn't look pass some traumatic events regarding manipulation my dad pulled in my childhood and to my mom growing up. Fast forwarded to today, I finally opened up to my friend about it and he believe that I'm calling everyone a narcissist (which I'm not. Just my ex, my dad and characters on reality TV shows). I only feel seen when I talk to people who has experienced it. Even my therapist has little insight about N abuse but she never dismissed my claims. I asked my mom to talk to her therapist about it and she said that he feels like its thrown around a lot and we shouldn't be self diagnosing.

1o4ampp,Happy birthday mom,"Last friday I (44) asked my husband to call you, because your birthday is this sunday. I wanted to ask you to provide a 'safe space', where i could celebrate you without the chance of running into my brothers. 

You know why, they hurt me so much in the past. The last straw being them never contacting me ever since I am in palliative care. Every time I tried to express my pain to them, they exploded with rage. Calling me a manipulative bitch who always wants things her way. An arrogant know-it-all, always complaining. Most things completely coming out of left field. It felt like a bucket of s**t being poored all over me. When my first husband died, the same thing. No support, no love, and when asking why, the bucket came out. I never understood what I did wrong, and why I deserved this treatment. 

With you, I always had a complex relationship. You would always criticize me, but subtle. Never celebarated my accomplishments, but always finding something I could have done better. When I had a fight with somebody, you never supported me, but instead asked what I did to deserve that. My emotions were always so intense, according to you I feel a lot more than I should be feeling. I always make things bigger than they are. I never gave you any signs that I was struggling, ofcourse going to four/five therapists over the years doesn't count. That is just attention seeking behavior. 

When I was pregnant with my first son, I made the conscious decision to let him have grandparents. The relationship between me and my grandparents was always heavily influenced by your opinions of them. Therefore I ignored my own needs. And now I see that you can be a nice lady, at least to my sons. The last 8 years, we found a way to get along, or so I thought. I even started to trust you again.

But you told my husband that you simply cannot and will not choose between me and my brothers. You will not provide a safe moment for us to come. Even whilst knowing this is probably the last year I can attend.

My emotions ran high, and I wrote to you that you hurt me/us. That you in fact did choose. You chose to ignore my pain. You chose to rather not have me and your grandchildren, than ask my brothers to come at a different time.

Your reaction was deafening. Your silence hurt even more. 

I always wondered why my brothers were so against me. Then I read something about triangulation. That sure fits, you definitely like having control and being the centre of attention. These relationships are probably not salvagable anymore. So congratiolations, I guess. You won. 

Have a wonderful birthday.

1o48opv,"At what point are responsibilities ""too much""?","I (23f) have reached saturday and I'm just incredibly tired, I had a few hours home alone where I was thrilled to think that I would knock out some university work or even just write something for fun but alas, I just passed out on my bed for the entire duration of those hours.

This has been my week so far (Probably missed some things)

Some initial context, I have a 7 year old sister with autism and many other issues that she goes to multiple specialists for, my nMom stayed home this week due to calling sick from work just to be available to care for my grandma if something happened.

Monday: I arrive home from having taken an exam at university only to find nMom deep cleaning the house, emptying old toy chest form ym sister and throwing away stuff, something we hadn't done in months but I guess she just felt like it had to be RIGHT NOW. So I didn't get to sit down once I got home and had to help with the cleaning, sweeping and mopping the floor.   
  
I manage to get like two hours where I just pass out and then I get up, go pick up my sister from school, walk her back home and then watch her until midnight on top of bathing her, dressing her (She is incredibly babied too and I have to accompany her for every small task, even going to the bathroom) On top of all of that I had prepare dinner, take out trash, wash dishes, take care of animals and prepare nmom tea and coffee during the night.  


Tuesday: I thought this would be a calm day since it was nMom's payday but nope. Got woken up, sent to store to buy a lot of stuff beyond what I could carry so after a very slow trip back I made it home, once I arrive I learn that she ordered some vegetables and wanted me to clean the fridge for them while she prepared sister for school since she was gonna take her today. I think to myself ""okay sure no problem"" I clean the fridge, put the vegetables only to end up yelled at because sister was running late since I decided to do the fridge stuff instead of helping them prepare (It's not like my help would have made things any faster, it's normally nMom who takes the longest to get ready) so due to this I had to be the one to take sister to school.

Okay cool, I'm back home at 1 pm and I don't have to go pick up sister until 5 pm it should be chill! Except not... nMom spent the entire afternoon messaging me people to do bank transfers to since I don't know I guess it's easier to tell me to open her account and do transfers than her doing it herself. Then it's 5 pm, go pick up sister, watch until midnight, same chores as previous afternoon.

Wednesday: Got woken up getting yelled at because apparently nMom wanted to continue the cleaning from monday so I didn't get to even have breakfast before I found myself cleaning furniture, sweeping, mopping and much more again. By the time I was free I just found myself passing out and waking up in time to go pick up sister, watch her until midnight, bathe her, change clothes, all the usual stuff.

Thursday: Was supposed to have an exam here, I kinda just skipped it since I didn't get to study at all. Day was unremarkable other than being forced to help nMom with a tech support call and attending grandma's bday... And the usual 6 pm to midnight sister care on top of all the chores.

Friday: Today was a holiday day so sister was home all day, obviously my responsibility too. On top of that plumber showed up to fix something, had to be available if they needed anything on top of taking care of sister. Once plumber left had to mop again on top of cleaning the entire balcony so once again I found myself beyond tired, didn't really do much other than taking care of the chores, cleaning and taking care of sister.

Saturday (Today yay): Woke up early to take dog to vet, nmom was supposed to go but she deflected the responsibility to me so I went, took care of things and then went back home only to find out sister had already woken up so she was now my responsibility since nMom was taking her to cinema later.

So watch sister for hours, wake up nMom, help both of them get ready to go to cinema, losing like almost two hours to this task and then accompany them to the bus stop (Although nmom changed her mind like 100 meters in and told me I could go back home). I was thinking about how much I would get done in these hours and I just knocked out cold like an idiot, was unable to get back from bed other than for washing dishes and sweeping.

A few hours later nmom dms me to go pick them up at plaza (no I don't have a vehicle, this is literally me walking to where they are and then we walk back together again which feels so pointless), get home then go to store to buy some stuff we need. Now hilariously enough while I was writing this I got told to bathe sister so had to deal with that and also have to go make some coffee for nMom so will take care of that as soon as I post this.

Of course this week was exceptionally busy compared to my usual ones but it's not like my usual ones are much better, they would be something like:

Weekends: Watch sister from 10 am or 11 am to midnight, on top of taking care of all house chores while nMom rests because she's too tired from the week.

Weekdays: Take care of any uni classes in morning, babysitter takes care of sister unless it's tuesday in which case I have to get her ready and take her to school.   
Additional chores might show up for the time sister is at school (For example sweeping daily and mopping and cleaning balcony every 2 days approx)  
Go pick up sister at 5 pm  
Get home by like 6 pm  
Be responsible for sister until midnight  
Take out trash, wash dishes, bathe sister, get her dressed up, make her brush her teeth, feed her (Also make sure to help her learn to eat more foods since she has developmental issues in that front), clean anything the animals do, bring whatever nMom desires, close nMom's window and wardrobe door when she asks, etc etc.

Normally nMom works during the week though her schedule varies a lot so for simplicity's sake let's just say she works 7 am to 5 pm (Heavily skewing it in her favour with these numbers) and then she does MAYBE 1 or 2 hs of giving virtual classes for additional money once home, that's pretty much all she does.",FireyAmber,1760221667.0,3,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o48opv/at_what_point_are_responsibilities_too_much/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o48opv/at_what_point_are_responsibilities_too_much/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False

My parents asked me to send them $1,000 for rent. I love them, I really do, but I hesitated. I offered $500 instead, because I wanted to be smart and not just hand over everything the moment I got it. And they both got paid so they could’ve paid for rent. 

They stopped talking to me. My dad called saying I should’ve just sent the $1,000 and not said anything. My mom basically told me, “We don’t need your help, thanks.” I cried that night because all I did was try to have boundaries.

It hurt even more because I found out — through a family member…that my parents were literally laughing about me. About how I bought a watch, how I hesitated to pay for expensive glasses, how they “made me pay” for both dresses at the store and watched me struggle on purpose. They laughed about my Uber being $40 and said, “Now she knows how it feels when it’s her money.”

Hearing that broke me. I’ve always wanted to make them proud. I’ve always given when I didn’t even have much myself. I didn’t want to believe money could twist love like this, but it’s right there, in their words.

And the thing is, I didn’t even refuse completely. I still helped. I still gave. But apparently, saying no to one thing means I’m suddenly the villain in my own home.

Now I’ve opened a new savings account in secret, started building boundaries, and honestly — I just don’t feel safe sharing things with them anymore. I shouldn’t have to feel like I’m being spied on through Life360 or made fun of behind my back by my own parents.

I guess I’m just asking, how do I recover from this? Not just financially, but emotionally? How do I rebuild trust when I’ve realized the people who raised me might not actually respect me anymore?

1o47xu8,"If I'm being honest with myself, they're right to be disappointed.","My parents have done their best to assure me that they're not disappointed. But, it slips out in conversation frequently. It's best described as, ""Yeah, you could've done better. But, we're here for you."" followed by them not being there for me or chastising me if they need to be.

I ultimately chalk it up to ""tough love"" and making sure I can survive in the real world and recently thanked my father for being so tough on me to support my goals. He never responded and never acknowledged I sent him that text.

Regardless of where the line between fair and cruel is, I'm starting to realize they're not completely wrong to be disappointed in what I've become.

When I was young, I was considered minorly prodigious in my hometown, which itself wasn't lacking in bright minds. Unlikely I'd be anything major, but certainly a scholar of merit at a magnet University if I applied myself. I also contributed to a handful of papers on programming and mathematics. I was capable enough at my sport that if I had applied myself I had deals waiting for me. I also dabbled in electronics and politics enough to earn minor awards. It seemed like if I applied myself I could've picked practically anything and just run with it.

Today, I haven't played my sport in over a decade, haven't contributed to any papers in nearly half a decade, don't really apply myself to anything in cutting edge theory, and haven't applied myself in debate or electronics. All I'm good for is going to the gym, paying bills, designing systems for some mid-tier company, and being mentally unstable.

I just sit around trying to figure out how to make more money so I can get away from it all. I never got over a bad breakup, which plunged me into even more of a failure. I accidentally got myself into a laugh-cry fit the other night at how pathetic it is that I never amounted to anything. I put on one of my favorite movies to calm down, about a mathematician, which I hadn't watched in years and broke down again. I watched as he grinded on a difficult equation for weeks and was reminded of the joy and vigor with which I used to be involved at that level. I probably couldn't compete with a chimp these days.

It's hard not to sympathize with my parents thinking about it that way. It's like they had a racehorse, then watched as it just slept all day in its barn and got fat.

1o47mju,"Strange email from NMom, can anyone help?","Received a strange email from my NMom today and I can’t work out what she’s up to… can anyone help me understand whether she’s serious or just looking for attention?

Email essentially said that despite everything I am still her beneficiary and told me where she’d hidden a physical copy of her will. 

Some requests to give smaller amounts to my cousins kids if I felt I could and who to give everything to should I not want anything from her at all

I got the impression she was unwell a while ago - a cousin sent an urgent message which got deleted quickly. NMom has actually also toned down/slowed down her onslaught of guilt and shame for being NC so that tallies with her being unwell. She has however just turned 70 so could literally be getting things in order.

Idk if she’s terminally ill or not but it doesn’t change anything for me - I’m NC for good reason and never expected to be left anything. certainly not as a sole person either. 

I’m just curious what people think she’s doing? She’s married so nothing would go to me for some time anyway so even if she was terminally ill there’s actually no urgency to tell me?

Is she trying to drag me back in by vaguely hinting she is sick but if I speak to her and she’s not sick it’s “my misunderstanding”? 

Is she ill and trying to find a way to ask me to leave her estate to someone else? 

The point about where the physical will was hidden was very odd. Her husband is also highly abusive so I’m slightly worried that somethings escalating because why tell me and why hide it?

1o47dii,I think my step-dad is a narcissist and he keeps threatening to leave.,"I've only recently found this subreddit after trying to figure out what to do in my current situation, and reading through other people's reddit posts here has been a great comfort in helping me try to talk about this.

I \[M22\], think i'm dealing with a narcissistic step father \[M40's\]. I live with my mum \[F40's\] and my brother \[M12\]. We all live together and have for a few years now, and he's been with my mum maybe 6 years. I'm used to my mum and step-dad arguing a lot, and it's usually about money or someone gave a tone that they didn't like or they don't agree about parenting my younger brother. My step-dad is very loud and aggressive with how he speaks to my mother and both me and my sibling, and won't ever accept that he's wrong. He has to be right about everything.  
  
Recently he told off my brother very loudly for something he didn't even do (I left the water pump on, not my brother, and claimed to have seen my brother leaving the water on when it was me and I told him that). He then told me I had no idea what it was like to be a parent after I told him my brother did nothing wrong and he shouldn't be so loud with him, and I went off at him for it. For context, I had to help look after my little brother from a young age and help raise him so i'm very protective of him. We were in a heavy abusive situation and I had to see a lot of horrible things and were technically homeless after we left, and as the older sibling i've tried my best to look after my brother and shield him from what I can and teach him what's right and wrong, etc. It's why I kind of snapped about it because it felt like such a punch to the stomach when he KNOWS this.

Now he keeps screaming at my mum because apparently she's suppressing him by saying he's too abrupt with everyone and wants him to think about how he's treating people. He wants to ""toughen up"" my brother but he's really sensitive and in a house of people who were in a very abusive situation neither me or my mum think it's a good idea. He isn't my brother's dad biologically and thinks he has the right over my mum to decide how he should be parented.  
  
We're all very sensitive and all possibly on the autism spectrum, but because my step-dad has ""seen real autistic people"" he doesn't believe we are. He also refuses to believe in any of my diagnosis' because he's ""had a worse life"" and had a schizophrenic relative (despite myself being a victim of serious abuse with a diagnosis of BPD, PTSD and a serious dissociative disorder). I have to move my hands or pull my hair or hit my leg when I get stressed and have serious heart palpitations with it, and when I got overwhelmed like this before he just screamed at me to grow up.

He's now threatening to leave and abandon this family we've built for ourselves just because he doesn't want to accept he's wrong and that he IS hurting people. It's giving me serious traumatic flashbacks from our old abusive situation since my mum's ex was a similar way but was physically abusive as well. My step-dad now isn't physically abusive but he's verbally and emotionally aggressive, and has been ignoring me the past three days because I snitched on his shitty behavior towards my brother to my mum.  
  
I don't know what to do and I want to think about how to plan if he does leave. Me and my mum barely make enough as it is. Does anyone have a situation similar and how did you plan for the future to get out? Me and my best friend are currently saving for a flat together but with the cost of living it's hard, and I don't want to leave my mum and brother.",UnhappyPromise6930,1760218222.0,2,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o47dii/i_think_my_stepdad_is_a_narcissist_and_he_keeps/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o47dii/i_think_my_stepdad_is_a_narcissist_and_he_keeps/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o475cw,In need of house rules for health issues and problem with conversation with NMom,"TLDR have to either isolate and deal on my own so in need on advice on how to deal with under the circumstances or have a conversation with NMom so in need of advice on how to make that happen. 

I have titles if you want to read only specific parts.

# Some background. 
I am an adult. I have to leave with my mom. She has transferred the house to me with parental control meaning neither can throw the other one out. I have no job or money. And she helps with that so she have that kinda of control over me.
I have health and of course phycological issues so I can't really do a lot of things (I am struggling with basic needs). My mom has come far the last few months but things are still rough.

#The problem 
I need advice on. Winter is coming and is going to be rough due to my health issues. I need to ensure that I will be warm. I have two options to have an understanding with my mom or to be locked up in a space I have created and manage on my own. 

# What I have tried/turned into a vent
I was trying to have a discussion about it with her cause the best option is of course to make a plan together but she always avoids to have any kind of serious discussion with me unless she starts it. After an exhausting attempt, I just set a boundary on either she sets a date in the following days to discuss or I am locking my self up and manage on my own (which she hates cause it means she have no control. Can't access the water heater cause it's in my room and I will have the dog inside the house while she feels like the dog has fleas. So she wants it outside). To be clear none of that I will do to spite her I will do only what I think is best for me and the dog, I just know that will annoy her, which she can resolve by talking with me and making a plan that works for everybody.

# The problem (the continue)
If she doesn't want to discuss with me I really need to make a plan. I have a bedroom, a mini kitchen/workspace and a bathroom on my own that are connected with a hallway that has a door in the middle, this is what I will lock. We don't have money and certainly I don't, so we don't have heat, and if we can't discuss I won't be able to open the heat even if we have. My room has a vent that is broken and Is literally like I have an open window 24/7. If I use the windows to warm the place, my autoimmune reacts with the sun so I must be somewhere else (she asked me about it and I said I will stay in the shower. Not entirely bad plan if I find a way to sit and not brake my back). I have no sense of smell and till now I always had someone to tell me when there was something burning so maybe I need a plan on how to cook without burning the house down (I have almost done that twice with the mini kitchen I have,  In the main kitchen there is far less risk of that due to the fact that is more secure as an appliance and is in a good place with minimum risk even if I leave the stove on). I can go to the rest of the house in the mornings when she will be gone at work (assuming I don't get a job as well and be out). She has the tendency to leave the window open all day cause she says that the house smells otherwise, so even if I am able to get out I am not sure I will be able to stay cause  I am extremely cold and have a risk of developing frostbites easily (that's why I need to make sure I am warm). I can take 1-3 woolen blankets (I am not sure how many she will allow me to take. I first heard about them during the summer when she tried to give them for the homeless Which Is good, but honestly why did she left me so many years to freeze and use 4 semi warm blankets. So I also have another good blanket but not good enough, 2 fliss blankets and 2 summer blankets. I also may be able to take some rugs for the floor. Don't have thick curtains and I may be having a broken window frame, I think I fixed it but I won't know till I am freezing. I have done the best I can on having warm clothes. Any other ideas? Also having asthma and arthritic symptoms so if I am not prepared I may be paralyzed by the flares (this is what happens nost of the time, I can't do it again) I can barely breathe without an asthma attack and struggle feeding myself most of the time. I need to get a job at some time, so I need to be able to move.

# Alternative 
If we have an understanding with my mom. We can keep the whole house in a good temerature. There are plenty of warmer rooms in the rest of the house. We are lucky that we have one of those old houses, grampa built it when it was cheap to built a house. I could use the heater when needed and when we are able instead of preying that she will open it for a little in the night. I could cook safer and much much easier. 
So If you have any advice on how to make her sit and talk with me. And how to act so we can actually find a solution. It would be greatly appreciated.
I don't really believe that cause I even if we do I don't believe it will last but I am already freezing and it's barely cold outside so I need this to work. Spoiler alert: my therapist don't think we can talk.

# For whoever wants to try and help me find ways to talk with her.

Problems I have detected. I she may have some unresolved issues maybe PTSD and almost certainly has ADHD (nothing diagnosed, in her mind she is perfectly fine). When I try to talk she shuts down. She literally can't hear me when I talk. She says she gets tired after talking and stops the conversation. She never comes back to a conversation. She changes the subject every few words. She acts like an idiot husband where they don't have any reason to talk until the wife gives up and moves for divorce then they are all about fixing the problems. If she is uncomfortable starts laughing, which after the frustration I can't handle ( I know it's a nervous system response to stress, I try to remind my self), she also laughs to fit out of a situation, she uses it as a tactic. 

I get overwhelmed and triggered cause I have 20 years that I am dealing with this. I yell a lot and sometimes like today I loose my shit. 
I know humor works to help her refocus ( for the husband act I straight up told her she was acting like that and if I wanted to deal with it I would get married but I am not and have no intantion of doing it so please act like an intelligent human being I know she is) but as mentioned with the frustration I have built in this conversation (at every conversation) I have no patience for humor. Also compliments help. 

For example today we started discussing about the house, she told me tomorrow she will have company all day in the house, I responded about the fact that she told me after 4 times I had asked if we could talk tomorrow and would appreciate a little warning,like not trying to actively keep it a secret when I ask her. She asked what problem I had today that she did that I answered she stopped me irritated asking me why I am torturing her and to please just tell her what my problem was. I answered that I just told her what my problem was and asked her what she heard she answered, yapping. I told her to concentrate cause I was gonna tell her exactly what annoyed me, started explaining she stopped me asking why I was torturing her and if I could just please tell her what was my problem today. Again the same dance for a second time, then third, I was getting increasingly more frustrated and then at the forth time I realized I was pulled into discussing something completely different from what we started and told her I was loosing it so I couldn't continue and she could either give me a date to discuss about the winter that is coming or I would manage as I see fit and she won't have an opinion on the matter explaining the likely consequences she would experience. And then left to go make my bed for sleep. She then suddenly had a interest in talking about the subject. I shut her  down and just continued making my bed till she stopped talking. Then I started writing. 

To whoever read all that. Thank you! And congratulations on the patience and perseverance!!!",Nirhida,1760217635.0,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o475cw/in_need_of_house_rules_for_health_issues_and/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o475cw/in_need_of_house_rules_for_health_issues_and/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False

1o44e52,Flying monkeys odd behavior after death of Narc,"Ok. So, I'm hoping someone can relate to this, as I have been healing SO many narc wounds after my parent's deaths and 0 people in my life to validate my feelings/ experiences.. if you know you know. My parents were very financially successful while they were alive, however I ran one of their businesses for 15+ years.. motivated by deep feelings of guilt and dependency on them... The reality was I gave up on my own hopes and dreams, to build up there's, while they took full credit and refused to acknowledge any of my hard work, success or sacrifices. All my mistakes were amplified, or just simply made up, then smeared around to all their employees, extended family, any mutual people we had AND especially my own child. It would always amplify if they found out someone had complimented me or  recognized me as a good person. That person would loathe me a few days or weeks later anyway, no matter what I did.. confused me to no end when I was younger, but later realized it was due to my parents smear campaigns (secretly ran behind my back.. while they loved bombed me in secret as well) they were experts at this, and I eventually gave up even caring what others thought, trying to prove myself etc.. just became numb really and gray rocking was my only go to protection. It got really bad the older I got and the more successful their business got.. I was paid minimum wage, and often punished when they just ""forgot"" to pay me. I had many side jobs just to feed my child.. until my parents would find out and sabotage it any way they could.. the more secretive I kept my successes, the more I was monitored, computers hacked/ recorded, cameras and listening devices found more often... It got so bad I honestly started to believe death was my only escape from them. I prayed for 3 days straight for God to save me from the abuse, especially for my daughter, I refused to let her suffer my upbringing, that's honestly what kept me fighting so hard. Well, my narc father dropped dead after that and even though I was sad and grieving , the slow realization that I could actually live normally now, without constant control, monitoring, mind games etc.. had hit and actually led to a couple psychotic breaks.. lots of therapy and healing these past 2 years. The business I ran for 15+ years and got minimum wage for (while both narcs lived lavishly) sold for 10 million soon after and literally gave me another chance at life completely. However, every single flying monkey/ abuser accomplice in my life became extremely triggered and worked to sabotage this in some way. I caught on quickly to plans and plots though because they didn't have as much access to me or my life like before... now that they narc leader was gone they literally held no power over me. I was even told about a hit put out on my life by previous coworkers who couldn't buy me anymore. I couldn't believe how far some tried to go.. but, eventually they all stopped trying and now just usually stalk me online, drive by my house, gossip to others I don't even know... Things I was already used to, actually not as severe as my narc parents could do. Many of them (especially extended family) woke up to how strong I actually was the entire time and kind of seemed scared of me or just avoided me entirely. I have had to seriously isolate myself though, to correctly discern people's intentions, but it's SO much easier now that the narcs are gone. Realized there were so many narc abusers surrounding me, and  kind of surprised I made it through all that, but then again not really, as those narcs were ""babys"" to me compared to the high level, high functioning narcs that birthed me. The strength you get from healing and protecting yourself from parents who literally competed with you and tried to sabatoge all happiness (or take for themselves) is a rare superpower apparently, who knew lol. Anyway, my question is Has anyone else experienced the flying monkey's wild behavior after the narcs death? What was/ is your experience? Did most of them give up and avoid you, or just find new ways to abuse you? Also, the millions I inherited is definitely going towards helping other victims of narc abuse, especially children, escape the abuse and break the cycles. How's that for irony?

1o43ued,"realized my mother is potentially a narcissist, tips for identifying?","so, for background info, i was raised by a single mother, and given the impression that my father just walked out. while he’s tried multiple times to be in my life, it just didn’t work out. i (19F) was on summer break this year, living at home, and it was constantly tumultuous. arguing every other day, being accused of who knows what. i also came to the realization that we are enmeshed and that im a victim of emotional incest. i decided that i couldn’t rely solely on my mother, and wanted to form a relationship with my father. after talking a few times, i realized that information he was telling me was disproving several things my mom had told me for years (that i knew/suspected were false). examples of this are: her being infertile, being a straight a student, multiple major events during their relationship, as well as him describing negative behaviors of hers down to a T. 

after realizing she is very prone to lying about things relating to how she’s perceived by others, i started thinking about the possibility of her being a narcissist. her mother, my grandmother, shows a very large portion of NPD symptoms, and my mother was abused by my grandmother growing up (i know this to be true).

i was just wondering if you guys could give me any examples of what to look for to know for certain. im only showing hesitancy bc it is (in my option) a rather extreme thing to think someone has, as well as the fact that at times she can treat me vaguely/relatively nice. 

TLDR: how can i know if my mother is a narcissist, especially if she can be kind at times/somewhat caring? i know enmeshment can alter the relationship, which is why i’m struggling to see if NPD would be the true answer here.

1o43l74,Our mother really did many things to make us happy - And now she loves to remind me and expects us to do the same,"The backstory of this is a big can of worms, so I'm already trying to keep it as short as I can. I'm really upset right now will probably ramble a lot.

About my living sitiuation: I live with my mom. We always lived together. I am the youngest of four children and the only daughter. I don't need to pay rent, but do pay for the household. My mother and I get along most of the times. We would chat, we would watch TV together, just have genuinely have a good time in each other's company. My mother was in an arranged marriage.

The backstory:

I have three brothers, the eldest was terrible to the rest of the family and I never really got over it. He still has issues nowadays, but also two daughters. He does genuinely love them, but apart from that he's still the very same human being that I want out of my life.

My mother knows that. She has witnessed many times how awful he can be. She has thrown him out of the house and let him back in many times.

About a year ago my mother told me about an arrangement: My brother and his family will come over every week and spend 3-4 days here. Because of work-related issues. (They live in a separate city, the gf still works here)

From the start I told her that I hated this idea. I reminded her so many times about what happened and how genuinely scared I am of him.

My mother was on my side, tell me that she doubts they will go through with the arrangement after all. That she would keep an eye on my brother and won't give him another chance if he messes up again.

I brought this topic up many times because I never heard anything new. The arrangement was standing as it was. I always told her how ANXIOUS it made me whenever I thought about it.

Usually my mother would keep telling me not to worry and that she won't allow him to do anything.

But sometimes she would get irritated. One time she said ""You shouldn't obsess so much over what happened in the past""

The other one hurt even more: ""I always thought that you were just exaggerating because, well... you know how you can be"" (I know that I'm a sensitive person, but apparently she sees me in a whole new level of insecure and dramatic) That was the first instance which made me realize that my mother never took my feelings seriously.

Eventually my brother and his family came and I hated every second of it. I don't like children. My nieces are cute, but I don't like even them. The smell that comes with toddlers and fills the rooms makes me nauseous, leftover food is lying everywhere, the sound when they talk and shout is so irritating to me and I can feel every step they take. I always have their eyes on me when I leave the room.

I told my mother how much I hated it. Her answer: ""What am I supposed to do?? I don't want to choose between my two children.""

She took my side in all of this less and less.

Now to what happened yesterday:

My brother and nieces were about to come again today in the morning. Last time that happened I was in my bed and could hear my mom and brother trying their best to keep the little ones quiet. It didn't really work, but I was genuinely surprised that they tried for my sake at all. I said that to my mother yesterday. And that I would be very thankful if they tried it again.

The look she gave me. Then she said those words again: ""What do you want me to do? I can't control them! You've got nerves to ask me that!"" and when she left the room, she said one last sentence:

""*You got any other wishes*?""

This is a sentence she often said when I was complaining about little things, sometimes just jokingly. Always the same tone. That sarcastic, degratory tone.

She considers my big issues just as the same as the small complains.

Apart from our fights there also times where it seemed like she genuinely listened to me. Where I saw that there was a glimpse of hope for her to understand me.

But with that one sentence the hope now has been shattered for good.

I didn't say anything. I was tired of saying anything. We both told each other good night with a cold voice and went to sleep.

Next morning I was, of course, awakened by the nieces. My mother and brother were with them and they all sounded so happy. I still felt miserable. I got up, said good morning quickly and then started sorting some stuff in my room with the door closed. Right now I'm working on moving out. So why not start packing some things already? While doing this I was thinking only one thing: ""Please don't come in here to talk to me""

She sometimes came in my room to ask mundane things. It was obvious that she was upset, but didn't want to say anything. Eventually I made the mistake and asked her ""Is something wrong?""

And then she started. She said that she's so troubled to stand between two of her children, how can I just not understand how beautiful it is to spend time with children, I would never understand because I have no children myself (She knows I'm child free. I think she's not a fan of that).

She then said I couldn't understand how hard it is to be a mother. She did raise the four of us on her own for the majority of our lives - She and my father divorced 20 years ago when i was a toddler.

She told me how hard it was to handle finances. How noone will ever know how much she worked to give us a good life. How she has always lived as a mother only. How much she sacrificed for us.

But what about us? Does one of us ever think about returning that kindness? She ""understands"" that we work and earn money while she refuses to do any work in her age because of physical issues (she does have them). But she feels like she has been taken granted for her entire life. By us. When was the last time we gave her a larger sum of money? When was the last time where we treated her with a vacation? Why don't we think the same way she does? When my (other, cooler) brother lived here he paid more to the household than I do (I'll ask him if that's actually true)

I made the second mistake. I asked her ""Do you want me to give you money right now?""

She didn't say ""Yes"" Because that would of course make her look greedy. She didn't give a clear answer. But she kept on rambling. All I could hear was ""I want you to pay me back for all I have done!""

Now, when i offered to give her money, I didn't offer it out of kindness or remorse. I hoped that she would take the money and leave me alone. Since what she said yesterday I don't want her around me anymore. I didn't think she could disappoint me more than she already did, then this happened.

The thing is, she does have a point. She did show us genuine love, she financed things that made us happy, she listened and hugged us when we cried. We had no idea she was struggling financally until like 3 years ago, when she dropped that bomb when she had the exact same kind of rant.

But does this give her the right to now demand this from us? To treat me this way? Part of me still thinks that I'm acting entitled. That's just a few days a week and they leave me alone in my room. That maybe I really was ungrateful and undermining all she has done for us.

On the other hand.. I'm just tired. I'm tired of talking to her at all. If I gave her all my savings right now and make her disappear for a few months, I would have done it then and there.

This woman raised me, showered me with love, did so many things for me and I want her out of my life.. I'm tired of talking to her. I'm tired of her wanting to talk to me. I want out. But I don't have any success looking for a new flat.

I do have other brothers. I do have friends. I do have a father. All of them are so amazing and without them I would have gone insane. But they're not living here with my mother. And I can't live with them (logistically impossible). They don't make the same experiences I'm having.

My friend told me to post here and seek support. I don't know if anyone reads this wall of text, but... Is it wrong from me to not want to pay mother back the way she wants us to?

1o43bvk,How do I let go of my mother?,"My (f24) mom is awful,. She hasn't ever physically abused me, but the emotional abuse was daily. 

I left home 4 years ago and I am happily married with a baby on the way now. I want to let go of her and never talk to her again, but I don't want to be the reason she is hurting. I don't want me, my husband or our baby to be affected by the stress she causes, but I can't seem to cut her loose.

I don't want to take away her becoming a grandma, but she is not deserving of it. 

She has done good things for me, but the bad outweighs that so so much. I want to be a good daughter, but I don't have a good parent to be that for.

I feel like the only way this misery would end and I would feel peaceful is if she died..

But I don't want to live like this, waiting to feel peace until she dies... so how do I let go?

1o42zc1,Distrustful of nice people being a victim of covert narcissism,"I always thought my mom was genuinely nice, doing everything, caretaking, always having a soft tone to everything in public no matter the circumstance or situation (that to me now in retrospect seems in authentic.) But every so often behind close doors she was subtly throw out passive aggressive jabs of criticism that didn't seem overtly abusive, but nonetheless it affected my self esteem. I didn't see through it like I do now after so long living with her for so long. My nervous system just felt off around her even though she presented this goody two shoes persona. She wouldn't get mad at people in public - lets say if her friend was angry at her, she would suck it up and be the better person I guess? She would always help her friends (even if behind their backs she would tell me she did not want to and criticize them for being inconsiderate)

But with all that being said my whole life I thought she was genuinely nice, but I always had low self esteem. If I had been raised in a healthy household, that low esteem had to come somewhere and probably it was intergenerational trauma. But now I am left to pick up the pieces and am distrusting of people (especially those that are outwardly too nice because they are the ones that most deceptive vs those who are reactively angry because of injustice.) With all this, how does one tell the difference from people who are genuinely nice vs. those who are nice only because they have that persona and a genuinely a horrible person behind closed doors? Covert narcissism I believe is more insidious than grandiose version because people can outwardly tell they are obnoxious and subsequently filter them out but I believe its harder with coverts.",generate913,1760207351.0,10,1.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o42zc1/distrustful_of_nice_people_being_a_victim_of/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o42zc1/distrustful_of_nice_people_being_a_victim_of/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False

1o42ad4,It's about how you can serve them,"I basically left but am LC/VLC. She doesn't know this and doesn't need to since I'll eventually have to come back to live under the same roof as her (temporarily until I can get away again. rinse and repeat.)

Anyway, it's amusing how she messaged how she wants me back ""soon"". Sure, she needs someone to do the chores, to be a punching bag, pay for things and so on and so on.

It's amusing how I told her I don't know how much I can help (translation: I don't intend to because I've been doing that all this time without any form of appreciation or kindness from her) and how where I'm at, things basically cost more for me. (A given since I'm not under the same roof as her right now.)

She didn't say anything towards that and I knew this already but it just validated how an N will always only give a F about themselves and what you can do and provide for them. They don't care how you're doing and don't care if you have to bend over backwards for them as long as it serves them. It's all about their needs and how they can benefit from you.

Confession: If she wasn't an N, I wouldn't have to go out of my way to get away. It sucks that we have to go through such lengths just to get away from toxicity. What irks me is how even when we get away, we still may battle toxicity and challenges, and maybe, if that person wasn't an N, we could have just chilled, taken it easy and grow where we're meant to be comfortable in the first place.",rockstarbae,1760205656.0,8,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o42ad4/its_about_how_you_can_serve_them/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o42ad4/its_about_how_you_can_serve_them/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o4294u,Life’s about to change and I’m scared.,"When I was 18 I moved out immediately after highschool, halfway across the country. Being around my family was hard. My dad with his anger and my mom with her depression.

She has always secluded herself from people and when she does try to connect she is just so generally miserable it’s tough for her to hang on to people when she’s always looking at the negative. 

After I moved out my mom divorced my dad thinking it would change her life. She found a beautiful place to live. And I thought she’d be happy. But she was still miserable.

She then decided she needed a new husband so she very quickly met one and sold her place. They moved south after hating the cold north and thought she’d be happy in a warmer climate. Then for years she has hated it down there. Her husband was… unkind aswell. And she has been miserable. 

Well. Her husband passed this week and she wants out of where she is. Unfortunately she has no one except for me. My sister won’t even talk to her after how we grew up. So she’s planning to move to within an hour of me. 

I love her dearly but there is a reason I moved halfway across the country when I did. I’m so very nervous about her coming out here. I already know everything she will hate. It’s cold, it’s crowded, there’s a ton of traffic and it’s way more expensive here. 

Meanwhile she has no plans for the future. She wants me to take care of her. I intentionally chose not to have children so that no one would have to be burdened with taking care of me as I age. She has no savings for a ‘nursing home’ when it’s time, just plans to buy a mobile home. 

I truly don’t know what to do. I love my mom, but she told me for years how I am the only thing she has and I’m the only thing that makes her happy. I can’t be that person. She is so constantly depressed and anxious. I’ve had to parent her since I was a child to have therapy and take meds and she doesn’t follow through. 
When I have conversations with her they often end up with her in tears about something. I consider myself a bit autistic (not diagnosed) and I do NOT do well with other people’s emotions and I’m getting so nervous thinking about her being this close.

She’s already expecting me to fly there and drive with her across country back because of her dog that’s as anxious as she is. I work for my husband but she doesn’t seem to realize that it is still a job. 

I know it’s horrible to say and to even think. But I really don’t know what to do. I have a full life, my husband and I just empty nested from his son and we have been enjoying having our space. I feel like everything is going to change.

I’m just so stressed.

1o40bb6,How do you handle your mom copying you?,"I'm not really sure what her deal is. But I notice she copies me here and there. 

If I make a fish recipe she tries and really likes, she'll make the same thing the next day, but with chicken. And then gets upset when I say I'm not a big fan of it/I don't feel up to eating the same thing again. (And I'm not saying I'm not a big fan just to be negative. She just happened to put a lot of heavy cream and it was too heavy for me specifically. Other than that, it was perfectly fine.)

If I start trying to have my own routine, at some point during it she starts inserting herself in some way. I go out on a walk. I'm usually gone for the same amount of time. She starts showering right when I'd get home and take a shower after my walk. 

If I try a new recipe and it's spicy, she won't eat it, but she'll 1. Cook something else with spices and claim she... ""doesn't want spice"" and that's why she didn't try my food 2. Once I'm done with all the leftovers of what I made, she'll make... you guessed it, something equally as spiced as what I had originally made. And again, gets upset when I don't want to try it because she adds in things I am just not a fan of. 

If I have a day off, I let her know I'd be happy to do something with her. She never brings it up. To the point of not speaking to me all day even though we're around each other.  Until the next day when I'm busy. And I have to let her know ""I can't. I let you know I had time yesterday, but now I'm busy."" And it turns into ""sorry I didn't ask you yesterday"" with a lot of silent treatment after. 

I put a lot of effort into make an intricate lasagna (everything from scratch), and she loved it. She then... makes lasagna. And again, gets upset that I'm not a big fan of the recipe she followed. So then she keeps making it for other people, which is obviously fine, but she keeps emphasizing how everyone else loved it. And I'm just like... ""That's actually really great and it sounds like they appreciated the meal. That was nice of you"". But it's still such a sensitive topic. 

I mean... even making rice. She's been doing it for so long. But never taught me. I decided to teach myself and follow a recipe. It came out great. She tries it. ""Wow, this is better than mine"". Okay... it's not a competition. I offer to send her the recipe and let her know all I did was not add as much water. She's not interested. She keeps making rice her way. Not a problem. But if I eat the rice she makes, it's: ""I'm glad you're eating MY rice"". Okay... 

She also made what I found to be an off-putting comment the other day about how she wishes she could make a wig out of my hair and wear it.... She has hair. She has nice, long hair. She just... doesn't take care of it. I've offered to do her hair for her, but she never takes me up on the offer. Everything for hair is left in the bathroom too, so it's not like she doesn't have access to the same products. 

Again, I'm not really sure what her deal is, but this felt like a good place to post. I'm just feeling really annoyed and honestly sad. I feel sad that so many little things feel like competition or feel like someone is cheering for me but also trying to derail me at the same time.

1o3zep9,I don't want my mum around my unborn child,"This is a mix of a rant/ support request/ looking for advice.


I (23f) have always struggled with feeling like I overreact to my mums behaviour, partly because any time I've called her out on it she's basically said as much. We've had a backwards relationship (me being the parent) ever since I developed empathy, which has always been difficult but in the past 7/8 years I've tried distancing myself from it more.

For much of my life, she's balanced on the line of 'not the worst parent, definetly not okay though'. I definetly have some good memories of her from when I was litte where she tried to be a decent parent but I also have many more of objectively awful things she did and how she treated me/ neglected to consider what consequences her behaviour had on me. I will give her that she had a pretty traumatic childhood and was in care due to all kinds of abuse throughout her teen years, but she also refuses to deal with her trauma or her obvious mental health issues always claiming she has it under control.

Since I moved out at 15 she has slowly gotten worse and more volatile, coming to a head late last year, shortly before my brother (18) moved out and came to live with me. Whilst she's not someone I choose to spend time with unless I have to, my biggest issue is that she does drugs.

She's always done drugs (since before she had me) but for the most part it's 'just' been weed. For the past 10ish years however she's gotten into different and harder stuff to the point where she is never sober (she now has a heavy coke habit on top of the weed, and I also suspect that shes smoking crack again but not as often). This has obviously had a massive effect on both myself and my brother but we made it through and are both out of it now, thankfully.

I haven't been close to my mum in years now and have kept her to a minimum without upsetting her and causing an argument (she really kicked off last time I tried to go NC and I unfortunately backed down as a result) so she's still in my life but I don't see her more than 2/3 times a year as I now live in a different city and we only call every few weeks/ months.

I got married earlier this year and she was invited, she even came to my hen do (where she made it all about herself and honestly kind of ruined the experience). But since then, I've found out a bit more of whats been going on. My brother told me what he knew just before he moved in with me, but from what I've found out she's just spiralling further out of control and it looks like she's going to lose her house and job very soon.

I feel bad about cutting her out of my life completely but since finding out that I'm pregnant, I can't stand the idea of her being anywhere near my child. I didn't even tell her I was pregnant until I was 12 weeks (I'm 4 months along now) because I wasn't sure I even wanted to, but I eventually thought that it'd be best to tell her before it blew up.
 
Although she's not someone I'd ever let have my child unsupervised, finding out the true extent of her issues has made me not even want her to meet my child, especially with how she is now.

Ultimately I know I have to tell my mum, and as much as I want to give her the chance to sort herself out so that she could meet my child, I don't think I trust her to not just lie about her drug use (she's tried lying to me before but you can clearly see when she's off her face, as she doesn't hide it as well as she thinks she does).

She's been so excited since she found out that I'm pregnant and has been all up in my buisness more that she has been in years - constantly going on about how she's so excited to be a grandma and how she's going to do so much stuff with my kid, telling me what I'm having based on how I look/ feel - all of which isn't making it any easier to tell her.

I'm so stuck on how I should approach this and as much as I wish I could just slowly distance myself I know I need to tell her. She also wants to come and visit next month which is a big no-no as I have my anomaly/ anatomy scan and I don't want her know anything more about this baby (other than it exists obviously).

It’s constant. The last week, it was 1–2am and he had me help measure the living room because he wanted to start a DIY project.

And then when he’s home all day, things will go untouched like the trash or dishes being put away after the dishwasher ends, then has the galls to make comments saying “Hey, don’t let these dishes pile up” when there’s only 1 bowl in the damn sink!  Oh and it’s never really requests, it all starts with “Can you do me favor?” or “Hey, I need some help”. If I push back, he guilt trips me with, “Come on, don’t be like that. Family helps family.”

It’s draining. I don’t feel like I’m allowed to have boundaries. He talks like I’m obligated to handle things because I’m his son. Meanwhile, I’m juggling school, an internship, and planning my future after graduation. Every time I try to spend time with my girlfriend or focus on myself, he makes comments about scarcity, distance, or how I should be spending more time at home.  But every damn time I go “home” or see/talk to him it turns into a request/demand, I can’t even talk to my own ndad without it turning into bullsh**.  And no one in his family holds him accountable, they always turn it into “your [n]dad has been taking care of you your whole life” trying to justify his bullsh**.  I don’t even talk to my family about it because they never help.

I can’t wait to move out after graduation, even if it means being “house poor” at first. I’d rather have an empty apartment than keep feeling like this. Has anyone else dealt with a parent who treats you like a built-in assistant instead of their child? How did you set boundaries or cope until you were able to leave?",[deleted],1760195552.0,8,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o3y3qf/feel_more_like_an_assistant_than_son/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o3y3qf/feel_more_like_an_assistant_than_son/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o3y3ff,Everything bothers my nmom.  EVERYTHING.,"My daughter slept in my bed last night.  She woke up happy.  She wanted to giggle.  We snuggled, said good morning, taking in the joy, she wanted tickles.

I obliged.

My mother who called CPS on me was bothered.  She stomped to her bedroom door, shut it, and after my literally demented dad got up without her help when she neglected to check on him when she woke up was walking without assistance and asked her how she slept (he can't hear a fucking thing without hearing aids) and was honestly asking her?  ""I slept fine until I had to listen to THAT.""  She doesn't ask him how he slept.

LMAO

Her grandchild who is not neglected, is fed before I'm fed (autism, food preferences) me, has toys, new clothes, new underwear, morning tickles and giggles to wake up, a mother who knows her worth, a regular doctor, specialist referalls on the other side of the state and a trip to the ocean as a treat afterward...

That grandhild laughing in the morning is a problem.

She's mad if they cry.  She's mad if they laugh in the morning.  She's mad if they are mad.  S

She is officially going off the deep end.  My family has been with her for the 5 years I was gone.  They were the boiled frogs.  I see the stark change.

She's still a bitch.

Also she is delaying cataract surgery.  She's going blind.  She's gonna blame that on us.  lol

1. I pay rent.
2. I have never not paid rent at any place I've lived.
3. I don't ask for them to help me take care of my kids.
4. We buy our own food
5. We don't talk to them
6. We find ways to be happy despite her constant bitching.
7. I suggest she get out of the house and make friends
8. I listen to her rage at suggestions and laugh.

She is losing the battle to get me to be mad.

I tell her ""You could benefit greatly from mental healthcare.""

I know that will backfire.  That's why we're leaving for the day.

Fuck this shit.

I was accused of neglect and her husband who hallucinates, can't hear without hearing aids, has trouble standing, not falling, knowing what time it is, and shits himself if he can't get to the bathroom fast enough is not receiving care she said he would get when he left the hospital.

Projection for miles.

She won't let him keep his denture cream next to him because that ""doesn't belong here.""  She puts it in the bathroom on the other side of the house.  SHe told him someone coudl go get it for him.  He said there are exceptions, actually standing up to her for once, and she snarled at him.

I HATE THIS BITCH SO MUCH.

  
EDIT:  My kids are playing together on a couch.  Laughing.  Giggling.  I love that they are happy together and not squabbling.  I will not ruin their joy to make her comfy, because fuck her.  The 'noise' bothers her.  lol. Get earplugs, bitch.

1o3y07p,Active grief and the cycle of toxic family dynamics,"Hello Fellow survivors of familial narcissistic abuse. My path has been a long one. Both of my parents are narcissists, but my mother is the most toxic of the two (likely because she’s been involved with my life a lot more than my father). My folks split 18 years ago (thank god) and while my dad immediately got married without telling us until after (to someone we didn’t know, a whole different story), my mom unraveled mentally and physically. She got diagnosed with Crohn’s disease and became addicted to opiates. She would drink, smoke, and live on coffee and popcorn and then complain about her health problems, and constantly said “it doesn’t matter what I eat” whenever me my siblings would question her habits. It became “her disease”. Her existence was based around how she was victimized by her diagnosis and how much my dad harmed her.

The triangulation between me and my siblings began in our childhoods. I was the “scapegoat”, and remain as such in our dynamic. She would physically and verbally abuse me in front of my siblings, who would be terrified and baffled as the punishment rarely suited the “crime”. After I would be in trouble, she would take my siblings out for treats and shopping without me. This behavior carried well into our adulthood. She holds holiday get togethers with my siblings and does not tell me about it until afterwards.

Let me rewind a bit- when I was in my 20’s and had my first of two children, her behavior was at its peak- she made my daughter’s birth all about her and how hard it was that she was “going through it without her husband”. She would get wasted, smoke cigarettes and then get upset when I asked her to wash her hands before touching the baby. Of course, we grew up in a house where she smoked inside. She demonized my baby’s father and would be completely rude to him, asking him to go get things from the store (she was in town to “support us as new parents”), then would scream “fucking MEN!” About anything benign- I laughed at it at the time, but eventually her presence became too stressful and I asked her to leave. Then the silence… I didn’t hear from her until my daughter was nearly a year old.

My mother’s sister whom I was very close with lived close to us… she would often help out with my daughter and was a positive and supportive person in our life. My mother was infuriated by this, and came into town and screamed at her sister for trying to “replace her”. She would sneer at photos of us together or photos of my child around my aunts apartment. Obviously, my aunt was appalled at this. But my mom has power- not long after this, my aunt moved back to Canada, and my mother moved to our city. It broke my heart.

And then, the triangulation of myself and my siblings began to really pick up- mentioning little things here and there, complaints or judgements about them to me (and of course it was the other way around with them). When we would be all together, my mother would constantly be paranoid that we were “laughing at her”. She would sneak up on us if we were talking in another room. It was weird, but we were all used to this nonsense. My Mother was jealous of our relationships, and made it her business to try and pry us apart. Sadly, it worked. My siblings and I, who were extremely close for most of our lives, no longer speak to me or each other. No conversations, no ultimatums, just silence. When I was pregnant with my second child, I saw my sister out in public at a show, and she walked right by me, pretending not to see me (I know she did). That happened again with my youngest sibling as well- I was with friends, thankfully, and they were in awe and supported me because that STINGS.

Setting boundaries with my mother has always, always lead to the same “punishment”: no contact. I’m talking months or years. The last time I spoke to her was nearly 5 months ago, when I put up a boundary about a toxic behavior- my youngest child is 2… that’s a lot of her life where “grandma” ain’t there. She lives 5 minutes away. I asked her to have a conversation so we could move forward, no response. Then yesterday, out of nowhere, she asks me for my address so she can “mail” my oldest a birthday gift. I was triggered. I said “we live 5 minutes away away, don’t waste $ on the mail” and then “I need to know if you want a relationship with me or my children/ I’d be happy to do so but I need it to be with a therapist”. I’m not banking on a response.. but it has encouraged me to share my story, because it is so isolating and confusing to be an adult and still feel like I did as a child with my mom. Of course, I have done MUCH therapy over the years (if I didn’t, I wouldn’t have known how to name my parents as narcissistic), and tried to heal by being an unconditionally loving mother to my two children. I cannot imagine treating them the way my parents did, and I am grateful that I can at least make that happen for them. I work with children with disabilities, and this is also very healing- I know I have the capacity to help others, to love, to give. Something my mother and father could never do. Bottom line is, despite the many tears and grief about my broken family, I have survived and managed to carve out my own network of loving people, two wonderful children of my own whom I adore, and a career which fills me with joy.

We can’t get back what we have lost, but perhaps losing it is the best thing that can happen to us. It doesn’t mean it doesn’t still hurt us. The harm is alive…Much love to you all who can relate and have been through the toxicity of emotionally damaged people who happened to give you life.

I'll have to budget to death but anything is better than being told I'm stupid, useless, will never amount to anything, getting yelled at without knowing the reason, getting yelled at with knowing the (usually miniscule) reason, getting intimidated, cornered and shamed e v e r y  d a y. 


I won't be able to see my cat anymore or at least not regularly which makes me more than sad because I've known him since I was 8, he's my soulmate.

I say ""my"" cat but he's technically the family's, so I can't take him, she's been explicitly telling me that under no circumstances I can take him with me. Probably to be cruel. She knows he's bonded to me and he gets depressed when I'm gone for a long time, but nothing brings her more joy than to be cruel and get a reaction out of me. Also, she can't care THAT MUCH about him, because every time there was something up with him I had to practically beg her to take him to the vet, also yearly checkups for an elderly cat are apparently useless... It's not like cats commonly develop cancers in the ears or eyes at that age...

What she found must have been ovulation sticks. I actually just can’t get my head around this and even though it’s been 8 years since she did this, I still feel SICK over it because it’s just such an invasion of privacy. To think she was looking through my bins when I wasn’t around and found evidence of us trying for a baby, it really makes me feel so uneasy. It makes me wonder what was she actually looking for?

It shouldn’t surprise me at all really because she looked through my bin when I was a kid A LOT. I remember I had a letter from a friend the once (I think I was like 11) and it was quite mean so I just ripped it up in to teenie tiny pieces and put it in my bin. She sat and taped every single piece back together so she could read it whilst I was at school. It didn’t hit me until I was an adult how strange this was. 

I can understand wanting to know if your kid is being bullied or something but she was obviously looking through my bin before she knew it was there and then to go to the extent of spending your afternoon taping the note back together, I mean like I really ripped that letter in to hundreds of pieces.

1o3v3eo,My mom’s been in and out of jail my whole life. Now she called CPS on me because I finally went no contact,"My mother has been in and out of jail for most of my life. I’m 35 now, a mother myself, and somehow she still finds ways to control, humiliate, and harass me. Every time I let her back in, she ruins my peace.

When I was 3, she took me to court in Virginia thinking she wouldn’t get arrested. She did, and I ended up in a jail cell with her until my grandfather drove from Harlem to get me. I lived with him until 5th grade. Then my mom came home, fought for custody, and won because I wanted to live with her. She went back to jail again in 7th grade.

Around that time, her fiancé moved in with us. When she went back to jail, she left me in his care. I was 12 years old. One day I woke up and he was gone too. After that, I was passed around by family and treated horribly. She came home again when I was in 10th grade. I graduated high school in 2008, went to college in 2009, and that same summer she went back to jail.

Before getting locked up, she’d have my dad, who was also in jail, call me to tell me she was trying to commit suicide because I wasn’t answering her calls enough. She lost her apartment, I became homeless, and lived on campus even during breaks. Eventually, I got kicked out after she made me drive overnight to court for an apartment I couldn’t save.

She came home again in 2012. I was living in Far Rockaway then. She moved in for six months, went back to jail, and I got kicked out again. I spent years bouncing around with friends, relatives, and even people my mother met in jail.

She came home again around 2015, and by 2016 I got arrested doing the same thing she used to do. I didn’t serve time, but I had to live with her in Albany afterward. She later moved in with my grandmother, who had dementia, and got locked up again for petty theft. My grandmother passed away while my mom was gone. She came home for good around 2017 or 2018.

I had my daughter in 2022, and that’s when her behavior turned into full-blown harassment. She’s lied to building staff to get into my apartment, threatened to call management to tell them my name isn’t on the lease, and dismissed my postpartum depression by saying, “you’ve been like that since you were 17.”

When I went through a breakup this year and asked her to watch my daughter for the weekend, she called the cops claiming she “found my daughter in the hallway” because I didn’t answer her calls, even though my daughter was with her the night before.

Since going no contact, she’s escalated. She’s contacted my father pretending to be suicidal so he’d guilt-trip me. Her friends text me from fake numbers saying, “Hey I think your mom blocked me, can you call her?” She’s shown up at my house uninvited, left letters under my door, and sent multiple emails acting like she just “misses us.”

Most recently, she showed up at my building again, standing in front of my elevator holding bags of applesauce and snacks, saying she came early so my daughter “wouldn’t see her.” She’s constantly trying to bait me with guilt or gifts after disrespecting my boundaries.

And now, after all that, she called CPS on me.

1o3udfm,Feeling really proud of my personal development after a lifetime of abuse and hardship.,"Hi everyone,

I don’t really know where I’m going with this but maybe it’ll resonate with someone.

My whole life’s been chaos. My mom has BPD, and I think my dad’s on the spectrum with narcissistic tendencies. My family’s filled with dysfunction — personality disorders, drugs, violence, enabling, you name it.

Growing up, I felt unseen and belittled. I was a straight-A, well-behaved kid. I was polite, hardworking, and praised by teachers but at home it was mostly abuse.

My dad worked long hours in a public safety job, angry and exhausted, taking it out on me.
Some examples:
- Threw me down stairs at 9 for not bringing the bins up.
- Beat me because my mom exaggerated small issues to trigger him.
- Threatened to kick me out over normal teenage stuff.
- Mocked me in front of friends, competed with me when I succeeded, made me do all the hard labor.

I don’t even hate him — I think he’s on the spectrum. I’ve cut contact, but he’s apologized before, so I’ve partially forgiven him. What hurts is how spineless he’s been with my domineering mom. I needed safety; he doubled down instead.

My mom’s BPD is the real monster no one talks about. She’s been in a 15-year midlife crisis.
Some examples:
- Constant criticism — “too skinny,” “too quiet,” etc., whatever triggered a reaction.
- No boundaries: read my journals, took my door off, dumped trash in my room, demanded social media access for control, stole my earned money behind my back.
- Berated me in enraged frenzies.
- Guilt-tripped and shifted blame constantly.
- Used me as emotional support against my dad, said she “should’ve married someone else.”
- Triangulated me and my singling against each other. 
- Forced kissing me on the lips even when I said no and blurred lines of consent. Slept in my bed unannounced often.
- Invited drug-addicted relatives who ruined holidays.
- Promised college help, then vanished.
- Lazy, manipulative, always the victim, and talked shit about me to anyone who’d listen.
- Unhinged when drinking heavily.
- Physically abused me as a child and would laugh about it.

By 17, I tried to kill myself by trying to slit my wrist artery after years of isolation and abuse. Wound up in a psych ward and hospital to heal the damage done. She blamed me for that too and told others about it like it was gossip. My therapist evaluated me with a psychiatrist and I don’t have any personality disorders. I was just depressed and helpless from my environment everyday. 

Since then, I’ve worked my ass off. Started working at 13, built a six-figure career by 25, live on my own, and have a healthy relationship. I’ve had 8 years of therapy and cut contact with my family. I focus on what’s in front of me instead of what’s behind me.

It took realizing that my “safety net” was never real. My therapist said it best: you can’t lose something you never had. Once I accepted that, everything clicked. I still grieve the fantasy of family, but I’m safe now. I even do a little dance sometimes just thinking about how far I’ve come.

I’ve recovered from an eating disorder (I am NBA point guard type of tall guy and was only 135 lbs), got in shape, built strong friendships, and learned how to communicate without people-pleasing. I went from silent and anxious to empathetic and assertive. it’s an art form if you come from chaos.

I don’t fear relapse or bad days because if I survived that home, I can survive anything. I’ve chosen not to die because now I finally have options. My parents’ toxicity doesn’t define my outcome.

Fuck you. If I die, I’m not going down without a fight😂

Life’s good. I’m about to go play golf, and I’m laughing at the absurdity of it all. Not manic, not coping; genuinely laughing because what the actual fuck was that first 20 years? 😂

If you’re in it now, please believe me that the day you come up for air will come. One day you’ll wake up safe, peaceful, and free. For me, that day was today, after two years no contact :)

tl;dr: bossed up on abusive parents and did everything they insisted was impossible for my whole life. that is all and just a positive story to share for inspiration and get off my chest.",ComfortableOk6989,1760185704.0,42,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o3udfm/feeling_really_proud_of_my_personal_development/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o3udfm/feeling_really_proud_of_my_personal_development/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o3u30b,Narc Father on the way out. Feeling Free.,"My narc father looks like he will be entering a nursing home. He is 88,  90% blind, has an eye infection, has skin cancers everywhere and, although he has a walking stick, he is unbalanced and liable to fall if he has no assistance. He is skin and bones as well due to a previous stomach cancer which he survived. He had a heart attack 20 years or so ago and survived that as well. It's only the good who die young.
 His physical blindness is interesting as he's always been 'blind', interiorly, so to speak.  He has always been a very small minded and intensely limited individual, with zero willingness to look inside and self- reflect on his own behaviour towards others. He showed no interest in me or anything I achieved as a child/teen. I felt as if I walked on eggshells around him (and around my mother too...that's another story!!).
He was prone to either complete and utter UNinterest in me,  or sullen and seething silence,or malevolent rage, with physical and emotional abuse thrown in and which seemingly came from nowhere.  
Topics of conversation were limited to the weather. That was it. 
The above description sums up his entire personality.  
 Even though I left home as a young person as soon as possible, the mental and emotional damage he did to me as a child and youth remained and, although physically absent, he has remained like a dark cloud over my life, colouring everything I did. I have spent a large part of my life in therapy. I never married, although I do have a few very close friends and our frienship is deep and spiritual. 
Sometimes wounds are invisible. It has been the emotional, anxiety induced, childhood wounds that lingered in me for so long. I was very mentally and emotionally awry as a young person and I've only really come into my own now, in middle age.I always wanted to be creative with music for example, and I finally have been able to do that. 
Anyway, I don't want to sound mean but I am so glad that my narc father is on the way out. I feel strangely liberated. It is as if a chain of dark, psychic energy between me and narcf has been severed at last.

1o3t0fw,shame about things I enjoy,"It’s very hard for me even to listen to music I like sometimes. My BPD/autistic father would bully me for liking to hear the same song over and over again. He is a big lover of music, some of which I also like. It’s hard for me to listen to certain music because it’s the kind he likes, that he would play when I was a kid. He is from the punk scene of the 80s and 90s and I have always felt he thought I was uncool or beneath him. He didn’t like my interest in Lisa Frank, Disney Princesses, My Little Pony or Barbie. Even though I’m a girl. It was like he disappointed that I liked those things. When I was bullied at school for things I enjoyed it was some child’s rationale, such as that I like “boy” anime (Astro Boy, Dragon Ball.) I could excuse that more easily than the shame of my father. I was afraid to watch the TV when he was home for fear of some belittling comment.

I am autistic and enjoy the same music, the same movie, over and over again. Even as an adult I still enjoy cartoons, manga, and toys. I used to feel tremendous shame for this and could only enjoy my media in private. I now have friends who are very supportive of my interests and will engage them with me which I’m grateful for. I still feel shame and guilt occasionally. I can never ever listen to my music out loud. It’s difficult even in the car.

1o3sp1u,Rant,"I just turned 17 and I live alone. After my parents got a divorce, my mom moved out of the house and soon my dad also moved out into a new house with his new wife . And well I’m now left alone in this family house . My mom never answers my calls , and my dad just comes to check on me once every few weeks , gives me an allowance etc. I’ve developed a routine , I cook , I do my laundry , I take care of the house .

I used to live with my mom but soon my relationship with my mom got really rocky . And it wasn’t even that I was being  rebellious or disobedient. after all I couldn’t be ,I was losing both parents at the same time I wanted nothing but to atleast make one of them care about me . She was just getting so overly controlling and it would snap something inside of her if i didn’t follow what she said even in really simple matters , it was to the extent that she’d get physically abusive.

For instance when a really bad fight was going on . I had an exam the following day and I was so mentally exhausted I genuinely didn’t feel like I was in the right mental state to go write that exam when I was staying up the whole past night dragged into their fight forced to be involved. She was furious at me for staying home. She was forcing me to go , threatened to call my teacher and she said and I quote “I’ll expose you ,the real you to them , they’ll know who you really are” she knew how much I cared about my teachers opinions (she did call him and embarrassed me , she was crying and shouting in the phone). She was shouting so loud , threatened to kill me ( I had locked myself in the bathroom after seeing her grab a wine bottle , I had a lot of earlier incidents of her beating me) and she went completely bizarre all over the fact that I didn’t go to school like she wanted me to  (keep in mind she never showed involvement in my studies , I’ve been a straight A student my whole life I’m not one to be scolded about school) . It’s like she’s trying to gain control over her life but controlling mine .

Anyhow I am really grateful that I’m not around both of them anymore , my father is also very manipulative. But at the same time my life now isn’t any better. I’m alone all the time , in a new place , I know nobody here and I’m struggling to make friends.

Like, mine never told me (that I can recall) “You’re stupid, we hate you” but they did these major mindf*cks. I remember telling my dad about a recent diagnosis and his first response was to mention a character in a show we had seen who claimed to have the same diagnosis but they were making it up. It took me years to realize he was implying *I* was making it up, or he wanted me to believe he thought that. Another one, they forbade me from playing sports- never “you can’t play sports!” but conveniently “forgot” paperwork to let me sign up, for 18 years. Then they would cut out pictures and articles of school athletes and teams from our local newspaper and tape them to the wall, several times a month for years.  This kind of thing is hard to describe to people when they ask “so what did your parents *do*?” Sure, there was plenty of neglect too and other more “obvious” abuse.

My mother did take care of basic hygiene and taught and demanded it from me, but for example, any extra self-care or trying to look good was seen as pointless and ridiculous. I only went to the hairdresser when it was time to get the bob and bangs cut, just as my mother wanted. My mother has laughed at me countless times when I started wearing makeup, or if my dark moustache hairs were visible next to bright red lipstick. Even now, as an adult, if I mention going to the hairdresser or getting a facial, she scoffs or rolls her eyes.

This behaviour has made me feel, all the way into adulthood, like I don’t deserve care or that I’m not valuable.

1o3qdtn,"Family events, financial leverage and narcissistic mothers and daughters","I just want to start out by saying I'm not sure whether my mother and father are narcissists or not. I don't think I'm qualified to make that diagnosis, but I get that distinct impression at the very least.

Basically my sister is a psycho and has created horrible situations of varying severity for our entire family but especially for me at almost every family event. It has gotten to the point where I no longer want to be around her or be at events where she is present, even being willing to sacrifice the opportunity to see my other siblings that I am either relatively close with or at least have a cordial relationship with just because I do not want to be around her anymore. To give an example, I have PTSD (partially as a result of my childhood and possible narcissistic parents of course) and my sister created a situation in which she triggered my PTSD and very much made me feel unsafe, as if something very serious was about to happen, like assault or the police being called, literally on the day of a very important holiday for no reason whatsoever. She made up horrible lies about me out of nowhere on that very day, when I was minding my own business and was trying my best to ignore her. This is the kind of person we are talking about, on top of the history of shit that has not been mentioned. 

So there is that. I guess some of you can see where I am going with this maybe, but ever since I told my mother (my father is in the picture, but I barely speak to him, I find him detestable, and generally he is another reason I would rather not be at family events) that I do not want to be places where she is unless serious efforts are made on her part to improve her behavior and seek professional mental help, my mom has run the gamut of gaslighting me, guilt tripping me, and now as of recently threatening me, as I have been relying on my parents for financial support as I am in college. Literally anything except validating what I feel and taking real steps to try to be some sort of matriarchal presence in this situation. Honestly, she has become another reason I would rather not be at family events. I have offered to speak with her through her therapist that I literally found for her, but she would rather pretend she did not hear it and continue to harass me. The most ironic thing of all is that they also financially supports my sister and would rather threaten me with removal of such support than leveraging that support to make her daughter get some fucking help. Go figure.

I know maybe some of you are thinking that I need to become financially independent as soon as possible, and I know, but that is literally what I am in college for. I have had part time jobs during college but in order for me to truly become independent from them I would either have to join the army or something or try to work full time. It is just not feasible for me at the moment. And some people, including one of my siblings, just tell me to suck it up and go so that my finances are not put at risk, but there is only so much compromising I can do. I am in a truly nightmare situation and honestly I have bad dreams about it. Like I barely dream anymore but the other night I had a literal nightmare about it. And the truth is that it is making me miss family events that I would rather be at. Next week is the birthday of someone very close to me and I am going to have to miss that because they are all going to be there and I am simply done with being around people who are fucking crazy, horribly disrespectful and do not know how to act like normal human beings. My parents in particular have used their financial support as a pass to do whatever the hell they want for far too long. I don't care whether you give me money or not, if you can't respect me on a basic level then why the hell would I ever be around you?

anyone else been in a situation like this? I guess I'm just mainly looking for people who have been through something similar and how you navigated it/how it made you feel, because I'm feeling a mix of a lot of very negative emotions from guilt and shame to intense fear and loathing. I have my own therapist but honestly it's become very difficult to focus on anything else. People close to me think that my mom is bluffing and is not actually going to cut off financial support, but I'm not sure. I guess the only thing I can do is just keep trying to focus on my life because it's the only way I'm going to be able to remove myself from such a situation to begin with.

1o3q095,My mom secretly took my message and is using it to manipulate the situation with my dad.,"I need some outside perspective on a painful family situation.

A while ago, I sent a message to a family friend who was trying to act as a mediator.
In that message, I explained what we’ve been through emotionally and why my sibling and I decided to stop seeing our parents.
I mentioned them and wrote, “they abused us.”
By “abuse,” I meant emotional and psychological abuse only — nothing else.

However, my mother secretly went through that person’s phone, found the message, and sent it to herself.
Now she’s twisting the word “abuse” and acting as if I accused my father of sexual abuse, even sending threatening messages to my husband.
But there was absolutely no such implication.

She also claims that my father was so affected by this that he attempted suicide and was hospitalized, but I honestly don’t know if that’s true given how manipulative this whole situation has become.

This has been extremely distressing for me, because my intention was never to harm anyone — I just wanted to speak honestly about the emotional and psychological impact of what we went through.

1o3pye7,A daughter of traumatized mother,"Hi everyone,
I’ve been reading here for a while but this is my first, second? time posting. I’m 18 and I grew up in a really controlling and abusive household. My father has always been emotionally and physically abusive, he insults, humiliates, and controls everything. My mom also suffered a lot from him, i was born after 13 years of marriage (im an only child) so obviously her staying with him was never my fault, and for years I tried to protect her and convince her that what he’s doing is wrong.
But over time, she started taking her pain out on me instead. She can be nice one moment and completely destroy me the next.
When she’s angry, she says the most painful things like that I’m a failure, that I have no brain, that our life is “shit” because of me, that I ruin everything beautiful, and that other mothers have daughters they’re proud of while she has me she also once told me she wishes she never had me (i was 16). Then she’ll suddenly act normal again as if nothing happened and syas the nicest things.
I understand that she’s traumatized. I really do. I feel empathy for her because she’s still stuck with my father and learned to survive by pleasing him. By the way in her relationship with my father she always says hiw much she hates him and that he ruined her life but she secretly seeks his validation she sometimes uses me to do that. I don’t know how to deal with her mood swings anymore. Every time something small goes wrong, she uses it to remind me of all my “failures.”
Recently, I got sick during an exam and didn’t do well on that one test, she comforted me at first, but the next day during another fight, she brought it up again and said I’ll fail at everything. She even said that our travel (where we came for my studies) was “shit” and that I’ll just end up failing and taht she will remind me of that later.
I don’t understand her anymore. I never feel like she’s truly proud of me, even when I do well. I feel like she only loves me when I make her feel good or when i tell her about how my friends mother's treats them and she wants to copy, and when I make even one mistake, I become the enemy.
I’m trying to stay strong. But emotionally, I feel like I’m collapsing. I don’t want to hate my mom I know she’s also a victim but she hurts me so much.
I wrote this story here to listen from different people than my community. I hope I listen to your stories and advices for my situation.

1o3p6op,My mom wont leave me alone,"Hi everyone,
I’m 23F, and for the past decade I’ve dealt with narcissistic abuse from my mom and grandpa. I grew up hearing that I was a loser and that my mom wished she had aborted me. It’s left me terrified of her, constantly anxious, and very lost about my own path in life.

When I turned 18, I just wanted to move away from home but the only way my mom agreed to support me was if I studied what she wanted. I hated it, but since she was paying for everything I kept quiet and tried to survive.

Recently, I started making my own money and decided not to enroll this year so I can save up and finally pay for a course I actually like. My plan was to be fully independent by December. But now my mom suddenly decided she’s coming to visit me and is demanding to go to my university to “make sure” I’m really studying.

I finally told her I don’t want to be controlled anymore and that I’m ready to take care of my own life. Her reaction was to call me ungrateful, a clown, and say I’ll never amount to anything because I’m “old.” It’s exhausting. My whole family sees me as a problem child even though I’ve always been responsible and hard‑working. Some even say I’ll “end up broke and pregnant,” which couldn’t be further from reality.

I just feel so defeated and anxious. I’m trying to build a life for myself and stop being afraid, but this constant guilt and pressure are eating me alive. I’d really appreciate some advice or support from anyone who’s gone through something similar.

1o3log3,An Incident with my Father I Think About a Lot,"This is an extension of a comment I made in another post. I don't want to hijack with this much self talk.  
  
\---  
  
Literally walked out of the shower and downstairs to my father screaming at the ceiling all manner of damning things about me and what he was going to do. He thought I had gone to *my friend's* house after school. First of all, there's nothing about having done that that would have warranted that kind of response from anyone. He was allowing himself to have a really sick tantrum about how he really felt about me, and no, I don't think he wanted to feel like I was enjoying my life somewhere else.

Stupid thing is, I wasn't enjoying my life even when I wasn't there. I was currently in a *friendship* with a person who lived on our street I thought I couldn't get away from. The person terrified me and also had a lot of control over me. It was something I really wanted to talk to my father, my would-be guardian and protector, about. But he was in the process of reminding me that he was another violent unsafe threat in an already violent, unsafe world.

It's actually the only time I ever heard him say the word sorry, the S-word, after he turned around and saw me standing there. ""Sorry, I didn't know you were here."" Not about what he was saying or how that **must** have made me feel. He was sorry to himself that he didn't realize I was within earshot. To anyone else he had any control over, me trying to explain that about him would be dramatically simplified into him just *losing his cool*. I can't remember how many times one of his enablers would say something like, ""He really loves you deep down. He just has a hard time showing it.""

No. He did not. He didn't even love himself. He did not understand or want to understand love, at all. Forever, too frightening not to avoid. Love is not a spontaneous intent. Wanting to love someone but not knowing how is not, in and of itself, love. True love can be shown. Love can be felt. Love is something that can be shared with someone or something, manifested in some meaningful way, or it isn't love. Desire isn't love. Possession isn't love. Projection isn't empathy. Love is not inherently selfless, but it is inclusive.

It's hard to bring a statement like, ""My father never loved me"" into the world and not be silenced for it, even when I see so many who've been neglected by the same coldness. Denial is such a wasteful and strong part of the human psyche that's unfortunately so encouraged and enabled in our society.",GlassMana,1760154735.0,2,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o3log3/an_incident_with_my_father_i_think_about_a_lot/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o3log3/an_incident_with_my_father_i_think_about_a_lot/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o3lliv,Dealing with body image issues due to a narcissistic parent,"I have always struggled with body image issues ever since I could remember. I was never ""super slim"" but I've always been average weight.

My mom has called me fat ever since I could remember. Sometimes I've been bigger, sometimes I've been smaller. 

But it got really bad a few years ago when I gained 100 pounds due to a medication that made me hungry and stunted my metabolism.

My mom makes me feel like my only worth is based on how I look. She is superificial and vain that if you are not the most facially attractive, or the most physically fit you are therefore unworthy of love. She is not a nice person. 

It is ironic because she is not the skinniest herself.

It has gotten so bad that even random strangers are now commenting on my weight gain. I had a random person at the bus stop call me a fat cow when I sat down at the bus stop today, completely unprovoked. It's like I just attract it wherever I go. It's become impossible.

Even my older brother is bullying me about my weight gain and making me feel bad about myself and I'm just sick and tired of it. I'm sick of tired of being treated like an object. I want people to know my real self, like my personality, things I care about politically, and all the things that really matter in this world. I'm sick and tired of being sexualized and treated like my only worth is other people's sexual gratification. It's just not right, and I would never do that to someone else. These people are sick.

I'm not saying that being super thin is bad, but it's not even natural for women to be super skinny. It's a genetic rarity.

my nmom would also give me situations, like ""i said XYZ to your sister, and she did ABC back, so i did 123, was i in the wrong?"" basically giving me her narc narrative and asking me to validate and support her through my own sister (who i loved) in cutting her off. obviously i had to side with my mother, but when i didn't, my mother would take it as ""taking my sisters side"" and not supporting my mother

  
i never realised how much this made me mature when i was young. a child should not have to be responsible for their adults decisions and emotional wellbeing.

I knew it would be extremely difficult but I didn't imagine this. My step dad even warned me that no matter what he does its always wrong so be careful. 

I've had to mind everything I do and walk on eggshells (more like landmines). Ive tried to do everything to help and be easy but it doesn't matter. No matter what I say she's angry or upset. Today we got in an argument because I wouldn't change our flight last minute to go home today (within 4 hours of the flight and the airport is an hour away). I've also been sleep deprived because she doesn't let me sleep.

She just seemed to get worse after the drive to st pete and we got into an argument over me wanting to go drive around st pete for a while when she was napping(our flight is tomorrow morning). I tried to do what she wanted but she was still unhappy and she started gaslighting me and yelling and trying to confuse me. I suggested we go to the beach (the hotel is on the beach) and apparently I'm an asshole for enjoying the beach. She also mentioned going on the beach before that so idk. 

All of this has been making me have flashbacks of my childhood. She finally told me to leave so I started packing my things and sobbing and she rushed to me and started saying no please I love you we have to talk about this don't leave. You can't go without me. And hugging me and saying sorry. 

She physically wouldn't let me leave. I called my friend while she was in the bathroom because I was shaking and so afraid. I feel like a hostage and I don't know what to do. She's back to pretending everything is ok now and like normal. But I'm just following her around terrified and trying to say the right thing so she doesn't ditch me somewhere 😥

I still feel so scared. I don't know what I did and where my mom went. I felt so weird and almost disgusted that she rushed to me and tried to make it better. Im so confused and terrified I'll do something again. I feel so much regret and shame and sadness. I feel like I'm just a burden and I don't know why she wanted me around just to bully me.

I think my dad is bipolar because around once to twice a week he has these manic episodes where anything can set him off. He always blames us calling us retarted, shaming our weight, or even tell us we’re selfish. Every time he does this he threatens to unalive himself, and that his life is worthless because we don’t contribute nothing to this world. My mother tries her best, but doesn’t help with the situations, and sometimes it infuriates him even more telling us that she’s worthless and should go die. During these episodes he will throw things around, and damage this in the process. Every time he walks past me I flinch thinking that he will punch my side, or he will make fun of my weight. I feel terrible for my mother because he shames her the most he will go out of her way to make sure she knows she’s not worth living, and should go die. Every day he will bash her cooking even if it’s good, and he will blame her for everything that happens in our house, and blame for for the reason we’re not good people. Yesterday I had messaged my grandma if she could make my dad’s favorite soup because he isint feeling well, and today at home he blew up at me for telling her that. And I should never do that again. He also didn’t know that we were coming home when we always come home at this time, and got food for the rest of the family except for my sister and I, and he blew up that no one tells him anything.

1o3kfd1,On the run from my narcissistic uncle,"I have no idea what to do. 

About a year ago my bio dad died and my n grandparents (adoptive parents) took out a life insurance policy on him and said they would give me 2k. 

March 12 my ndad/Grandpa tried to kill me. I don't know why still. There was a case where the state was investigating and pressing charges for years of abuse that I was not involved in.

About 2 months after I ran to another city and asked for that money. They gave me some but were acting very suspicious and contemptuous. It was a fit of desperation. I developed full fledged narcolepsy from the stress and was on the street (this has been confirmed by several doctors). I was constantly falling asleep and fainting. I am also at risk of a heart arrhythmia that I need to get looked at but have had the chance.

In desperation I begged, pleaded, argued for that money. I knew I wasnt going to survive on the streets and I had about 2 confirmed minor heart attacks in the same month. My family besides my grandparents told me I wasn't owed any of that money and refused to help in any kind of way. My n grandparents only did it because we had the cops go and talk to them for us to reduce their charges.

My uncle texted my friend/caregiver that he was going to tap my phone and send private investigators after us if I wasn't committed on a 72 hour hold since apparently I'm a crack addict like my biodad. Well, I did go to the hospital but they found no signs of psychosis. He threatened to press charges on my friend/caregiver for attempted kidnapping of me. Making the obvious lie I ran in a vulnerable state and he was manipulating me (I have a level 2 autism diagnosis). 

We ran AGAIN, and he came looking for us in another state. No shelter will take me with a caregiver. I'm still passing out without my meds. The cops are involved and we have no idea what he wants as I haven't contacted my n grandparents or my uncle in 2 months. I can't be alone because of my heart condition and I can't work either.

1o3jit0,NMom is breaking up with me,"This is long, as I need advice on whether to continue this email exchange or just stop. I’ll out nmom’a and my emails in the comments in order. 

For context- 

I’ve been VLC (replying “Happy Mother’s Day” by email, for example) for two years since nMom tried to break up my marriage with a false affair accusation ten days after my husband gave his best friend’s eulogy. 

She sent me an email entitled “I’m done” yesterday. And I replied, explains yet again why I am taking space . She’s acting surprised about “how I really feel” even though we had three or four conversations about how her behavior hurts me, 5-6 emails in the topic, and one three hour conversation between her and my husband before I went VLC.

Regarding the content of her email- every “good action” see cited in my adult life has a dark side she is just ignoring. Moving me into school, was on the premise that we were both moving across our country to start over without alcoholic edad. We we house hunting, she out down a deposit, and I picked my school based on being with her. After I accept the school and rejected the others, she rugged pulled me, got her despit back and moved back across the country to move in with alcoholic edad again. Abandoning me in a city where I knew no one. 

Same thing with the “taking care of you during c-section.” She forced me to leave the hospital by threatening to leave my preschoolers alone in a rented apartment in a city where we knew no one, because we needed specialist care there, and could not even get a stranger to babysit because it was the height of lockdowns in 2020. She was mad that the baby stayed in until 42 weeks and forced me to leave against doctors orders so she would get to see the baby before flying home despite lockdown.  For some reason she thought the baby would come at 38 weeks and she’d get to snuggle her for 6 weeks even though I’ve never gone into labor that early. 

Oh- also the “health problems” in the FYI postscript are her having low thyroid function. My aunt’s “cancer” was having colon polyps removed. And mom’s “radiation for skin cancer” was basal cell carcinoma, which my husband has had removed twice and was minor enough surgery/zapping that we never even told anyone about it. Like it wasn’t pretty, but it’s not deadly or disabling. 

Should I bother responding? Just feeling very sad.

1o3i392,Nmom and Family Therapy,"Hello all, I’ve been estranged from my Ndad and Nmom for over a year with minimal contact after they offered to sell my family my childhood home and then kicked us out once we moved in. The last time my mother and I texted was to let her know if she wanted to repair the relationship we would need to go to consistent family therapy but any relationship with my father was severed. This was 6 months ago. 

My Nmom reached out today to ask me what I expect to get out of family therapy. The long and short I replied was it would work to repair a relationship but would only go as far as she was willing to put into it. To which she immediately responded she wanted to only go to a Christian therapist if she was to do it at all. The thing is, I have heavy religious trauma growing up Catholic and am an atheist. I declined, as I do not see how seeking out a religious slanted therapist would help us find common ground without bias, and I can’t be certain she isn’t looking for someone more sympathetic to her reasoning as a “good Christian woman”. I believe she’s looking for someone to say she’s right rather than she’s looking for any form of relationship repair.

The issue is, my husband disagrees. He’s been extremely supportive of me in my independence but he sees this differently. He thinks it now gives them the excuse of “now they’ve tried everything” and can finally be the victims they needed to be to justify their behavior. But in all honesty, I’m the eternal optimist. With my parents I have always been the “this time it will be different” kid. I can’t trust I won’t go to these sessions and once I see a glimmer of hope I’ll fall right back in and I feel like seeing a Christian-only therapist won’t endeavor to create that hope even if it’s fleeting.

1o3i0jj,Never-ending guilt trips and more,"Sorry, just a nice long-winded rant that I've got to get out:

It's Thanksgiving in Canada this weekend, and for this first time in my life I am not going to my parents' house for it. Work is getting absolutely crazy and I know that I'm going to be cooked by the end of the busy season. I need the weekend to relax and ground myself before I get caught up in the chaos. Last Christmas was also a hellish affair. I didn't have it in me to avoid Easter (the guilt trips won), but I can't deal with whatever bullshit my mother has in store this weekend. It will wreck my mentally.

My decision has gone over rather poorly with my mother. I told her at least a month ago I probably wasn't coming for Thanksgiving, citing work and some other plans as an excuse. At the time she seemed shockingly understanding. Well, she called me today ""to talk"". The guilt trips started right away. They were doing Thanksgiving on Sunday because of me (I never asked them to). Now I wasn't going and my sister-in-law was going to her parents' place because they have their Thanksgiving on Sunday. If it wasn't for my aunt and uncle (who come with their own set of quirks), my mother (and father) would be ""all alone on Thanksgiving""! She mentioned the massive turkey that they bought, how they bought certain sides for me, and how they were baking a special pie just for me. I never asked for any of this. In fact, at the first mention of Thanksgiving I said I might not be able to make it. 

Then she start in on other guilt trips. My cousin just got married, and I wasn't invited to the wedding (although I suspect my mother said I wouldn't come before invites even went out). She is now on my case to chip in for a wedding and shower gift. She event went so far as telling my cousin to cross my name off of the card if I didn't end up paying my mother within a certain time frame. I'm trying to take care of myself. I have things that I need to pay for and take care of before I can pitch in way too much money for some shit my mom ordered from Wish. Again, I wasn't invited to this wedding. Don't even know when or where it was to be honest. 

Other attempted guilt trips from the call included telling me that their new dog wanted to see me and how he would be so sad that I wasn't there and asking me if I was going to bother showing up at Christmas (because she's ""having surgery and won't be able to do anything!""). She ended the call by telling me to call on Thanksgiving and saying it wasn't too late for me to change my mind and come over for turkey. 

I hope to god she was drunk, otherwise I'm concerned that she's got dementia or something else. She would ask me about what my work schedule looked like. I told her in great detail all of the projects I had coming up and all the places I would be traveling to. After all that, she would ask me if I was going to be out of town at all. She would cut me off while I was talking to yell at my dad or talk to her dogs. She would ask me a question and not even let me answer it. I can't tell if she's not listening, or if she's not retaining anything. 

This phone call just solidified my choice to avoid my parents' house like the plague. At the same time, I don't understand why this whole ordeal is causing me so much pain or whatever it is I'm feeling right now.

1o3hqep,Self centered mother has ruined my life it hurts me 19F,"Hello, I’d like to share my experience and story, with the hopes of some advice and ways to navigate. I am 19F and my parents were happily married up until the year 2019. My father and I traumatically found out that my mother was cheating on him for years with a “friend”. This “friend” is now my mom’s husband and I technically live with them and my father lives not too far from me. My father has been my best friend since I was young but we’ve been closer than ever since the moment we found out my mother was having this affair back in 2019. Her husband and I get along, but it’s difficult to be around him for long periods of time bc of what he’s done , he broke up the wonderful family I was once a part of, and he is awkward and definitely a downgrade to my father in all aspects. From time to time my mother’s husband will scream at me and lash out over really childish things and teams up with my mother on a lot. My mother used to be different when I was younger, but ever since she betrayed me and my father I’ve looked at her differently, she is very different than me, she embarrasses me in a negative way around friends and family, stating that “I’ll never be able to live on my own” or trying to tell me what a person should be like when I’m dating, She constantly brings up how her life is so much better than when she was with my father, whereas my father is the one who has always been loyal to my mother and misses the old life we all once had. My mother is a drinker and that definitely has gotten worse as she’s with her husband and she always didn’t like that my father drank, but my father stopped drinking 16 years ago, and she has continued to drink. She is very different from most of my friends parents and others I know. She has a weird hatred for my father when he didn’t do anything and she is the one that betrayed him, rather than working it out. She’s very anti religious and as someone that’s been involved and growing in their Christianity/Catholicism, it’s painful to listen to the derogatory comments she and her husband say to me. It’s also been the reason some of my past boyfriends and friends have started to dislike my family. My father has now after many years found someone he is in love with and i couldn’t be happier for him, he deserves the world, after he was betrayed by my mother. My mother is not like me at all, she is very frugal and I have made the decision to go away for school after finally talking with my father and my father wants me to go away and enjoy my time at college and have fun and do well, whereas my mother can’t seem to grasp it. My mother and her husband are also moving to a different state next year and just abruptly told me this recently, and they don’t seem to wait for me and for me to get out of college , they are just pretty self centered and don’t have care for me in the ways parents normally should. I know my father is not going anywhere and if he was he would have me go with him, he goes where I go and if he is with a woman that I don’t like, he doesn’t continue to be with them, he prioritizes me over everything and always has been here for me, lets me vent, and supports me because he has also seen and heard how different my mother is. I apologize if some of this doesn’t make sense, it’s been like this for years, it’s hard to get my mother and her husband’s thoughts out of my head and their reactions, because it’s always there in my mind and follows me, and I live with it. They make me feel so guilty about hanging out with friends, my own father, guys, other people, they also find a way to tie it back to how I should’ve been hanging out with them instead of doing xyz. I’m in school, finishing up my degree to transfer to a university, maintaining two jobs, a social life, and time for myself. I have just always felt so much anger,pain, and frustration from my self centered mother and her husband that she thinks is so great, when in reality, he hurt two people, my father and I and we live with that trauma and flashbacks everyday. It’s easier for him than me, I live with them and it’s hard, but my mom claims it’s normal for “divorced life to live with their mom” and I know for a fact my mother and her husband will despise me and hate me for the rest of my life if I move out or just pack up my things and go live with my dad, the one who understands, and helps support me.

1o3fup2,NMom stole money from me.,"I(30F) have been NC with my birth giver for about 3 years now. I am gonna be honest, life has not been easy for me the last 22 months. I lost my job and went 20 months without a stable income. I finally got a new job last month that pays really well! I was so excited to fix my credit score and build my savings back up. 

I have always been good with money and budgeting. I know approximately how much is in my account, give or take around $50. I leave work a bit early today due to not feeling so well, and I think I am gonna order some Chinese food for some soup to help my body feel better. I go to check my account to see how much I have before ordering to make sure no surprise bill happened or anything, and I see $452.10 has been withdrawn from my account! I called the bank, assuming this was fraud. 

I talk to them and find out, nope! It was my mother whose name was still legally on the account as a co-owner. I have had that account since I was a minor, and I didn't realize she was on there.   
  
I tried to take her off, but I would need her permission to do that since she is a co-owner, and she would need to sign papers... fuck, that's not happening, and I am not breaking no contact, my only other option is to close the account. Honestly, that sounds like a good idea. I have already started the process of transferring the funds out of that account (won't be done for another 6 days, according to SoFi), and I have sent a message to hr at my work to change the bank account for direct deposits.

Uses excuses like: ""im just stressed out, i have a lot going on, im tired, blah blah blah."" to divert the attention away from her behavior, and to also try and justify it. She'll also use me as an emotional dumping ground while disregarding my boundaries, ill tell her flat out that ""I dont walk to talk right now"" and she will literally pressure me and guilt trip me into ""talking"" to her, ""talking"" = talking AT me, incessantly complaining about every little thing, talking shit about everyone, and repeating herself over, and over, AND OVER !! oh my gosh its actually driving me crazy just thinking about it.

Oh and she'll accuse me of yelling at her when Im speaking calmly with the most monotone voice imaginable, but I just so happen to be telling her to stop doing something.

1o3dahb,E-Mom may have cancer and I'm not okay.,"My E-Mom (69 f) told me this week she's been having health issues and may have uterine cancer which may require a hysterectomy. She's not the healthiest, considering she's never divorced my n-dad who is the most toxic man alive. She's always put others first. 

I'm currently low contact with her and no contact with my father and n-sister. I have no other siblings. I'm absolutely dreading going for a visit because I know it's going to be used as an excuse to try and get my dad and sister to talk to me again. 

I am also just dreading her having to be sick in an environment with such low empathy people like my father and sister. They already mistreat her and I can't stand the thought of it. 

It so hard because I know she's an adult and has made her bed and needs to lay in it. But I can't help but feel neglectful since I've left her there with them.

1o3cubr,AITA for not wanting to talk to or comfort my grieving mother?,"My step father died yesterday. He hasn’t been doing good for a while now and it was just his time. I don’t know or care what I believe in religiously, but regardless he is in a better place now whatever that means or looks like. Even though he was just my stepdad, he was the most father-like figure in all of my life and for all intent and purposes he was my dad. He fully believed, cared, and acted like my siblings and I were his biological-true children. He loved us just as much as his actual biological children. I can’t express enough how amazing of a person he was and how much myself and everyone looked up to him. I was very close with him and could literally tell him anything without fear of judgement.

Before dad passed, I was on next-to no contact with my nMom for a few months which unfortunately included him because she would use his phone to call me. She knew I would answer his calls and not hers. Dad and I would talk about her anytime she wasn’t around and he felt safe to. He found out over the years, it was easier to shut up out of fear and to just make her happy rather than to “ruffle feathers” as he would say. He was more so one of her many victims than abetting her. I did A LOT of standing up for him, that likely ended up in more verbal abuse for him in the end. (I’m so sorry dad.) She is a very manipulative and nasty mean person who suffers from bipolar disorder, severe depression, anxiety and PTSD (there is more there that hasn’t been officially diagnosed including her narcissistic personality, but I will leave it at what has been diagnosed). I made very clear to my nMom that I did not like the way she treated me, all the kids(including step kids), and dad, therefore I needed space. She would routinely break my clear boundaries I had set every few weeks to say something hurtful or accuse me of something, then in the same breath ask why I was doing this to them. One of these times, she made my dad (who had recently two toes amputated and a sensitively healing open wound— he was in a nursing home, but dad requested to continue all his appointments from home — he was so sick of hospitals/nursing homes by this point) walk back and forth from the car to my front door STEP (yes there was a small step that he could hardly get up the one step without completely losing his balance even with his walker) all because she couldn’t face me/I was being “too mean” and “made her upset” that I wouldn’t talk to her. 

I got the call at 2 am that dad had passed and since I was less than 5 minutes from the hospital, I was there very quickly. My mother and I hugged his body until he went cold. She was already starting to act and say really weird/off/hurtful things, but I gave her full benefit of the doubt because she was already actively mourning deeply. She didn’t want to be alone, so for the first time in months, she came over to my house and stayed the night. 

When we “woke up” after each getting maybe an hour or two of what I would loosely describe as sleep, I was deeply numb and left with all the hurt I still had from my mother standing face to face with her again. She continued to make weird comments that just made me uncomfortable. I sat outside with my cup of coffee like dad and I would do when he still physically could. He liked to either be alone or knew I would sit out there and just be quiet with him. Eventually we would chat after the coffee soaked in, but we could be just be peacefully quiet and still really enjoy each other’s company. Thats just the kind of guy my dad was. When mom found me outside with my coffee she got upset and left, saying we(my husband and I) “didn’t want her there.” At no point did I say that, in fact we had invited her to stay the night with us, so we were really confused.

Over the course of the day, I’m getting numerous texts, calls, emails, posts, comments, and people stopping by. Some asking questions, some wanting hugs/comfort, and some just talking about good times with dad. Everyone grieving in their own ways. Note: I’m 28F and I’ve never had anyone die in my life. My maternal grandma died young when my mother was still a baby, and everyone else just didn’t exist in my life. We didn’t know them or my then single-mother kept them from my brother and I for some dumb grudge or whatever her reasoning is; we have a very tight circle between the three of us before she met dad. So the grieving process is entirely new to me and I don’t know what to do or how any of it works. 

Still on the same brutally long day dad passed, my mother requested to come over again later in the day and was very unclear about why, what for, or when. I was clearly hesitant but I said yes. She came over, we gave her hugs at the door, sat down, and then she immediately got upset again, restating the “didn’t want her here” narrative, said I “wouldn’t look at her,” and left after no more than 1 minute of being in my house. She called several times asking “going forward, are we never going to talk again?” and telling me that “we’re all just grieving” hanging up on me every time. 

My nMom has a sister whom she is not speaking with and has her blocked right now. Mom wouldn’t even tell her sister that dad had passed when mom was making all the calls. I had to tell her. I was scared my nMom would cut me off further, not letting me have anything of my dad’s to remember him by and preventing me from going to his service/memorial. It’s been established that my mom is fortunately not in control of dad’s service, that no one is “uninvited” from going to it, and that someone(my siblings) will make sure I have something of dads(a shirt, a hat) to remember him by. My stepsister has also confirmed that she will keep me and my aunt informed on anything related to the memorial/service. I’m still concerned with how erratic my nMom is acting, she will do something rash like destroy, get rid of, or sell some of my dad’s things without talking to anyone. My aunt has confirmed she is also concerned and has done a similar behavior in the past with items lended to my mother. 

Today is the next day, my mother had a whole sob-story about asking/needing to “calmly talk to me” as if I’m the one stirring things up. I told her I’m not comfortable talking to her without someone else present. Both nearby siblings were busy today, but agreed that this Sunday would be a good time for everyone (both siblings) to get together for all of us to talk. My mother did not like this and proceeded to send me multiple texts and call me several times demanding to talk to specifically me right now. In the past, she likes to call and demand that she be “taken off of speakerphone” where my husband could hear her. She immediately dives into her manipulative tactics, this time preying on mine/her grieving and “just resolving this” because she “needs me.” It’s also clear to me that mom is withholding letting me have a shirt/hat without “making peace” with her first. She won’t let anyone come over to her house right now since multiple people have discussed wanting something of dad’s or securing an item on my behalf. Her grieving has made her especially erratic at least towards me(possibly towards others too that she already wasn’t on good-terms with). 

I’m not hopeful that any discussion Sunday would do any good for my mother and I’d relationship at least. She is not listening to what I have to say, rolling right over any reasonable accountability, and just wanting to get to the part where we are talking again. In the past, unfortunately I have caved I what I naively thought was being the bigger person to just apologize and move on. She knows I am weak to her emotional narratives of “just needing her daughter,” “her baby” because I was the one to front the emotional dump of all her adult real-world problems as a very young child wiser beyond my years at the time. Now, I’m exhausted, burn out, hurt, tired of “being the bigger person”, tired of just accepting her behavior, tired of not saying something, tired of not sticking to my beliefs/opinions/boundaries. I’m traumatized to her flippant, emotionally manipulative, erratic behavior where I’m scared of every phone call, text, and car that pulls up in my driveway. So I ask you Reddit, am I just being an asshole daughter not supporting her mother during her time of grieving?

1o3bppy,"My sister went no contact with my nMom almost a year ago. My mom still doesn't accept that, and is still trying to get me and my brother to be her flying monkeys.","Sorry in advance for the long post, there's a lot I want to get off my chest.

So almost a year ago now my sister went no contact with my parents. My mother is a textbook narcissist who is completely incapable of self-reflection or accountability, and my dad completely enables her and has never and will never stand up to her, or for us, his children. My sister, her husband, and their child (my nephew) moved in with them when my nephew was a baby, and they helped raise him. But last year she and her husband were finally pushed to their breaking point, mostly due to my mom's unhealthy obsession with food.

My mom gets weirdly obsessed with what people eat or don't eat. My nephew is a picky eater, like most kids, and she would keep insisting he try different things and not take no for an answer, my sister would get mad, and she'd be like ""what, I'm just trying to get him to try it, he might like it, I'm not doing anything wrong."" But she would keep pushing relentlessly. Side note, me and my siblings were all fat kids growing up, and all still have weight issues and food-related issues. My mom was obese when we were growing up and has since had gastric bypass surgery and is now normal weight. But she obviously still has food issues, but she just pushed them onto everyone else instead. I can't ever confirm it, but I suspect she made us fat as kids on purpose, and tries to keep us fat now, maybe to make herself look better, I dunno. But I digress.

So anyway, my sister went no contact with my parents and moved out, blocked them on everything, and didn't give them their new address. My brother and I have chosen to remain in contact with my parents, but we are both very low contact. It helps a lot that they live in a different state. We are also still in contact with my sister, and actually, we have all three bonded as siblings even more over the realization that mom is a narcissist. We've had a lot of conversations about our various roles as ""golden child"" ""peacekeeper"" ""scapegoat"" etc. throughout the years, and how those roles even changed at various times.

It's actually been really great how much my siblings and I have bonded lately. It's healed a lot of trauma for me, finally being close to my big sister, and realizing that my mother was often the one pitting us against each other when we were children. Realizing this stuff about my mother has been like lifting a veil, it's all so obvious now. I'm still coming to terms with a lot of it, but she has no power over me anymore, and it's so freeing.

So my sister went no contact, and explained very clearly to my parents that she needed space and time and that she wanted them to leave her alone until she was ready to talk. Completely reasonable, should be no problem, right? Well, not if your mom is a narcissist. ""No"" doesn't mean ""no"" to my mom, it means ""keep pushing and maybe they'll eventually give in."" So she kept reaching out in every way she could, getting blocked every single time but also not getting the hint every single time. Then when she exhausted all of that, she unleashed her flying monkeys, and my aunt (my mom's twin sister) started harassing my sister, until she too was blocked.

Throughout all of this, my mom kept trying to get me and my brother to intervene. At first we kept trying to tell her to just give my sister space like she'd asked, telling her she was making things worse for herself, but of course she didn't listen. We told her we didn't want to be involved in it and we wouldn't be her ""spies"" telling her all the news she was ""missing out on.""

She of course never listens. Last night she sent a message to me and my brother, we responded this morning and this was the conversation:

>Mom: see if you can get me \[nephew\]’s wishlist for his birthday please, if she’ll allow gifts from us. TIA

>Me: no, and please stop trying to use us to get to \[sister\]

>Mom: I have no way to send \[nephew\] gifts. How is this fair? He’s going to think we abandoned him. Are we dead to her? can’t you tell us what he wants? why is that wrong? I don’t want to talk with \[sister\] at all. This is about \[nephew\] and our relationship. If she’s killed it we need to know so we can move on

>Brother: Please stop trying to use us to get to \[sister\].

>Mom: are you not reading my words? We don’t want contact with \[sister\]. It’s been 10 months since we saw \[nephew\]. You don’t seem to fathom how deep our grief is. Even if you won’t help, you could offer me support and understanding. years may go by

>Me: your relationship with them is between you and them. We are not going to be your go-between. Please stop trying to drag us into the middle of all this. We love you. I'm sorry you are going through this hardship right now. But this does not involve me and \[brother\].

>Mom: well it has certainly affected our relationship. Sides have formed and the estrangement feels final. sorry I reached out

There's still a part of me that thinks if I can just say the right thing, show her the right video, something, then I might be able to get her to finally realize. But I know that no matter how long I hold up the mirror to her, she will never look. It just makes me sad.

Reading other people's stories here makes me feel a lot less alone and a lot more understood. Maybe my story will make someone else feel less alone.

I hate the fact that this subreddit has to exist. But I am grateful that it does.

1o3bmoz,is everyone in your immediate family a narcissist?,"recently discovered that *every person* in my immediate family is a narc. my entire family (me, brother, mom) banded around shitting over my ndad for his unpleasantness when i was a kid, and after my parents divorced i turned into my nmom & nbrother’s scapegoat instead because i’m a lot like my father (minus the evil, of course) & was extremely upset and suicidal because of everyone’s treatment of me, which only proved their point that i was a bad person. i only recently realized that my brother very much took after my dad, and my mom is a vulnerable narcissist, and this has been kind of a reality-shattering revelation considering how much of my childhood i spent obsessing over NPD, how much my family bonded over hating narcissists, and i spent so much time believing that i myself had it based on their treatment of me (ironic!!!) and was obsessive over “fixing my narc traits” so they’d love me 🫠 my childhood was super lonely and miserable because i believed they hated me, all while being gaslit into feeling guilty for thinking they hated me. does anyone else have a family where *everyone* was a narc and there was absolutely no safe person at all?

1o3bj2a,Disowned by Narc father/side of family. Heart hurts/breaking attachment,"Just need a little support, I guess. Been NC with my narcissistic father and his side of the family for 5-6 months now. My grandmother (who I wasn't very close to, a narc herself) passed away. The family still expected me to show up to the funeral, which I did not. My sister, who is the only I still talk to on rare occasion, told me that it wouldn't be wise for me to ever show my face again.

I knew that if I attended, they'd try to gaslight, guilt, shame, and use me as the scapegoat that they have for nearly 28 years now. I chose to grieve my own way, and I'm at least glad my grandmother is at peace and not harming anyone anymore.

I guess the enmeshment and attachment to the family breaking is what's causing my heart to hurt so much. Maybe it's the programming and the family system inside me that's making me feel so awful.

Anyone been through something like this? I just feel like dying right now. Trying to console my inner child but I can't lie, I feel absolutely sick and terrible.

1o3asa9,Has anyone else needed space…from everyone?,"So I recently woke up. I (39/m) am finally in the process of discovering who I am outside of my Nmom and the unhealthy family dynamics that have shaped my whole life. I know I need low or no contact with her and my avoidant/emotionally immature father for my own peace.

Right now, though, I don’t want to interact with anyone I know (except my partner, who’s safe, supportive and amazing without imposing codependency). Other people I care about feel draining, like there’s still some kind of codependent or unhealthy undercurrent. I feel safest and most at ease being alone or around total strangers.

I have Lyme disease (which I can't seem to get rid of despite antibiotics and treatment) and chronic inflammation. My nervous system feels completely fried. I believe that because of my upbringing I’m constantly scanning for threats, reading tone, managing everyone else’s emotions and feeling ashamed about existing perhaps? Whatever it is, I just can’t do it anymore. It’s exhausting.

Anyway, I’m sort of impulsively heading to Europe by myself now for a three week retreat. I’ll still be working, but I’ll be alone, recharging and trying to figure out who I am/next steps without constant stress.

Has anyone else taken a long break from everyone after stepping back from a toxic parent? How did you deal with the exhaustion, guilt and loneliness while still prioritizing yourself?

1o39h8p,Am I overreacting?,"I’m not sure where else to go for advice. I’ve tried therapy, but I’ve honestly been scared to even talk about it because I feel like i’m just overreacting. Also possible trigger warning for some sexual content.

I (21F) don’t have the greatest relationship with my mom. She does a lot of things to not respect my boundaries that make me feel very vulnerable and uncomfortable. I want to know if these things are actually concerning or if I am overreacting.

When I was a child, my mom showered with me pretty much until I was old enough where we both couldn’t fit in the shower anymore. I was probably middle school age. She also insisted on picking out all of my clothing until high school and being controlling in other ways. I have memories of her exposing her genitalia to me, not in an explicitly “sexual” context, but I still saw it. I also remember her making me lay on her lap and applying some kind of ointment or cream on my genitalia every night, even when I was well old enough to be doing it myself. It made me feel very vulnerable and exposed as a child. 

I’ve never really had privacy while using the bathroom, showering, or changing-even now as an adult. Nearly every time I’m in the bathroom at home, she barges in. She always comes in trying to talk to me about menial things that could clearly wait until i’m finished showering or using the restroom. She will even open the shower curtain while i’m in there and offer to shampoo my hair or wash my back. She makes a lot of comments about me having acne on my back (I’m an athlete. I sweat. It’s going to be there).

She has this obsession with buying me clothes and picking them out for me and literally putting our family into credit card debt from online shopping (a whole other issue). Whenever I have to come home for breaks she always wants me to try on all the clothes she picks out for me. She often watches me change, even when I have no bra on. She adjusts the clothing around my chest and butt area without asking. She will “smooth out” the clothes by touching me and will sometimes even start taking the clothes off of me once i’m finished trying them on. It makes me uncomfortable and I have told her things like “please don’t touch my butt” and yet, it still happens. 

She also complains whenever my clothing is “inappropriate” - too low cut, too short, or too tight. Whenever my clothes aren’t up to her standards, she will adjust the clothing by my chest or pull it down at the hem. She tells me not to “dress like a Hoochie” and always lets me know when she thinks something is too tight or I need to wear my shape wear. She will also touch my hair when she thinks it’s frizzy.

I just feel very embarrassed about it and like I have no autonomy. I also know that other people have had it far worse than me and I don’t want to seem ungrateful or anything. Am I overreacting or is it fair that these things make me uncomfortable?

1o38trf,Can someone explain why I don't like it when my Ndad praises me?,"I read an interesting psychology today article that stated that narcissists use excessive praise as a weapon. My dad always told me I was the smartest person ever (I'm not) and other huge statements like that, which sounds great in theory but it always kind of bothered me for reasons that I could never understand. Maybe it's because I felt like I was only ""allowed"" to be smart growing up and everything else I did was made fun of. Driving, sports, skiing, even just moving around the house would get made fun of. Can anyone else relate to having an Nparent who showers you in praise, even with other people, but actually treats you kind of badly at the same time?

Some background on the mean behavior: My dad asked me last night ""if I still drink like I used to"" (and I absolutely have never had a problem with drinking, I literally had a glass of wine with my husband and him at lunch once and he has never let it go) and takes credit for all of my achievements. My dad put me in school a year and a half early so that he could brag his child was a genius, and after my mom died when I was 4, he never remarried and asserted that him taking me to random school nurses for chats about the female body a few times (I don't even remember it happening) should have made up for not having a mother.

1o38ny0,My mom screamed at me for not wanting to be a doctor and told me I’ll “never succeed”,"I’m 22 with a BS + MPH (I did the accelerated program). But according to my mom, my master’s “doesn’t count” because it’s not a “real grad school.” The only thing that counts in her world is medical school.

The thing is — it’s not like law school is some random new idea. I’ve wanted this forever. I literally shadowed a lawyer in eighth grade. She knows this. But since I was young, she’s been brainwashing me to believe that it’s just a phase, that I’d “get over it,” and medicine was the only path. So every choice I’ve made has basically been to keep her happy. And now when I finally have the guts to say, “No, I want law,” she trashes it and makes me feel worthless.

Today was just… classic her. She’s traveling, so I was driving her to the train station. I put on a podcast she was enjoying, and she suddenly goes, “Turn it off, I need to talk about something important.” I already knew where this was going, so I said no, let’s just listen. She ignored me (like always, because she doesn’t respect boundaries at all) and launched into the whole med school vs. law school thing.

Within minutes she was yelling stuff like:
	•	“You’re never going to have a future.”
	•	“In two years all your classmates will graduate and you’ll have done NOTHING.”
	•	“No one’s ever going to want to marry you.”
	•	“You’re throwing your life away.”
	•	“You’ll just end up crying and begging me for money.”

Like… imagine being trapped in a car with someone screaming this at you. I finally snapped and said I wasn’t running errands with her anymore, I was just dropping her at the station because I wasn’t going to be insulted while driving her around. Then of course she flips it. Starts crying. Telling me I “punish her,” that I “don’t respect her,” that I “don’t appreciate her sacrifices.”

And then the gaslighting — “I’m not insulting you, I’m just telling the truth.” According to her, law school is a joke, lawyers make no money, the only respectable career is being a doctor.

Meanwhile I’m sitting here like: I’m 22 with a master’s. I had a law firm interview TODAY. I’ve been applying for jobs all summer (she calls me lazy because I haven’t landed one yet). And she still finds ways to blame me for random crap like “ruining” her conference because we didn’t get the colored labels she wanted on errands.

It’s so suffocating. She’s been forcing medicine on me since I was a kid, and now that I’m finally choosing what I’ve always wanted, she’s tearing me down and trying to make me feel insane for even considering it. And the messed up part is, even though I know a lot of what she says is ridiculous, it gets stuck in my head anyway. When someone drills this stuff into you constantly, it’s impossible to just “tune out.”

I just want to live my own life. I just want to breathe. But I’m stuck here until I can afford to move out, and in the meantime I feel like I’m drowning in her voice telling me I’ll never succeed unless I do exactly what she wants.

1o38gth,Being Gaslit for My Own Accomplishment,"Hello all this is my first time posting on this sub so please forgive me if I'm not doing this right. I'm coming down from a heated discussion with my covert narcissist mother. 

Context: 
I grew up in an enmeshment. Raised by a single mother who I realized was a covert narcissist back in 2022. I am 31 years old and still recovering from a life time of abuse that I didn't even understand until my wedding in 2022.

Now to the issue at hand. I have been implementing boundaries over the last few years to protect myself while maintaining a love you from a distance relationship with my mother. Last week I won a business award. I did not tell my mom about the award until I sent out the links to watch. The only reason I sent it to her is because I also sent it to my God mom and brother and I knew word would get back to her if I didn't.

Anyway during the conference after i won my award my mother was freaking out because she missed it so i eventually had to leave the conference room to send her the replay.

THE REASON I DID NOT ORIGINALLY WANT TO SHARE:

I have been working on this business since 2021 at that time she told me I had no business doing the business because I'm not a parent. When I joined a business school this year to relaunch with some assistance I attempted on many separate occasions to share what I was doing and talk to her about my business which was met with dismissal. I mean if we were engaging in conversation there would be complete silence on her end. If we were in the same room she would completely leave the room. After a while I gave up sharing information because obviously she was not interested.

Back to the award: after she watches the replay she gives me praise because as we all know this is now something she can brag about to friends. I as an introvert needed a full week to recharge after sed 3 day conference so I spend this week resting and isolating from the outside world.

I get a call from her and answer and she asks the question above. After arguing for a good 10 minutes because I refused to be Gaslit about this she kinda made an agree to disagree statement. Shortly thereafter I ended the call. 

I am now in an anxiety spiral trying to calm myself. I'm angry, frustrated, and honestly just hurt. 

It's crazy how now that I've won an award all of a sudden she's so interested and so hurt I never told her about it. 

So here I am again being guilted for living my own life and supposedly excluding her from it when she refused to support me in any meaningful way in this area of my life.

1o37gdt,What would be the best decision to make in this situation?,"\*\*TRIGGER WARNING\*\*: discussions of emotional abuse, suicidal thoughts, grief, depression\*\*

Hello, I am posting this because I am at the end of my tolerance and can't stand my mom anymore. For context, growing up, my mom has always favoured my brother, and my dad was the only person in my family to even defend me against her, which I now recognise as bullying. As someone who grew up with ADHD and got a diagnosos later in life by my own means she constantly continues to say I am lazy and don't put in any effort but then flips to comparing me to political figures (she knows I disagree with) gifting me their books and then guilt tripping me saying she is a horrible mom and she just sees me being as successful as them. Growing up, my brother was like her little assistant, treating me as she did until a year ago when he went to college, got a girlfriend, and was shown that what we experienced from our mother was not ""normal"". I live in a different state from my mother, but a few hours away. My brother lives in the same house as her, but basically lives at his girlfriend's (I feel like I don't need to explain why lol). My dad died around 2 years ago, and my life has been a living hell since then, not even counting my mother. So many other things have happened, including developing a chronic illness and losing many of my best friends due to my grief, changing me, or making them feel awkward.

My bullshit tolerance is so low at this point that I have silenced all notifications from my mom, but I have to remain in contact with her because I am in college, taking 18 hours of classes, volunteering, and working two jobs, but still am financially dependent on her. Still, nothing is enough, and I wish so badly to be in no contact with her as she is ruining my life, but I am keeping it together at the same time. I am so drained and depressed at this point, I am constantly suicidal, and when I told her one time (I was so desperate), she started saying ""we"" aren't that bad. It sounds so silly typing this that I would even think to text her about this, knowing exactly how she would react, or that I am just now, as of a few weeks ago, silencing her messages and calls. The contrast of her niceness one moment and cruelness the next has messed with my head so much. I am in therapy and working on coping, but once a week is not enough, and I can't afford to double my sessions. 

My mom just triggers such intense depression, but I literally can't pay rent without her help. She is threatening me, telling me that she is not going to cosign another apartment for me, forcing me to move back to my home state, where I will have no school, no friends, no job, my brother won't be home often, and it will be mostly just me and her. I always think of her as the energy vampire from *What We Do in the Shadows,* LOL, if any of you have seen that show. I feel like she loves to have power over me to make me break down, and she can take everything away from me instantly.

I am wondering if anyone has been in a similar situation, how they got to no contact, if possible, and how to remain at minimal contact without breaking, because I feel like I always break when I am desperate. I am also wondering, coping strategies you guys use to stay stable (besides medication lol, I am on medication), also, just any and all advice is welcome! But really, mainly looking for coping skills and things relating to my contact with her. I do have a good support system with friends, but I can't break my lease right now, and I am working as many hours as possible with my schedule, so I just ask that you please refrain from any advice pertaining to the financial stuff because I really am doing all I can with that.

“I’m too old and wise to fall into your traps, <my name>.  I don’t believe you.  I have no desire to engage in your anger charged ravings.  I was trying to tell you something.  All the things you bring up are old.  You are still blaming us for your using.  You know the truth.  It didn’t happen and you are responsible for your own actions.”

I’m totally destroyed by this, on so many levels. 

Y’all were right 6y ago: with a true narcissist in the family, the gaslighting will never stop. They’re incapable of self-reflection in any sort of meaningful way. 

The gaslighting and immaturity are somehow shocking and at the same time, totally unsurprising.

For the record: it happened. I was there. Gaslighting hurts.

1o37cca,I'm so tired of not feeling like I exist because of my twin,"Hey, im 16M and I Dont know what else i Could do
I have a Twin brother and we've been together all of our lives and i can't stand him, he's been bullying me since forever but our parents have never done anything about it. We went to the same kindergarted, primary school and now even to the same secondary school because our parents didn't want him to be alone. And im so tired of being around 24/7 (and i mean that literally) because we're always together we share the same friend group and pretty much everything, i dont own anything on my own besides my phone.
It has made a huge impact on me mentally because i dont even have a name, we're only reffered to as ""the Twins"" and I as an individual entity Dont really exist. This year i joined some kind of youth organisation for talented students and i got accepted because they were so flattened by me, but they also accepted my brother because they didn't want to risk me not going because my brother isnt accepted. With this group i went to a trip to romania and for the first time in my life my brother didn't come and it was so fucking good.
I had my own name. I could talk to people without him imterupting i Could have a face to face conversation with someone for the first time other than him. I felt so extramely happy for the first time in forever feeling like I'm existing and not getting constantly bullied. I got contact to 2 new people and I'm thinking about asking one of them out but I'm scared because I know he's gay like me but what if he turn it down and I lose the friendship I had as well. Or if he says yes how am I gonna date him with him being constantly in my ass, or he'll find out that I'm gay and he'll tell our parents who're extramely homophobic. 

Once we got home I tried to speak to them about wanting to ""exist"" separately from him like he doesn't want to attend that organisation anyways let me have it but they're forcing him to come with me because he's pretty much independent, like he doesn't speak the language of the country where we live so he can't do basic stuff without me and I'm so pissed of at this point. I tried speaking to them about this multiple times but they don't listen to me and I feel like keeping him dependent on means more to them than me being happy and finally independent 
What could I do? Tried to read about similar stories and people say to cut them off because of boundries but I can't do that because I'm underage and can't move out nor do anything but I'm so tired of all of this that I don't want to nor can't take it anymore

1o37474,The Privilege of Opening Her Gifts: A Portrait of Childhood Ritual and Anxiety,"​The sound was a soft, insistent creak-and-release, the metronome of her attention.

​I sat on the edge of the quilted bedspread, a square of tissue-wrapped offering heavy in my hands. This moment—the one-on-one gift opening—was a ritual, a special dispensation that felt less like a privilege and more like an interrogation. I was twelve, maybe thirteen.

​Across the room, she was in her green rocking chair, naturally—no wingback, just a straight-backed menace—a small, dark shape leaning forward just enough. A plume of cigarette smoke curled off the tip of her index finger, hanging low and thick around me like a forced, acrid perfume. The smoke from the overflowing ashtray on her nightstand mixed with her perfume, creating a cloying, hot, clinical weight that was Mother's Presence.

​Her hands were folded in her lap, but her eyes, wide and expectant, were fixed on my fingers. They didn’t blink.

​The first rule of a gift from Mother: The ribbon is an event of beauty.
​I didn’t dare rip it. I slid the shear scissors beneath the knot with agonizing slowness, making sure the bow didn’t tear but simply yielded. I then folded the ribbon’s bright, waxy length into a neat pile. To rush was to destroy the “beautifully decorated trash that hid even more of her love for me.” She would light her second cigarette while I worked.

​Next, the paper. I lifted the pink tissue paper, fluffing and folding the sheets just so, praying I could match the specific, perfect way she had done it. My cheeks were already aching in anticipation of the required response.

​I knew the drill: once the object was revealed, I had to immediately pinch my face into the same painful, gleeful surprise that was expected every time. My smile, when it finally came, would have a scary resemblance to the real thing, my jaw tight with manufactured appreciation. The gift itself was already secondary. It never mattered what was inside; it only mattered that she was seen.



It's my birthday this weekend, and was thinking about this.

1o3745s,Living with abusive mom,"I F29 am living with my mother and younger brother until I can afford to move out . My mom has always been emotionally and verbally abusive. She constantly yells, gets in my face, imitates me, threatens to hit me, and never takes accountability for anything. Every argument ends with her screaming that everything is my fault, even when I calmly try to explain my side. She only ever takes my brother’s side no matter what he does.

She’s extremely sexist and still treats me like a child — watches me when I get ready, comments on where I’m going, and expects me to act like a servant in the house because I’m a woman. She uses religion and guilt to control me and justifies my brother’s laziness and disrespect while blaming me for “not being a good daughter.”

My younger brother constantly starts things on purpose — invades my space, tries to sit in the room I sleep in just to get a reaction, takes over anything I try to have for myself, and then plays victim when I react. He’s manipulative and loves control. My mom always enables him and attacks me instead, saying I’m “evil” or “inhumane” for standing up for myself. Apparently mother is upset because of me Lol she’s the one causing all this chaos and she’s the victim? 

I work, pay for most things in the house, and they still ask me for money constantly — even for his laundry. If I refuse, my mom loses it and starts verbally abusing me again. It feels like they both see me as a tool, not a person.

Whenever I try to stay calm, she’ll purposely bring up old fights or say cruel things to trigger me. She never tries to understand my side — she just wants to win, to prove me wrong, or to make me look like the problem.

1o36wqc,My dad(not a U.S. citizen or current resident) got mad when I asked him not to talk about trump for the 1000th time,"I am visiting my parents who live outside the U.S.. I currently reside in the U.S. and have been enjoying the small break from the hellscape that is life in the states right now. My dad is completely ignorant of the situation there rn yet continues to make little comments and digs about things. I’ve asked him so many times in so many ways not to talk about it. It makes me feel angry, devastated, and helpless to think about right now especially as I am abroad. I was really hoping this trip would be a nice mental break from all the stress for a few weeks. Obviously I still see updates about what’s going on on social media and I’m deeply disturbed. I simply don’t want to discuss it with people who don’t understand the severity of the situation. 

Anyway, he brought up trump this evening and I asked him to please not talk about it. He then launched into an attack about how ignoring it won’t make it go away. I explained that I understand that, but as I’m not currently there and he doesn’t ever have to go there again, I don’t see what us discussing it will accomplish. 

The conversation devolved and he continued to flip everything I said around (or just completely ignored it) to make himself the victim to the point where he was saying he doesn’t want me as a daughter and I have no respect. 

Sincerely fuck you to the deepest depths of hell. You ruined my childhood and gave me such bad people pleasing and lack of boundaries that I’m just now starting to unearth fully. I have accepted breadcrumbs in relationships and friendships for years because I thought I had to earn love and attention by pleasing the other person. You only payed attention to me when you could use me to brag to your friends about how amazing YOUR child was, as if you had any real part in raising me. You are an old bitter narcissist who will never understand why no one wants to be around you because it couldn’t possibly be something you’re doing.

1o36rvn,DAE have a negative relationship with comparing of other people?,"This was one of the rather smaller things my mom did (although I still didn't appreciate it much) was that anytime I got into an argument with her, she'd always flip the script and go ""X person got through this and look at him"" or my favorite one she'd always go ""your sister goes through the same thing and she doesn't complain"" she also one time said we have the same genetics so by that metric I shouldn't have any voice. Basically this was a way for her to not really address anything I brought up to her, and a way so that she can avoid her own shortcomings as a mother.

This may not make sense, and it doesn't seem really that bad (and ig it was of the smaller things she did) but idk I feel have a toxic relationship with comparison of other people now because of this.

unfortunately i don’t have anywhere else to live permanently right now so i have to deal with :( but it’s a living hell
I’m 18f, I work at a doggy daycare and do colorguard for my local college, photography as a side gig along with being a regular craft/accessory seller on depop, and my own puppy who comes to work with me that I am in charge of primarily (I promise these things relate to the story LOL)
A lot of my days are very packed!! and admittedly I pack them so I don’t have to be around her as much but still, even if I wasnt, my schedule wouldn’t be much different. She’s a flight attendant meaning a good chunk of her week is spent out of town (AMAZING FOR ME WOOHOO) but as soon as she gets back, all hell breaks loose :( 
My work opens at 6:30AM on weekdays meaning I have to be up about an hour earlier than that and I find my mom constantly keeping me up at night, ESPECIALLY on the nights I have early work or plans. She’ll keep me up till 11,12,1, 2, and just keep going with “oh come down to my room to talk” “come downstairs so we can talk” etc. etc. and then gets extremely upset when I’m tired and want to exit the conversation, calling me rude and mean. Saying i don’t want to hang out with her ever. 
During one incident, she had kept me up till 4am SCREAMING at me, threatening to kick me out right then and there, telling me my friends were brainwashing me, i’m not gay, all the normal usual insults to hurt my feelings. She never apologized, she never does. she just texts the next day during my shift like nothing happened.
Last night, I just broke. She came into my room at midnight after I worked a 9-10 hr shift + some extra things because I’m going on vacay this weekend so I had to get all my errands done, and i’m sleeping. She decided to bring the cat into my room, put her on my bed so she would come mess in my face and then began poking me. Just going under the blanket and poking me over and over again, and I start groaning at her to stop and that i’m tired. and she FLIPS and starts insulting me “everyone works, you aren’t tired, you’re just high” (i was not) and i’m telling her no, i’m groggy, and she starts laughing and poking me again and so i snap and i’m like “Please stop fucking poking me” and then I’m forced to apologize for cussing at her and being mean, and she slams the door without a goodnight, not responding to my “i love you” (which is a normal thing she does when she’s mad at me)

I wasn’t even taught how to apply to a job by them; they looked at me one day and went “go online or go outside and ask who’s hiring”. 

But when it came to actually making applications, resumes, preparing for an interview, phone calls, etc. there was nothing ever rlly offered by them, so it felt very difficult and lonely. 

Nowadays I hop on Indeed and I’m already panicking. Reading the requirements per job makes it worse. To add to all of this, I was extremely sheltered and only allowed to leave the house for academic/religious things. Friend hangouts required a Broadway script of begging/convincing and a miracle.

I’m a hs senior, oh great! Daughter of Asian immigrants, I’m also an Asian immigrant my younger sis isn’t, she’s us born. 

I have very controlling parents. My father was always absent but not in things concerning me. If I had a 8/10 on as assignment, he’d come home in the evening and my mom would tattle tale to him. He gets mad about my clothes, how I behave to my mom, and my academics. 

Clothes wise, they hate it when I spend more than 10 mins on them, they literally yelled at me when I was wearing a jacket over a cute loose sure that fell mid thigh, and cute pants. They yelled at me, I’m back in the same clothes I wore every day. Baggy shirt and jeans. 

Academics. They hate my grade going below a 95%, they yell at me for everything, they only want me to get into good schools. UCLA. BERKLEY. BROWN. You get the idea. 

Behavior wise, I used to have a good temper, I was always calm and a poker face: but if I reacted or even had no reaction to them yelling, they yelled more. An argument is always about every small little thing.

In America, I’m unsafe and can’t move out. In my home country, I’m chained.

1o338i3,Dad has been watching me on the home cameras while they’re away and it’s made me feel really uncomfortable.,"My parents are away at the moment, and I’m staying at their place. Before they left, I asked my dad where the cameras were and whether they record sound. He said yes, they record sound, but they were only out the front and near the front door/living area. I told him I’m not super comfortable with them but mainly just want to know where they are so I can protect my privacy.

About two weeks after they left, my mum texted me:

“Ok yep. It looked like you were speaking to her🤣 Dad said if SO wouldn’t mind could he put the camera back up off the charger next to the TV. It goes up near where sister sits to work in the front room. Thanks 🙏”

That already felt a bit off. Like they were still monitoring things. But I just didn’t respond and tried to shrug it off.

Then tonight, my dad texted me out of the blue saying something like:

“Went for a swim did you? Haha”

I replied:

“How do you know I went for a swim?”

He said he’d seen me on the camera feed. I told him honestly,

“Not gonna lie, that makes me feel very uncomfortable.”

He doubled down and said:

“Why? If I was home I might look out the window! It only shows you opening and closing the gate!”

I responded:

“Because you’re not home, so there’s an insinuation of privacy. So it’s jarring.”

For context: when we discussed the cameras before they went away, he never mentioned there was one by the pool. That’s what makes this so weird. It feels sneaky. I already told them the cameras make me uncomfortable, but it’s like they don’t take that seriously.

I’m 30, not a teenager, and it’s honestly left me feeling violated. I can’t relax knowing they might be watching me in what I thought was a private space. I have also put on weight recently and feel insecure in my body. I don’t want to be looked at.

Am I overreacting? Or is this as invasive as it feels? They act like I’m an alien for wanting space and privacy. I just want to exist and rest in my home without being perceived. 

Edit: I wanted to add. My dad has made comments about my body a lot growing up. When I was eating he would say things like “Careful, I can see your ass growing from here!” Or “you will become the size of a house if you eat that” he would also make comments when I was a teenager about my boobs and there size like “jeez going to knock the boys out with those”.

He's been acknowledging me more and treating me a lot better since he found out. And the awkward thing is I have to pretend I don't know this is solely because he is dreading the day my mom is going to start making him help around the house more. Mind you, this a man who sits on his phone for 18 hours a day and never pays attention to anything I have going on unless he thinks he has a personal stake in it somehow. He contributes by far the least to the housework and even then, wants to act a martyr over it. He sees me as a guest in *his* home even though I've lived here longer than he has and my mom has always been the breadwinner. And he at one point called me a narcissist and disparaged me on the internet while I was at my lowest point - just because it was mildly inconveniencing him. Instead of apologizing, he just brushed it under the rug and pretended it never happened once that narrative was no longer serving him. 

But now it's over. And he must pretend like he's happy for me so he can stay in good graces with my mom, whom he heavily depends on financially.

1o327kw,How to survive them till I move out?,"It feels like I'm stuck. I'd move out right now if I could but everything is complicated when I'm still financially dependent on them. Idk what I'd do with myself. Some people I trust have said I can stay at their house meanwhile, but I'd still like to have some money of my own if I do that till I move out to my own place.

So right now I'm in college. I don't plan on dropping out since a good degree should be able to get me a good job I can support myself with, but even then it's mentally draining to deal with the stress at my parents' house. Even though I try to keep interactions minimal, even if I just walk nearby them they manage to stress me out in some way. Not to say I feel drained just by being in their house and I've been finding it hard to focus on homework, college, and other things I should probably be doing to gain money. I do try spending more time at college if possible, giving an excuse like tutoring and such. But even then it's not that easy to get out of my house. My parents track my location and a lot of the time it's not enough to just tell them I'm going to college - they have to know WHAT I'll be doing there. And yes, even me wanting to spend time at the library during the summer was hard for them to accept. They literally tried to make the argument that ""you'll be going to college in a month - no need to go outside you can stay here meanwhile"". 

Having a social life is hard for me due to it and it's taken me to find people who understand my situation. I honestly don't understand why they seem to be happy with me staying inside their house all the time and then wonder why my energy levels are low. I also wonder sometimes if they genuinely want me to move out as they say, since everytime I do something independently, they get triggered. If anyone can give feedback about why narcississtic parents might do that then that'd be helpful. If I'm honest sometimes it feels like I'm in a toxic relationship cause if I had a partner who tried to control me in these ways I would have already left forever ago.

But yeah, I think I could go on more about my situation but that might be enough. If anyone has any tips on how you survived your parents till you were able to move out I'd really appreciate it.

1o30akr,My mother would occasionally stop speaking to me for several days growing up and not even look at me. Is that normal?,"I did not realize what my mother's routine ""silent treatment"" behavior was growing up. Now that I am out of the fog and all grown up, I see it as perhaps emotional abuse or neglect. I find it totally appalling that any parent would have treated a young child in such a way. 

I recall my mother and I would disagree or at times I would not even know what I did. I would just see my mother's face get red and she would yell at me for something as I would mostly just stand before her wondering why she was so mad. She seemed increasingly more enraged when I did not seem to understand. I could feel pure disdain and contempt for me.   

It always ended with mom stomping off in another room as I just there alone wondering what the &\^%# just happened. She would ALWAYS follow that by not talking to me or even looking at me for several days or weeks. 

It would suddenly go back to normal on some random day when mom would just start talking to me and looking at me again. There was never any explanation. My dad would see this, but he never once came to my rescue. Friends would stop by to visit and mom would be very friendly with them, and none of them ever noticed I was being ignored as I always just sat silently in the corner.  

Could this be a typical display of narcissist behavior?

From a psychological, therapeutic and/or other view point, is there a specific way to define when the line is crossed?  Striking, hitting and throwing this at kids, as forms of physical abuse, are the most obvious ways.  Of course, we know how often it's not that obvious.

1o2xa42,I can’t deal with my partners mother - it is ruining my life.,"Im not even really sure how to type any of this so forgive me if its a bit of a ramble. 

*TW-Suicide, drugs, gambling, animal neglect*

My partners mother has always been quite challenging but the last 6 months has just taken it to a whole different level. 
Some context - My partner is 29m I am 25f we have been together for 5 years. His mother claims to be agoraphobic and I don’t want to flat out say she is lying but I am pretty confident that she is. She claims to have many other disabilities and ailments that are easily proven false which makes anything she says difficult to believe. 

When I first met her she seemed perfectly normal and I did wonder why most of the family took nothing to do with her because I couldn’t see any issues, she seemed kind and bubbly and just really nice until the inconsistencies and lies started to show.

The first thing was when my partner had been hospitalised and was out of it on painkillers. I’d never had a proper conversation with his mum until that point and we would talk for hours just sitting in the hospital room. She told me about her disabilities and how she couldn’t drive etc so I was driving her around for a couple of weeks. Fast forward to my partner getting out of hospital one night I went to pick him up and the family car was gone, I said “oh is your dad away fishing?” and he said no. I said “oh, in the garage?” he said no. I said “well where is the car?” laughing as I was confused. He said “my mums just at her friends”. I was absolutely gobsmacked, asked how she had managed it and told my partner what she had said in the hospital. He said he didn’t know and wasn’t going to speak to her about it as it was “none of his business”. I just thought fair enough as it wasn’t a huge deal and tried to move on. 

Next thing was neglecting her animals - she has a dog de Bordeaux (I don’t know if that’s how you spell it) and two small mixed breeds that look like Staffies but definitely aren’t. The smallest one has something seriously wrong with her mouth, when I tell you it smells like a bin and you can smell it throughout the whole floor of the house the dog is on I’m not joking. She is flat out refusing to take it to the vets, she claims she doesn’t have enough money yet manages to gamble, take drugs and buy so many clothes and shoes you’ve just no idea. The dog is suffering and I can’t understand why she doesn’t seem to care. The second small one has (I’m assuming) back issues as he sometimes starts dragging his legs but she won’t take him either. The large dog doesn’t have any visible health issues but definitely needs walked more. She refused to train the dog so now cannot control it and she couldn’t walk it herself even if she wanted to. The dog gets out in the garden but probably last went on a walk 6m-1y ago and they scream at her if she runs about, jumps up or does absolutely anything that could get the energy out. 

I am autistic and she suddenly also became autistic. She claimed that a doctor had came to the house and diagnosed her a couple of days after she phoned the GP. As some of you may know, this isn’t possible as it has to follow a process. Not only have I been through the process but I am currently doing a degree in psychology and criminology with the aim of becoming a psychologist specialising in disabilities. I didn’t say anything when she told me but did mention it to my partner who said once again that he wasn’t bothered what she said as if he called it out she would cause an argument. Months passed of me having to listen to her say things like “I can’t eat chicken or any meat it’s my autism that stops me”, “I ordered new shoes I’m so autistic”, suddenly stopped being able to wash her hair “due to autism” and just so many more things it was unreal. Eventually, through watching it hurt me, my partner did say something and the story changed to “well they didn’t actually diagnose me they just said I probably am autistic”. This storyline died off for a while and then she came to me about 3 months ago telling me that she had been diagnosed with Aspergers obviously not realising that this was just an outdated term for autism. Honestly I just went along with it as I couldn’t be bothered fighting her on it anymore and just started distancing myself so I didn’t have to be around it. 

She constantly demands things of me, one night I was sitting in my pyjamas around 11:30pm and she had text my partner saying “get her to get to the garage and get me cigarettes” I originally said no but gave in as it was causing an argument between me and my partner because if he had said no she would have started arguing with him about how he doesn’t care about her. She would regularly demand I take her to cash converters (pawn shop) so she could pawn her phone, laptop or whatever. If I said no I’d be the worst person in the world. I’m not in a great financial position so there were times I couldn’t visit my own family as I simply didn’t have enough petrol or money for more after running her everywhere (not short journeys either, whether it’s the garage or the town it’s always between a 45 min and 2 hour round trip). 

She does weird things like invite us over for dinner then when we get there she makes me drive to the shop, buy the ingredients myself and make the dinner for everyone. 
She also claims to be agoraphobic yet can go to the pub, on holiday, concerts, clubs, out for dinner etc but just can’t work. Whenever anyone brings this up she refuses to discuss it other than saying that she “just can’t work” and that she will kill herself if anyone tries to make her. 

She threatens suicide and then pretends to commit suicide quite regularly. One of her friends told her at the beginning of the year that they no longer wanted anything to do with her or the “bitchiness”. She kept saying she was depressed at about 8pm and we offered to go over several times but she started shouting at us telling us not to and that it would make her worse. At about 1am my partner got a text from her saying she was going to kill herself so I drove over breaking all kinds of laws to get there as fast as I could. The paramedics quickly decided she was faking it but took her in anyway. She went as far as to piss herself when they started suggesting she was faking it to try and prove that she wasn’t. They done blood tests at the hospital which she refused to let the family know the results of but we overheard that there was nothing in her system and the paramedic talking about how she was “putting on a good show”. I honestly thought they would section her but they didn’t. 
As soon as she got out of the hospital she was reading her “suicide notes” out loud and belly laughing at them. Told my partner he couldn’t move out anymore as he needed to be there to make sure she didn’t do it again. 

The third last time I seen her, I told her that the dentist had taken £183 more than they should have so I was buggered money wise. She ignored what I said, started talking about herself, then got up and left the room. The shop (3 houses down) shut at 10pm. She waited until 10:11pm to ask my boyfriend to get me to drive to the garage in town to get her cigarettes. I said no. 
The second last time I seen her, I drove my partner over to speak to his sister and we were all in the kitchen. His mum came flying down the stairs and said to my partner “take my phone up to Cashys, now”. He doesn’t drive, so she was actually asking if I’d do it. He said no as he knew I was struggling and she looked me dead in the eyes and shouted “well you’d can all go fuck yourselves then”. 
The last time I seen her my gran had just been taken into hospital so we turned up about an hour late for my partner to babysit his nephew who had been dropped off at my partners mum’s. She came down the stairs shouting about how we’re lazy and if we could try and use our feet then maybe we would be there on time so she didn’t have to “listen to the wain screaming” as it was “doing her fucking head in”. I said “my gran is in the hospital” to which she kept going talking about how this affected her. I said “this isn’t about you” and my god that was the wrong thing to say. It was like something snapped inside her. She started calling me a dirty thing, telling my partner to drag me out of the house and trying to jump over the bannister to hit me screaming “let me at her” and all the rest of it. I said “you don’t have to worry about that, I will not be back” and walked into the kitchen to get my car keys and phone so I could leave, then left. She said I should’ve left immediately (that would’ve taken me around 4 hours on foot and I need my phone and car). She then changed it to saying that I was apparently standing smirking and laughing at her walking around the house refusing to get out. I let her talk about me for weeks and quite frankly couldn’t have cared less as I knew anything she was saying was a pack of lies. My partner lost it with her and said a few home truths which she did not like and decided that it was nothing more than my opinions being spoken by him. I have never been back. My partner went back a few times all of which he was told to get out because she said she was owed an apology from me for “making her that angry”, “smirking at her” and so much more but I done nothing wrong so she was told there would be no apology. For weeks this went on before my partner decided he no longer wanted anything to do with her unless she was willing to admit her behaviour and apologise to both of us. She tried to kill herself again because of this but once again, not a single thing was found in her system. It was solely to get my partner to talk to her again which he did as he went to visit her in hospital and the only thing she spoke about was how I had “smirked and laughed at her” till they argued because he was there and knows I didn’t so he was told to leave. Once she was home he told her once again that I would not be apologising and we expect an apology from her. She sat with this for a few weeks before deciding to admit that the she was lying and writing me an apology letter. 
I accept the apology but I still want nothing to do with her. She asked my partner a few days ago what I’d like for Christmas and he said nothing as it is very apparent that there is no relationship there anymore. She has not ended up in the hospital this time but text everyone last night saying “remember I love you all” and then went to sleep. 

I do not know how to handle this or what to do. 
I’m sorry for the ramble I don’t even know why I’ve really made this post but I just had to get it off my chest. It’s so hard to deal with, if people don’t do and say what she wants she just threatens suicide. I haven’t spoken to or seen her for months and yet it still feels like she has such a hold over everything like telling my partner who wants to go on holiday that she might “wait until everyone’s too far away to help her” etc. AHHHH !!!!",ObjectiveDifficult49,1760092319.0,21,0.96,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o2xa42/i_cant_deal_with_my_partners_mother_it_is_ruining/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o2xa42/i_cant_deal_with_my_partners_mother_it_is_ruining/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o2x2vi,Coping with the fact my GC sibling has been manipulating me all this time,"So me and my siblings grew up with Nparents. We were all close as we faced the trauma together, it was harsh, it was difficult, but we were here for each other.

Lately I've noticed a common thread of my GC sibling making me feel guilty for the choices I make. They're selfish, egocentric and manipulative and they have harmed me in the past. Like genuinely harmed me, violently. When I decided to take some distance from them as a way to process the trauma they put me through, they guilt tripped me by saying ""you're making me feel like I am a monster"". So I apologized, once again, for a healthy boundary I put up and that should've been respected. It has always been like this, they never respected my boundaries and I apologized putting them up in the first place. I have a long list of examples that I keep to remind myself they were abusive too. As the SG, realising this in my almost 30s hurts like hell.

I just went no contact and once again they guilty tripped me. I've had enough. I can't deal with their melodramatic crap anymore. I've started wondering if they might be a N too, but whatever the label, I can't take this anymore. The answer they sent me after I told them I am going no contact permanently is laughable, with all the snark comments and attacks about who I am as a person, questioning my choice as ""not healthy"".",[deleted],1760091616.0,12,1.0,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o2x2vi/coping_with_the_fact_my_gc_sibling_has_been/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o2x2vi/coping_with_the_fact_my_gc_sibling_has_been/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False

1o2vxh6,I feel like I’m suffocating at home,"I’ve been living with my mom’s parents for about four or five years now, ever since I started college. In the beginning, it was fine. It actually felt nice to have family around in a new place. But over time, it’s become mentally exhausting.

My grandpa is bedridden and paralysed. He’s not a bad person, but he’s very paranoid and gets angry easily. If I come home after 8:30 PM, he gets upset. He fights with my grandma, calls my parents, and starts arguing. For him, 8:30 is “too late,” but for most people, that’s when the evening is just starting.

To avoid fights, I stopped going out at night. I thought maybe if I went out in the mornings or afternoons on weekends, it would be better. I’d go for a few hours, just to walk around, shop a little, or eat some street food. No clubs, no drinks, no parties, no drugs — just simple things to feel alive again. But even then, he got angry because I was “out all day.” It didn’t matter what I did, it was never right.

So I started going out even less. Some weeks I wouldn’t step out at all, even though I’m in my early twenties and that’s the time people usually go out, make memories, and explore. For me, it just became easier to stay home and avoid another argument.

When I started working, things got worse. I barely have energy as it is. Sometimes I leave my clothes out or forget something small, and it becomes a big issue. My grandpa yells, my grandma gets upset, my parents get dragged in, and suddenly I’m the problem again.

Sometimes I stay at my friend’s place to avoid the drama, but even that turns into another issue. My grandma lies about where I am to keep the peace, but then she feels guilty about lying. It’s like no matter what I do, someone ends up hurt or angry.

Lately, my uncles, my grandma, and even my parents have started calling me lazy and worthless. They think I’m not doing enough, that I’ve made bad choices, that I should be doing better. But none of them know how much I’ve struggled. They don’t know about the depression, the self-harm, or how hard college was for me. I was just trying to survive and make something of myself.

I’ve been here for them for years, staying home so they wouldn’t be alone. I’ve missed out on so many things people my age normally do. And somehow, I’m still the disappointment.

Today my grandma sent a photo in the family group of some money I forgot to put in my bag, like I’m a careless child. It sounds small, but it broke me. It reminded me that no matter how much I try, I’ll always be “wrong” in their eyes.

I know they’re old and they need someone around. But I’m exhausted. Every day feels heavy. Every argument and every comment makes me want to shrink smaller and smaller.

I just want peace. I just want to breathe without feeling guilty for it.

1o2vt5h,Is it a wonder that we struggle in adulthood with the bad life advice we were given?,"On top of all the gaslighting and sabotaging they give you bad life advice.

And because they are your parents and kids are wired to obey parental authority - you involuntary adapt at least some of it.

Since they are idiots - its idiot advice that makes your life harder.

The ""advice"" of N dad was to be an egoist and look out only for yourself because friends are just a burden that will drag you down.

Well as a result I was a loner with 0 friends and still dont have any today even after I tried.
This has made my life much harder.

Same goes for all their other ""wisdom"". In 8/10 cases it was the exact opposite of what I should have done.

1o2vqry,I finally snapped - but why do I feel so guilty/bad?,"My dad and I have had a difficult relationship ever since my mom died about 15 years ago. I was a teen at that time and moved in with him. (they weren't together and hadn't been since I was a kid, but I lived back and forth between both their houses) He developed a pretty awful substance abuse issue in the years following, and became a different person than he was when I was young. I moved out for college, and I still say one of the best things that ever happened for my relationship with dad was moving out and not living with him.

He's clean now, for a couple years (at least I think he is. He could be hiding it again) but he's still not the dad he was when I was young. He flies off the handle about things, and doesn't listen when I talk. When a coworker is making his life difficult - he comes to me and complains for literal hours, never veering off that topic. Same for when he and my uncle fight. He won't ever take any advice though, and if I say I don't want to hear it, suddenly it's a big deal how ""selfish"" I am and how ""he just won't bother me with any of his problems anymore."" Nevermind the fact that I've been partially financially supporting him this past year when he had some extended time with being laid off from work.

And of course there's never an apology. He just expects things to go back to normal after he throws his fits. He swings back and forth in such dramatics sometimes that it's like Dr. Jekyll - Mr. Hyde.

So last week we went to the movies and had a good time, but on the drive home he accused me of conspiring against him with another family member to keep my niece away from seeing him (my sibling that is her parent is deceased, and I get her sometimes whenever I can to help her guardian out) - all because he asked if he needed to drive us when I took her trick or treating this year and I responded that my husband planned on driving, but he was welcome to ride along. (He said last year that driving around all the running kids made him anxious, and he doesn't see as well at night anymore, so this year I just asked my husband to drive us.)

I asked him when I had ever kept her from him, and he just doubled down about how I just don't want her to be around him and how shitty that was and all sorts of demeaning things. I cried as I drove us the rest of the way home.

When we got to my house, something just finally broke in me - I am so tired of parenting him, and his emotions being my problem to manage as well as him berating me and expressing such a low opinion of me despite all the help I've provided him.

I told him to get out, go home, and don't speak to me. I didn't want to talk to him for a while.

Now - it's only been half a week, so WHY do I feel SO guilty and shitty??? It's so frustrating!

I think a lot of it is only having 1 parent and having experienced so much loss in our family over the years. Part of me wants to sit down and talk it out with him, even though I know there's a solid chance he won't listen and nothing will change. I just don't know what to do.

Here's where it gets messy. My mom found out that I've included Sarah in some wedding planning stuff (she came dress shopping because she has amazing taste and I invited her) and absolutely LOST IT. We're talking screaming phone calls, saying I'm ""betraying"" her, that I'm ""choosing that woman over your own mother,"" that she ""sacrificed everything"" to raise me.

She's now demanding I uninvite Sarah from the wedding entirely. Not just from the family table, she wants her gone completely. She says if Sarah is there, she'll be too ""emotionally devastated"" to enjoy her only daughter's wedding and ""can't be held responsible"" for what she might say or do.

My dad says he'll come alone if needed but I can tell he's hurt. Sarah sent me the sweetest message saying she completely understands and doesn't want to cause family drama. And I just feel so angry?

1o2sy17,mom keeps spamming me with texts,"I live at home (24F) with my mom (55F).
 I’ve had a tough time leaving home due to fears of driving, making a career pivot, and to be completely honest, I took living at home a little bit for granted. I’ll take accountability for my part of all of our fighting, but I just need an outside opinion that isn’t a family member.

In February, I started my first relationship with my boyfriend. I did not like him when we first met 3+ years ago, but we became close friends in the past few years and started having feelings for one another. 

I love him very much, but the day I told my mom, she lost her mind and screamed at me, threw things, and texted me all day from her work while I was at work and told me I was, and I quote, “a fucking loser, a piece of shit, a disappointment, etc.”

My mother is a very emotional person, and when she gets angry, I have to leave the room because it’s draining. 

My mom has told my whole family how much she hates my boyfriend and refuses to meet him despite my attempts to have him come over to properly introduce himself.

My mom finally seemed to calm down over the summer, but today she told me she was “closing the door” on my boyfriend and told me she had a “timeline” of our relationship. 

She has spammed me with texts all day, verbally decimating me as a human, and has been giving me the cold shoulder since I got home from work because my boyfriend came to my work for dinner, and I ran out to peck him on the lips, and my mother compared me to my father, who left us when I was a child after multiple affairs on my mother. 

I’m just so shocked by all of this. I don’t know how to handle her rage. I don’t understand her anger and won’t hear any defense I make for myself or my boyfriend.

She’s become incredibly cruel, and I don’t think breaking up with my boyfriend will fix anything because I won’t ever forgive her for the things she’s done. 

I’m just very confused, hurt, scared, and sad, and all I really want is my mommy to love me again.

I cried and apologized a bunch, told her she could have my pizza, offered to pay for the wasted pizza but she just kept ranting about it until I couldn’t take it anymore and went to my room. That made her mad too.

My dad on the other hand is just emotionally distant. 

Both of them never knew how to deal with me or my emotions, and I was a very emotional kid because I was sexually abused growing up. I’ve suffered from extreme anger, stress, and anxiety my entire life because of it. Their solution was to scream at me or call the police on me whenever I was angry.

I was also spoiled quite a bit. They may not have supported me emotionally, but they have at least helped me with financial things.

When my nparent watches television, they don't use their eyes, they listen until they find something worth, (to them), interrupting a fellow watcher to inquire about what the nparent's eyes chose to not watch.

They claim to be watching, but observing a visual performance has never been about averting your gaze.

In fact, this behavior does trivialize what blind people go through everytime they want to enjoy a movie, if someone interrupts their audio enjoyment, it so much fucking worse for them.

1o2q1hp,How to safely share pregnancy news with my narcissistic family,"I’m newly pregnant with my first baby, and I’m terrified about how my family will react. I grew up in a narcissistic, enmeshed household where boundaries are ignored and control is constant. My parents are emotionally manipulative and guilt-driven, and my sister is volatile, invasive, and deeply competitive with me.

For background: my sister started pursuing a solo pregnancy journey (via donor) shortly after my engagement. She’s repeatedly attached the timing to my milestones—she was “going to be due” at my wedding (she wasn’t pregnant at the time), and when we changed our date, she conveniently shifted her timeline again. She’s made comments like “you better get ready to help” and has basically acted as if I’ll be attending the birth and helping raise her future child, even though I’ve never agreed to any of it.

As far as I know, she isn’t currently pregnant. My husband and I, meanwhile, had always planned to start trying after our wedding, and I’m now expecting. But instead of joy, I feel dread. I know my sister may rage or spiral if she learns I’m pregnant “first.” My parents will likely enable her behavior and blame me for “causing drama.”

I’ve truly never had a moment of peace from my family. They demand access to my life but reject the version of me that’s independent and happy. I finally feel safe with my husband and want to protect this calm.

For anyone who’s been in similar situations:
• How did you handle sharing big news with narcissistic family members?
• Is it reasonable to delay or limit how much you tell them?
• How do you cope with guilt and anxiety when protecting your peace feels like betrayal?

1o2ozll,I finally stood up,"Recently I finally broke and managed to call out and confront them, for what they put me through.
I wasn’t planning to, they randomly got mad at me for mentioning how they used to treat me, they got mad and tried to tell me I was “unkind”, so I broke and finally pointed my finger for once. And frankly, I was rude about it, because I stopped caring, and I don’t feel bad about it. 
I called them out for their abuse, their sexual exploitation of me as a child, their taking advantage of me and abusing because of my disability.

You can guess this person reacting as expected and went on a tangent to paint me as a horror villain to all our shared family. And of course I’m a horrible witch who simply will not recognize everything they have done for me, like duh…
And don’t you know abuse has a statute of limitations? 
Even going so far as telling their children a thousand and one horrible things about me, I’m sure.

But I don’t care. I feel free. Today I even managed to pick up everything of mine that they had. No more strings.

Like I told my family: if I have to stand alone then so be it. 
If I’m the monster then so be it! 
You have no more strings on me!

1o2o2c6,I moved out two years ago,"In about 2023 I made a post (now deleted) in a subreddit (I don't even remember which one, must have been amItheasshole) about how my mother stole my $1000 scholarship and basically went on vacation.

TL;DR I realized my childhood was not normal and I moved in with my biodad. Now I'm in college and doing okay I think

Watch out this post is unedited, messy, unorganized, and a ride. 

The story in short is that I wanted to go to school in Massachusetts, I got accepted, it was super expensive and my housing plan fell flat and I needed to cough up $5000 in two weeks for my dorm. I told my mom and my step-dad that I can't go as I didn't have the money. Mom said the plant tickets were non-refundable and she would use my scholarship money (cash, deposited into our joint bank account but pay me back.) Spoiler alert, she didn't. In fact, she payed it back and used up all the money before I could get to it.

1. She didn't pay for my ticket because I fly free thanks to my bio dad's job benefits
2. As I got older I realized how tf did she not have the money to fly back. 

Anyway I genuinely thought I was in the wrong because I didn't give her ""enough warning."" Everyone in the comments told me I was basically in an abusive situation and I even got multiple DMs from people giving me their college plans. I was so embarrassed at the attention I deleted the post, but not before it was re-posted to r/twohottakes.  Afterall, I thought I was in the wrong. 

But It's been two years now. So what happened?

I got in a bit of an argument with my stepdaughter over my college savings. I had maybe $600 to my name and my school was $50,000 a semester. The think was, he was the one who encouraged me to try and go, even though I had no idea how to get the funds. When I got rejected for a private loan (blessing in disguise) my mom looked for payday loans...yeah enough was enough. I ""gave"" up on that school (that's how they saw it at first.)

That argument made me think about my childhood. How my mom rarely kept my school lunch account out of the negatives despite having designer bags. How I payed for my lunch account and part of my school fees when I got a job in high-school. How many eye appoints and dental appointments were delayed due to ""money."" How asking for food annoyed her every time. Even when I had my own money she would try to control ot ""comment"" on the purchases I would make for myself. I don't blame her for not being great with money, her role model (grandma) is so much worse. But goddamn it I got a tooth infection from delaying the dentist for 4 years!

Yeah now I'm 19 and enough was enough. Remember the brief mention of my biodad? He wasn't fully aware of everything in situation as my mom told me not to tell him ""our business."" I told him if I could move in with him and he welcomed me with open arms. He flew down, we crammed in my little sedan and drow 3 states away, all 13 hours with whatever I could shove in my backseat and trunk. 

My dad told me that while he was on his way, my mother tried to sabotage me, calling me a problem child and that I was attention-seeking and that I'll be difficult to live with as well about my trip to the mental hospital. Behind my back. Dad said it took a lot out of him not to curse her out. 

It's been almost two years now and I'll be 21 soon. I'm on my second year of college, I have a shitty job but it pays my car and tuition, and I'm going to therapy! I made new friends, I have a 3.7 GPA, and I went to a low-cost university. 

I still talk to my mom, not often. It's very surface level interaction. I want to talk to her and stepdad about what the hell happened in my childhood, but I know for a fact she'll brush it off. And I'm still coming to terms with my childhood wasn't normal and I've barely scratched the surface in this post. It's weird seeing her so nice to me, I know it's a trap. Thank god I have my dad.

The formatting and pacing of this post sucks and I tried to not make it a giant wall of text. If you have any questions AMA I left out a lot, too much for one post.

1o2o0fl,Help me decide whether I should work to have a relationship with my mother,"This might be a little long, but looking for some advise from some fellow victims of a narcissistic mother. 

I went no contact with my mother about 2 years ago. I recently decided that maybe enough time had past that we could try to work things out. I sent my mom a letter laying out all of the problems and issues I've had. (Going back to when I was a child, up until my wedding day 2 years ago. I'm now 28). My letter was about 7 pages and pretty straight forward. A very small portion of that letter was to her husband who also has said and done some manipulating himself. I made sure that there was no cussing in my letter, no snide remarks or digs at either one of them. 

The letters I got back from them were pretty much immediate defense of their actions. Almost as if the reason they acted the way they did is because I did such and such. There was no acknowledgement or understanding on their end of the things that I had problems with. There was minimal cussing in their letter to me, but an immense amount of mocking. By mocking I mean they re-used some of my sentences and using quotations in a snide way. 

I told myself I'd try with one more letter to them both and if theres still no recognition of the hurts they've caused, then I'm just going to give up. 

It hurts so bad to know that my mother has put in more effort to have a relationship with her step daughters than her actual daughter.

1o2mukv,My mom is a mental case,"I don’t understand why my mom constantly says I don’t do anything in the house when I’m mostly the only one trying keep the house clean and cook when she’s too lazy to do it!! Then my dad justifying her laziness saying “oh she tired from work”, all she does is sit at a desk answering phone calls. 

I understand I’m home and can help, which I don’t mind at all, it’s the constant belittling and being treated like I’m some maid that can do every single fucking thing she wants me to do. 

To top it all off, she gets pissed when I don’t do anything the way she wants it done. How am I supposed to know how she wants something done a certain way?? I can’t read her mind.
Especially when it comes to food, she bitches and makes a whole show about it. 

Anything I do is never good enough for her and it’s always what I didn’t do. Always mentioning the fact that I never went to college and that I’m a failure, when I didn’t go because I wanted to work on my mental health. I specifically told them both why I didn’t want to go just yet but it seems she doesn’t give a shit about my wellbeing and only what I accomplished and didn’t accomplished in life. 

The shit is I had applied to an online college so I don’t have to worry about anyone having to take me. I asked her to help me with the financial aid and she told me she needed to get a copy of how much she makes, she never did shit so now I lost my chance for this school year. She even told me would take me to a tech school for veterinary training but she never took me to the orientation. On the same day of the orientation she said she was too tired to drive over there. I don’t fucking know what the fuck she wants me to do when every time I try to do something she makes excuses. 

I’m so done with the bullshit, then she has the nerve to write in my birthday card about how she appreciates what I do when it never feels like she does.

1o2m3ml,Continued frustration with my mother,"I (29F) don’t have a great relationship with my mother (64F). I tried therapy with her (that was a disaster), I’ve tried going NC for a while (she sent my aunts to bug me until I started talking to her again), I try to grey rock but I end up feeling guilty for not telling her things because she gets upset when she doesn’t know….I just feel like I’m losing my mind. 

Latest incident. Last month she announced that she was going to stop paying for Disney+ because she didn’t want to support the company. Fair enough, but I’m also using that account and Disney movies and shows are a safe space for me. So I asked her to transfer the account over to me since she didn’t want to support them but I still wanted to watch, and I’d pay for the account. She was like well I can just transfer it later, that’s a lot of things to do that I don’t want to figure out, I don’t want to do that right now. So I let it be for a few weeks and then just asked again today, offering to help her since she had seemed overwhelmed by the process (not super tech savvy). She asked why I *had* to do it now, she’ll just transfer the account when the payment for the year is up early next year. I said we could just transfer it now so she doesn’t have to worry about it later, and besides that, she had already said she didn’t want to support them anymore. She got defensive, and over the course of a phone conversation she essentially told me that she’s making her own decisions and I should honor them “because what I say is my final word”, it’s her account so she can do what she wants with it, I’m “manipulating her” into changing her mind “but it’s not gonna work on me”…and she also asked what my “agenda” was for transferring it to myself??

*Context: My dad when he was alive (died last year) set up this account for me to use like 4 years ago because an ex blocked me from the account that he created for me as a gift when we broke up instead of giving it to me like he said he would. I was hurt of course and my dad said that there wasn’t a need to worry about anyone else doing that, they’d pay for it so I could always watch without anyone holding it over me…*

So yeah. I saved the places on all my shows and my current partner made me a profile on his account. I deleted my profile off of “her account”. 

It’s not even about the Disney account, I’m just exhausted. Im tired of being called “manipulative” or “a liar” when I’m simply disagreeing with her or suggesting some sort of alternative to her plans. I’m tired of trying to involve her in my life when she keeps pushing me away. She aggravates me so much and it’s consuming my brain space so often. I’m angry way too often. But I also feel like my actions in response to her are nuclear in comparison to what she’s doing, like maybe I am being manipulative or vicious. I can’t seem to get that thought out of my head either so I just…feel awful.

They would physically, verbally and emotionally abuse me, I don't tell anyone this in my life because when people say that their parents treat them horribly people just blindly defend their parents and they don't even know them. 

And on top of that I got constantly bullied and yes my parents did little to nothing to help. My parents wanted me to be this high achieving student but constantly disrespected me and made me feel like I didn't even matter. 

Everytime I look at my parents they actually fill me is disgust and anger. How the hell are these people my parents, I honestly wish I had reality warping powers and turned them into the parents I need, but instead I end up with this garbage.

I’m starting to make some money and my girlfriend (23) wants to go out of country together for Christmas which we are paying half half. My mom and older sister hates this because they think I only care about my gf and don’t care about the family cuz I never mentioned paying for a trip for the family going outside the country. I went some where earlier this year with my family already which I paid for.

My gf also doesn’t like my mom because of how my mom keeps treating her.

I now try to set boundries telling her that things like my decision to go out of country is my decision and that I am also using my own money. She would often start crying and talk about how our family has so many financial issues and I never even think about helping, which I have already helped in the past.

Any time I’d ask her to prepare me some food she goes “I’m not ur chef.” If i made a mess she goes “I’m not ur maid”I agree,ur not my chef. But I don’t know, shouldn’t you cook for your 12 year old ? Or atleast have a job and bringing in income if u don’t cook or clean? She constantly talks about. She hates poverty and doesn’t want to be on welfare anymore and wants a car, but she’s been offered jobs and refuses them because she doesn’t want to work for someone else, she wants to be a business owner. Keep in mind we moved from New Mexico to Oregon in 2015 for her to start this business, it completely failed and I ended up going back with my brother to my grandmas house. Not that we should use failed a business against someone, but… she says that the reason she hasn’t been able to find a job for five years and hasn’t made any income is literally not her fault at all she says it’s all Covid‘s fault and everyone’s poor and struggling right now, but we have Ben in poverty for 5 years so? I did not want to call her lazy to her face because I love my mother so much And I don’t like to say stuff like that to her face. But when you’re constantly talking about how you wanna be out of poverty, you need to be putting some action in it too. I remember when I was 10 years old she would you tell me these stories, about how We’re gonna become rich and famous. I went around the school telling people that I was gonna be famous and rich. It was actually so embarrassing to look back. And I mean this in the kindest way possible what are you gonna get famous off of you? You’re not trying to get famous. So how?",ibyuiii,1760045448.0,7,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o2ij1s/am_i_wrong_for_calling_my_mom_lazy_to_her_face/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o2ij1s/am_i_wrong_for_calling_my_mom_lazy_to_her_face/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o2iirb,Just spent the last hour being screamed at....,"Apparently my nfather is having financial issues, and it's all my fault. 

For some context, we rent a three bedroom house. There's his bedroom, my bedroom, and a spare room that he wants to save for when his two other children come to stay (which will NEVER HAPPEN, as he's completely lost custody of them.) The rent here is expensive; we live in a hcol area. He has his own business, but I guess it's not doing very well right now..

Anyways, I guess he's late on rent. We haven't been talking really at all lately, because I got tired of being berated and chastised every time we interacted; until today, when he wanted to bring up the rent. He also wanted to tear me apart while he was at it.

According to him, all of the negative things that my partner did while they were staying here were my fault, that I KNEW they were extremely mentally sick and were going to cause issues, that I am a manipulator, disgusting for crying (but also pretending to cry?), all the bills he has to pay are my fault, I make everyone uncomfortable when they come over (no one comes here), and a bunch of other very mean and untrue things. 

I was very afraid that he was going to hit me while I was standing there being yelled at. He was shirtless, had his shirt draped over his shoulder, and kept whipping it my direction. I need to fucking leave. I NEED to get out of here. I am so scared all the time. I've been working very hard to get a full time job so I can rent a room somewhere in this city, but I've only been able to find part time work.

After the hour long chastising, I am so fucking tired and worn out. All I want to do is lay down and take a nap,  but I'm scared he's going to knock on my door and tear me apart/scream at me again. I hate my life and want to die. I just want things to go back to normal and to have independence again.",420doghugz,1760045429.0,8,0.84,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o2iirb/just_spent_the_last_hour_being_screamed_at/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o2iirb/just_spent_the_last_hour_being_screamed_at/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o2hxf9,I'm so done with my mom and need to know if others relate.,"Hi everyone (\^\_\^)/, I (21M) am in nursing school and at my absolute breaking point with my mom's behavior. I journal to process my thoughts, but I'm constantly angry, feel completely trapped, and I'm trying to figure out if this is emotional neglect, narcissistic parenting, or both. I'm in therapy, mostly to deal with a past relationship, but my therapist knows about my mom and calls her very controlling, which feels so true. Sorry, it's a long post, I didn't know what tags to put because I am also looking for advice. There's a lot to unpack, and I'd love to hear if anyone else has dealt with this kind of kind and have any stories/advice on this, it would mean the world.

My mom has always been controlling, but it's gotten worse since I turned 21, which makes no sense. Shouldn't I have more freedom now? She gets mad over the most trivial things, like me waking up at 10-11 AM on a rare day off. When she does get mad at me, she acts like I'm a total failure. Growing up, she used to hit me with her fists, and while that's stopped, the emotional manipulation hasn't. She lies, twists things to make me feel guilty, and makes me feel like I can't do anything right. She's also super controlling about my life choices. When I was dating my ex of 4 years, she tried to stop me and acted like she decided who I should date. I had to keep my relationship a secret because I loved her, but whenever I did ask why she was so controlling, she'd dodge the question, she wouldn't tell me anything. Even worse, I didn't even want to be a nurse. I've always wanted to go into the law field, but she forced me onto this path, completely ignoring my dreams. In public, when she's angry at me, she flips a switch and acts like the sweetest, most caring mom to me and everyone else to maintain her image. Yet she'll also talk badly about me to her friends, acting like I can't hear her, which makes me feel so small and humiliated. It's such a fake act, and it makes me feel like I'm going crazy because no one sees how she really treats me at home.

The favoritism is so blatant it's painful. I'm the youngest, and my oldest brother is her golden child. She does everything for him, cook his meals, cleans up after him, you name it. He can do no wrong, even when he's messed up big time, like he totaled his car and 0 consequences, no lectures, nothing, he's even getting a new car. But if I so much as backtalk even a little, I get scolded and the silent treatment for at least a week. It's like there's a different set of rules for me versus him, and it makes me feel worthless. When she's angry (which is basically always), she'll even stop feeding me, like withholding food is some kind of punishment. It's exhausting, and to make things worse, my brother is starting to act just like her, getting mad at me over small stuff, being immature, and not letting me make my own decisions, just like she does. It feels like her toxic behavior is rubbing off on him, and now I'm dealing with both of them.

The financial stuff is another huge issue; she takes my money from my paychecks and puts it into her own bank account, saying she's ""saving it for my school,"" but it's looking like she doesn't even use it. Why can't I see it or have access? I'm in nursing school now, so that money should be going toward my tuition, as that's what I was expecting from MY money. Instead, she says she expects me to pay her back for everything once I'm done, like, all the stuff she supposedly covered with my money. The math doesn't add up, and it feels like she's using my money for her own things and planning to make me repay her for it. A big example: when we went to Korea in December, she took $5,000 from me, saying she'd hold onto it, but she never paid me back, I never even got to see my money. I was going to use that money to shop and enjoy my time there, but it's just gone, and she acts like it's no big deal. Even with the little money I do have left, she gets mad if I spend it on things I want; yes, she monitors my card. I am on a joint account, but anyway, she gets mad at me for spending it on games, clothes, figurines (my main hobby), or even food and drinks. It's like I'm not even allowed to enjoy anything. A couple of months ago, I was seriously thinking about moving out and leaving all this behind, but I can't. I don't have the money, especially since she's taken so much of what I've earned.

She also gives me no free time. My schedule is a nightmare; I'm in school 4 days a week, working 4 days a week, and hitting the gym 5 days a week to stay sane after her body-shaming. I'm lucky she doesn't know what location tracking apps are, because if she did, I genuinely feel like I'd be living in prison. There's barely any time left, and I've told her I need time to study, but she doesn't get it. She piles on more expectations or guilt-trips me for not doing enough around the house. She even gives me a curfew of 10 - 12 PM, which is ridiculous. I'm 21, why do I need a curfew? When I was younger, I didn't have one, and I had to resort to sneaking out just to have some freedom. She also bans me from using my computer overnight, like I'm a kid who can't be trusted. It's gotten so bad that I've resorted to cheating on tests just to keep up, which I hate, but I feel like I have no choice with how little time I have. It's like she doesn't care about my goals or how hard I'm trying to make it through school. She just wants control over every second of my life.

It's not just me; she neglects my dad, too. My dad is getting old, works long hours at a factory, and comes home exhausted every day. She's a stay-at-home wife but barely cooks or does much around the house, and when she does, she expects me and my dad to help her, like it's our job to pick up her slack. I had to fight back the urge to ask her, ""Is this why you're not working?"" but I stopped myself because I knew it'd start a fight. My dad recently asked her about retiring, and she shut him down, saying ""no way,"" even though he's clearly worn out. I love my dad. What kind of sense does that make? It's like she's controlling his life, too, and doesn't care how he's struggling. It makes me so angry to see him treated like that.

It's gotten so bad because I feel like I have no one to turn to. My middle brother used to be there for me, he'd talk to me about my emotions, he'd stand up for me and he let me cry when I needed to, but now he's not around as much. I also lost my girlfriend, and all my friends have moved away to dorm at school, and even when I do get to see them I feel out of the loop now. I'm stuck in this house with no support system, dealing with my mom and my oldest brother ganging up on me. Therapy helps a bit, but it's mostly focused on my breakup, and I'm just starting to dig into this stuff with my mom. I'm so done with it all that I know for sure, when I finally get the chance to move out, I'm going to ghost my family. They won't hear from me again. I just can't deal with this toxicity. I'm so angry and exhausted, and I feel like I've lost any sense of control over my own life. I'm starting to wonder if this is emotional neglect or narcissistic parenting. Has anyone else dealt with a parent like this? How do you tell the difference? And how do you cope when you're still stuck living with them? I'm trying to figure out how to protect myself.",jaem77n,1760044009.0,4,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o2hxf9/im_so_done_with_my_mom_and_need_to_know_if_others/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o2hxf9/im_so_done_with_my_mom_and_need_to_know_if_others/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o2hiie,I can't stand the way my mother treats me.,"(This is something I wish I could tell to her. It describes what I daily go through)

Hi mum, why don’t you like me? It’s a question I’ve been asking myself lots of times. I understand I’m not the perfect daughter, nor the smartest one, or the prettiest one, or the most helpful one. But you’re supposed to love me no matter what, …right? I know that also requires me to show you respect and love, but it’s extremely challenging, considering the way you treat me.

I wish you could just get in my place and see the world as I do. So you would notice how much your words and actions hurt me and affect my mental health. If you loved me more, I’d now be a confident person with a better attitude. But kids are like sponges, they absorb everything they see — behavior, words, and actions. And thanks to that, I now find myself mentally exhausted, hating myself and feeling overwhelmed. I seriously need to know what have I ever done to deserve this, because living this way aches my heart more and more.

I hate the way you live in a constant state of victimization, trying to make me feel guilty for any little thing. You get mad at me for supposedly “doing nothing”, when all I’m trying is to keep you happy. You think I like the moment you get home just to criticize my work (as chores or homework) and not appreciate my efforts? Thats what hurts me the most. Because even when I’m tired, starving, busy or stressed…I help you. Always. I always do that, and you pretend not to see it.

And if you compare the way you treat me, to how you treat my younger sister, you’d realize what I mean when I say you clearly love her much more. At this point, please, just let me leave home.

1o2dxgx,Am i just the crazy one?,"Trigger warning: Descriptions of abuse, mentions of self-harm and suicide

18M looking for advice

I've been living with a narc mother (at least I suspect her to be) all my life, and now that I'm 18, I am finally able to move out, but I can't seem to pull the trigger. 

I have a friend that lives in a single family house, and he has a spare room that I could rent (i have an income and savings from freelance video editing over the internet) 

But I'm having doubts. Doubts about whether I'm overreacting. Because the abuse (it feels weird to describe it this way) isn't daily, and im very put off by the ""good days"" she has

And what I experienced from her (and my father) is:

- Being screamed at and called a ""fucking weirdo"" by my mom when I left our dining area to eat in my room after she put the music on Max volume
- I got kicked by my dad because he didn't like the way I walked to do something I was asked to do
- Got told that I ""Have emotion management problems"" after my only self-harm occurence (She had a few days of saying shit things about me and everyone)
- Got screamed at even though I broke down crying (even when I was like 11)
- My mother destroyed my tablet because she was mad 
- Im afraid to wear clothes that she doesn't like (cause she thinks they're too cold) and that she'll make a fight about it
- And honestly so much more...

Like I know how fucking stupid this sounds and even may come off as karma farming. But that's what my mind says, when she's having a few good days, and when i hear how they supposedly ""love me"". It makes me feel like I'm overreacting 

Another reason I am doubting my decision is because I can be almost certain that once I move out she'll likely try to commit suicide, self harm, and if not that, she won't continue her cancer treatment.

1o2dohd,Now realizing the effects of being constantly invalidated…makes me come across as a poor communicator in the career field (“rambling”),"So being raised by narcissists = narcissism is normalized, so you end up with a bunch of narcissists that you hang out & interact with socially, that a normal person would’ve known to just cut off. 

The ramifications of that… I now realize I am considered a “poor communicator”, because I overexplain things, for example in a job interview setting. 

And it’s because I’m so used to never receiving appropriate validation/ & being so often invalidated, that I spend so much time & energy reiterating even the simplest point because my mind preemptively assumes the other person will act like they don’t get it. 

Because a narcissist will act like they don’t get it when you say something simple, just because your statement may have unintentionally called them out [narcs always feel called out when you say something moral/correct] or/& because they don’t want to give you credit for making a good point, because they don’t like acknowledging someone else’s smarts. 

Due to the narcs I got used to engaging with, I got so used to having to explain  1 + 1 =2 a million ways, breaking it down to the barebones, just for a narc to sit there and gaslight & invalidate you, because they refuse to give you credit for being correct. Now I realize this is how I learned to speak in general, never succinct, and it probably comes across as Condescending to a normal person who doesn’t understand why I’m breaking 1 + 1 into minute steps. 

For example, there’s ‘some’ on Reddit that does the same thing👀it doesn’t matter the facts you give, the evidence you present, the sources you cite, the sound reasoning, & how it’s common sense + factual knowledge, if they feel called out, they will downvote the comment stating “1+1=2” just to invalidate you. It’s really sad actually 

Also… the narcissistic school system that trained us to be this way …. You were told to write a paper of 15 pages something that could’ve been communicated in two, remember that? Using a bunch of fillers & double paragraph formal to stretch out a paper…. Now just to realize in adult real life, people are far more interested in reading the 2 pages than the 15. But I’ve already conditioned myself to give the long answers and I’m seriously having trouble with the former. 

Even a lawyer friend of mine said all they do is “skim”-documentation, it’s rare someone’s going to be the type to sit and actually read your 100 page paper unless they are the super academic type.

I guess it’s just so hard when these narc people hide behind masks of virtue signaling but don’t live up to it once called out. And see, I probably even did it here😭

1o2ciua,My nmother is dying and I'm struggling.,"I have been no contact with my nmother for over six years now, but I still talk to my dad, who is still with her. 

A few weeks ago Dad called me to let me know that he'd had to take my mother to the hospital for chest pains, thinking it was a heart attack.

Turns out it wasn't a heart attack, but she has a bunch of blood clots, and while they were doing imaging they also found a large mass on her liver and a small one on her breast. The biopsies show that it's cancer, it started in the liver and it metastatised.

She already wasn't in great health, but... yeah. Dad said that if I ""ever want to speak to her again"" he ""doesn't think there's much time left"".

I thought about it, and I really don't want to speak to her. The only things I would want from her are honest answers and a genuine apology, and I know I won't get either. She's a pathological liar and a narcissist. 

The only other thing I would want would be to go on a tirade at her about all the things she did to hurt me, all the abuse she put me through and all the times she let others hurt me so that she could ""save"" me from them. 

But honestly, there really isn't much point to it. It might feel good in the moment, but it would give her all the ammunition she could want to ruin my relationships with my family on her way out. She'll do whatever she can to make herself the victim.

So, I'm not going to speak to her. I'm not going to go see her before she dies. 

But that means I won't be going to see my dad before she dies either, and I want to be there for him. 

And... I don't want to go to her funeral. I don't. It will be a Christian service full of people all saying what a wonderful woman she was, and I can't stomach that. I don't think I'll be able to sit through it, knowing the kind of person she really was,  without blowing up at someone. 

Having to stand there and politely thank people as they tell me they're so sorry, she was so kind, she was such a good person, such a strong woman of God, when I know the truth. 

When I know that she loved to tell stories of me being injured or traumatized as a toddler.

That she convinced me that it was my fault our dog was run over when I was 8.

That she'd medically neglect me so that I'd get sick enough that I needed to go to the hospital. 

That she neglected our pets.

That she tried to force an eating disorder on me. 

That she would call my intellectually disabled brother the R word. 

That she constantly blamed me for being sexually harassed,  even by grown men, even when I was *ten years old*.

That she spent years trying to keep me from being able to take a shower, and would scream at me when I managed to take one anyway. 

That when I was 14, she screamed at me for hours and told me I was ""going to get raped"" because I wore black eyeliner. 

That she forced me to have an unnecessary lumbar puncture.

That she convinced my dad he didn't have the right to have a say in my and my brother's medical treatments, so that he wouldn't see the medical neglect and abuse she put me through. 

That she made me suffer for six years with undiagnosed endometriosis, because she wouldn't let me go see a gynecologist. 

That even when I got a diagnosis at 18, she tried to take the meds he prescribed me away, because she didn't want me on birth control. 

That she allowed me to be groomed and molested by the man she cheated on my dad with. She *knew* it was happening, she was *there*, and she fucking *let it happen* because she saw his interest in me as a compliment for her. I was *eight*.

When I know that she was a fucking monster behind closed doors.

And I know that very few people will believe me. 

Hell, even my dad doesn't entirely believe me about the parts I've told him about (and there's a great deal I never told him). Between the gaslighting and the cognitive dissonance and him growing up with a malignant narcissist mother, and her ability to leave herself room for plausible deniability, and to get her version of the story out before I tell mine... yeah.

I don't think I'll grieve her when she's gone. I already grieved when I went no contact. I grieved her, and the mother I thought I had, and the mother I wish I had, the mother I *should* have had. I don't think there's much grieving left for me to do. 

It's everything else I'm worried about.

1o2bz94,Beware of tragedies and narcissism,"Beware 

If you engage with a narcissist, beware of what you tell them, because they’ll use anything and everything against you. If they feel they’re losing control of you, if they can’t access emotions like they used to, if they can’t manage how you see them like they once did, the more desperate they become, the more dangerous the game will turn. 

I trusted my n mom, telling her a few more boundaries I expect myself to follow, as well as her, and if not then I’ll end the conversation. Now, she’s made her own boundaries and won’t help me financially unless I talk to her on the phone first. At first glance this may seem fair or innocent, but in reality, she’s bribing me to engage with her. She wants me to need her, to come running back into her arms the moment I renounce my independence, realize the error in my ways, tell her how badly I’ve treated her for refusing to engage with her slander and gossip, I’ve hurt her by telling her the truth of my experience, that she’s right, my two therapists are wrong and they have turned me against her and everything my mom’s said about how hateful and cruel others are is right, how could I be so blind!? And on and on and on…

My mom’s never had boundaries, I don’t understand how she’s ok with literally bribing me into calling her when I don’t want to, and IF I do it’s only for help with money. That’s not normal, right? 

My 23 year old first pet bird died a week ago and I’m grieving his loss, and I have been grieving the loss of my last job, losing my little sister and our relationship (she’s estranged along with the rest of my family), losing my brother and his family, my dad, my previous three jobs, my ability to drive, my last long term relationship, and so much more, for the past five years. 
But of course, my mom needs me to need her, nothing will ever be important enough for her to put me first, for her to care enough about me to not make a tragedy into her own personal benefit.

I needed a place to vent so thanks for reading, if you made it this far. I’m looking for any thoughts or advice if you have any.

She also sees everyone as a bad or inferior person and she always acts like she's the most important person in the room.

1o2acp0,How do you go NC when you know your mum loves you deeply but can’t love you properly?,"(M30s) My mum has always made sure I’m physically safe, supported me financially, and clearly loves me. There’s no doubt that she would move mountains for me. But, she’s definitely got bad narcissistic traits. Growing up I never knew what mood she would be in. She would blank me for days for no reason and not tell me why. She’s would scream really horrible things in my ear shot like “my dad had murdered her baby” (she had an abortion). When I was 10 years old i remember verbatim she said to me “I’ve put up with your sh*t for 10 years and your dads sh*t for 15 years”.

As I’ve gotten older I’ve realised that I can’t talk about my emotions to her without her either not caring or making it about her. She will clean my flat when I’m depressed or pay for my therapy, but she won’t hear me. She almost gets annoyed when I talk about it. When I got diagnosed with PTSD after a car crash, she said “oh ok” in a flat tone and changed the subject. She indirectly told me that I ruined her life my being born the other day, without using those exact words, and in response i said “well you should have had an abortion then”. I regret saying that, but I was just pushed and pushed and pushed and i didn’t care anymore about hurting her feelings. She never apologises. When I try to express how her behaviour hurts me, she turns it around and makes herself the victim and I end up feeling guilty. But she’s so smart in how she does it and I don’t even realise until the next day that she turned a conversation about my feelings into her feelings and how awful I am. I have felt guilty every day for over 30 years. That isn’t normal. That isn’t how a mother should make you feel. 

I finally told her everything I felt. That she’s a narcissist and can’t handle criticism. Now I’m drowning in guilt. I feel like whatever I do talk to her, go no contact, set boundaries, stand up to her… I end up in pain. 

I really feel like there’s no way out sometimes.

I posted about this yesterday and a lot of people told me to go no contact or low contact, but I just can’t see how I can do either of them. No contact is unbearable guilt and low contact is her saying I don’t love her all the time.

1o29z6a,Going nuts from family drama,"When I was about 9-10 years old, my father molested me when he was drunk on two occasions in one night. I told my mother about it the next morning, and she did nothing. This gnawed at me until I was 17, and I snapped. I contacted child protective services. I was separated from my parents and placed in an institution for a week, then sent to BUP (Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Services). BUP wanted to send me back home and contacted my parents. My parents lied to BUP, saying that we had ""processed this as a family and talked about it many times afterward,"" which was a lie. I was sent back home with my parents the same day. Fast forward to when I was about 22, I just couldn’t handle having a relationship with my father anymore, both because of this abuse and because he is thoroughly rotten and sick in the head. I cut contact with both my parents. Family drama ensued. My aunt pressured me to reconnect with my mother. I did, and we had a relationship until recently. Seven years later, my mother called me to say there was something she ""needed to get off her chest."" I thought maybe she had realized that my father didn’t treat her or me well and wanted to apologize for not taking action when I told her about the abuse. But no, it was about her asking if my grandfather had ""manipulated me into cutting contact with them."" I lost it with her, and she denied that anything had happened to me. After a lot of back-and-forth, she finally admitted that the sexual abuse happened, but by then I felt it was far too late. So I cut contact with her again. Now a whole family drama circus has started again. My aunt called me and tried to get me to talk to my mother. She informed me that my great-aunt wants to arrange a meeting with me and my parents so we can ""resolve the conflict."" (My great-aunt (on my mother’s side) has previously tried to pressure me to reconnect with my father because I apparently need to ""forgive him for the sexual abuse for my mother’s sake,"" or I’ll regret it when I’m older.) I also found out in this conversation that this is all about some inheritance? Which I think is absolutely insane. (The inheritance issue is too long a story to go into.) Now my great-aunt is constantly calling me to try to arrange this meeting.

I don’t understand what there is to discuss? A parent sexually abused their own child, and I’m expected to just roll over and resolve it? Why doesn’t it make sense to my family that I’ve cut contact with my parents? I feel like I’m going completely insane. What do I do in this situation? Should I move abroad?

1o29j5f,I feel awful for ignoring my Nmom’s texts after recognizing her abusive tactics,"Hello, I’m 18f, I recently went to college in my state about 2 months ago now. For context my mom has previously emotionally abused me due to me being queer (it’s very hard for me to use the word abuse as she gaslit me into thinking she was just looking out for me, just wanted to add I’m just scared to use that phrasing) she’s used very weird tactics on me growing up before I came out to her, like threatening to or even sending videos of me crying or having a breakdown while laughing at me to my family members as a form of punishment or to make me “see how stupid I look. She’s been using triangulation to make me dislike my dad who I favor more even though he is not a good person in the grand scheme of things. She’s guilt tripped me several times, FaceTimes me just to do so. Recently I went to my dad’s for the weekend (I live 40 minutes away from my house from campus) and I texted her before hand saying maybe I’d see her. I ended up having to come back on campus early or else I’d miss a class the start of the week, so I couldn’t. She FaceTimes me and as soon as she’s done with the small talk of “how are you” she asks why I didn’t see her and that my little sister has been asking about me. I had no proper explanation that would satisfy her so she hung up on me while I had to practically force her to say I love you. She repeatedly asks about boys and practically ignore the fact that I’m a lesbian. Overall I’m exhausted so sometimes I ignore her texts because I know it’s going to lead to “when are you coming home” “why do you never come to my house for the weekend” “you only come here to see your friends” it’s emotionally exhausting and I hate coming home now because of it. I actually plan on seeing my friends this weekend but I don’t want my mom to make a big deal out of it, for reference my car is at my moms house so I’d have to go there to get it. I don’t want to hang out with my mother even though she’s apologized to me several times, I’ve just lost all trust in her.

1o28rnk,Is anybody else’s ndad ridiculously sexist?,"I feel that there is a stark difference myself and other young women who had good, stable, loving father figures growing up. 

 A father is your first example of the way you should expect the world to treat you. 

Beyond the typical verbal abuse I got from the narcs, I just feel like being a woman made it 10x worse. A pick-me enabler mom didn’t make it any more tolerable. Women have always been the scapegoats of society, and the narc family structure reflects that, often times- at least it did for me. 

I remember one time he explained to me how ONLY when he had a daughter, did he realize women are more complex beyond A) being there to serve him like his mother and sister B) there as a sex object. The whole Madonna/Wh*re thing. 

At the same time, he always discussed his sexual business with me, his daughter, and would even slut shame me at times, and use sexuality as a guise to manipulate and undermine me. (Ex: literally telling me that “guys don’t like girls who act like whores” one time… yikes 😳 what kind of guy says that to his daughter??) 

I just wish I had a father figure who helped build my confidence instead of undermining me at every second, and a mother figure who didn’t allow him to through her enabling / pick me behavior / using me as the scapegoat or punching bag of the family. I think I would be struggling a lot less now, if that were the case. 

I feel that this is typical for straight, male, cis, white narcissist types, being at the top of the social totem poll. I can think of countless other examples of sexism I faced while living with the narcs.

Anyways, is this a common experience for anyone else? 

TLDR: Narc fathers often use their daughters as scapegoats, partially due to sexist view points, due to them wanting to reaffirm their position at the top of the social totem poll. Enabler moms reaffirm this dynamic, as I can name multiple examples from my own life where this happened. Has anyone else experienced or noticed this?

1o27ybt,Should I even try with family therapy?,"So for context, I am 26, a trans man, and I went low contact with my parents about a year and a half ago. They were very religious and would not call me he or my (now legal) name. I essentially begged them to do this, but they said I was ""manipulating them to bend to my will"" and that I was trying to get them to ""disobey God"", among other emotional and physical abuse. So, I left. In fact, I was speaking with a family therapist to try and organize a mediation, because I wanted to give it one last genuine effort before I cut them off for good.

Well, my father suddenly died of a heart attack about 3 months ago. My father was the nicest person in my family, and though he didn't call me ""he"" or my legal name, he spoke to me and treated me as though I was his son. I always thought he was the closest to coming around, and the indoctrination was just too strong. He was also the enabler, who calmed my mother down after abusive moments and support her views. 

Now all that's left is my mother, who is my main abuser. Because she still calls me ""she"" and her daughter, nobody recognized me, a 5'10"" man with a beard, at the funeral. When I went up to give a speech about my father, nobody clapped, because nobody knew who I was. People were asking my sister, ""where is your sister""? And she would point to me. When she called me ""she"", with my whole family around that ""supports me"", nobody said anything. They just let it happen. Even my sister was like ""I never called you she"", raising her hands like ""well it's not my fault"". 

The day after the funeral, I spoke to my mother about how I felt, how her calling me ""she"" and daughter led to consequences (feeling invisible at my father's funeral). She asked me how I could dare to bring this up while she was grieving her husband. She told me I was an evil human being, that I didn't care about my family, that I don't feel bad for not seeing or calling my dad before he died, and that I hate her. She also told me not to come to her funeral. I told her I did care, that I was even considering family therapy, and that she traumatized her kids. She kicked me out of the house, which she used to do when I lived there and she got mad. Now, since I live on my own, I just said ""okay"", called my friend to pick me up, and packed my stuff to leave. I broke down crying in my friend's car, and he stayed with me the whole day to make sure I was alright. 

A few days later, my mother calls me and apologizes for what she said. she said she doesn't want war between us, and that she's willing to try family therapy ""even if we agree to disagree"". I don't think she realizes that if we agree to disagree, I am cutting her off forever. Do you think it's even worth it to continue with family therapy and try a mediation? The person most likely to come around is dead now, and my sister is also an enabler. When I told my sister what happened, she said ""I'm praying for both of you"". I really wanted to give it one last shot, because my family is one of those where when things are good, they're great, and when they're bad, it's horrible. I don't have anyone else, and surviving by yourself is really fucking tough. I just wanted to visit for holidays and give calls every few weeks. I didn't plan on being involved deeply in their lives. But yeah, do you think it's even worth it to give one last shot? I'm not looking for a happy, perfect family, I just want to make cutting her off official and for my mom to be confronted with her actions.

1o26tgj,Nmom snuck a note into my art pad. Found it 11 months later.,"It reads ""I'm sorry you don't see what you are doing right now.  But I'll be waiting. -moma"" 

She had to sneak into my attic when I wasn't around and hide this in one of my drawing pads..  which is a pretty big invasion of my privacy.. Which was the fucking boundary issues we were having???? She's obviously the victim in her note.  I am so furious.  She was so fucking mean to my husband and myself when we lived there 

My (26f) husband (28) and I lived in her attic for four months while trying to save up for a house.  We paid $700-$800 on bills every month.  (She's a nurse with a massive ass house). I bought my own groceries, used my own refrigerator, cleaned my own dishes. I cleaned her space & I cleaned mine.  She never noticed anything I did or took care of for her.

What she did instead was constantly violate my and my husband's privacy.  She frequently would just not wear clothes? Around the house.  I asked her repeatedly to wear clothes please.  Not only a T-shirt w/o panties or shorts.  But I'm entirely unreasonable so she gets angry and sends aggressive texts threatening to kick us out and tells me I don't know how to talk to people.  My husband and I both had several separate sit down conversations with her about her clothes and how she needs to respect our privacy and how we both felt uncomfortable.  it just pissed her off  

She would come upstairs and just sling open the door if it was unlocked.  Who cares about mine or my husband's privacy? Better yet, if she wanted me she would beat on my door until we answered.  Doesn't matter if it's midnight and I've got to work at 4am.  But oh I have to *respect* her.  Can't go knocking on her door when she doesn't want you. Doesn't matter what you need.  

I've been no contact with her for eleven months and this just brings it all back up.  Was she fucking drunk? Is that why Mom is misspelled?   She's so fucking delusional!! I didn't do anything to her besides demand the same exact respect that she was demanding from me!! But that makes ME a fucking villian!!!  It's always MY fault! She could do no wrong.

I have to constantly tell them where I'm going and leaving, and when I've done so without telling them EVEN if it was just the college, I'd get in trouble. Once when I was caught, my father actually showed up in the parking lot unannounced. Another time they kept demanding to me to show them something that I bought that I wanted to keep private. Whenever I feel sad or bad, they try to pressure me into talking it out with them. Once I almost got in trouble for not wanting to disclose my college schedule. And also, having locked doors seems to get me in trouble as well. My mother all the time tries to come into my room without knocking and she gets surprised when I have a locked door. Unless I tell her I'm changing clothes, she doesn't leave the issue. But even then, she'd always complain when I'd lock my bedroom door when I'm taking a bath.

1o25uos,Son of Covert Narcissistic Mother - Anybody Else Struggle with These Things?,"Hey all,

Hope you're all doing as well as you can!

Woe is me I know, but I recently discovered (around a year ago) that my mother is a covert narcissist - and it feels like my world has been blown apart.

To cut a long story short, I have an adopted sister who I love very much. To my mother, she was mainly the Scapegoat and I was the Golden Child - though those roles switched at times depending on our levels of success and interaction with her (something we've only realised in hindsight).

On the outside our childhood, and even adulthood, was, and is, perfect - nice clothes, nice house, holidays, good jobs most of the time. But behind closed doors, growing up, the house was chaos. Constant arguing, inordinate pressure, gaslighting, pitting us against each other, withdrawn affection, conditional love, her needs always coming first before ours - all the typical traits of a covert narcissist mother.

She's also fallen out with everybody else in our family (she has three sisters), while my dad, as much as I do love him, has simply become an enabler.

Anyway, having found this out not long ago, I am really struggling, and with a few specific things. I wanted to reach out to see if anybody had similar experiences, and ask how they tackled them?

1. Who am I? I feel like I've lost my identity - as if my whole life has been some sort of pre-determined act put on by my mother. How do I know what hobbies are mine? What do I like? Who do I like? I am also retroactively inspecting my career choices so far and wondering if they really align with who I am, or if they are just things I've done to impress my mother so she can eventually love me and gloat about them (science first, journalist later).

**How do I discover my ""authentic self.""**  
  
2. I am fortunate enough to own a house where I live, and I have my friends here. But I feel like I need a fresh start. I have a visa which will allow me to live and work in Greece - but I am scared to take the jump. What if it goes wrong? What happens if I hate it?  
  
Does anyone else have this sort of **decision paralysis?**

I spent some time in Greece in the summer, and had these soft boundaries with my mother and felt infinitely better, so I feel I should trust my gut, but...

3. I am having **serious physical symptoms** which only really began when I came back to the UK. Acid reflux is the main one. Is this common for your body to subconsciously react to your environment?

4. **Mental health symptoms** like feeling numb, down, depressed?

5. The more I am withdrawing, the more my mother is getting involved. Inviting herself over, texting 24/7, calling at all hours - while also **trying to take control of my plans** to leave by changing them, suggesting alternatives, offering conditional financial help? The irony is, the more I cave, the worse I feel, and I go round her house and I don't even get a welcome smile or hug - I must always greet her first.

6. Lastly, though I am in therapy through the NHS (CBT for my OCD which has relapsed because of this, and arguably was caused by it unconsciously), what are the sort of therapies that are good to help recover from narcissistic abuse? Specifically from a covert Nmother, as they say?

Anyway, apologies for the long post, and I would be extremely grateful for any advice, or even for just anyone to talk to.

I am lucky to have realised this all now and all I want to do is live a healthy, happy and fulfilling life that is mine, **where I can be me - not somebody I'm expected to be.**

1o25rhp,How arguments go with my mom…..,"The argument usually starts over something small. 
You said something wrong or in the wrong tone, you did something she didn't like, you had the wrong look on your face, you forgot something, or said something she misunderstood. 

She gets mad and starts making you feel like you purposely tried to make her angry or make you feel like you're stupid. 
She puts words in your mouth (sometimes having the entire argument herself) and gets madder at you for that or she brings up stuff you've done that isn't even related to the current issue.

If you try to explain, defend  yourself, or prove her wrong she might:
Raise her voice so she's louder than you 
Mock you
Tell you to shut up
Say that you're stressing her out 
Say that one day she'll be dead 

If you cry she'll say you're playing the victim.
If you get mad, she'll mock you and call you crazy.
If you try to leave the room, she'll say ""oh yeah just run away"" or something to that effect and keep ranting even though you're not even in the room.

The only way to get through it is to just take it, be as quiet as possible, and when the switch finally flips and she's acting like nothing happened you better act like it too.

It's funny. I remember being in my early teens and trying to explain to my dad how to get through arguments with her. I had a whole playbook for it.  Now I realize that probably wasn't normal.

But my moms ALWAYS coming at me saying im not doing enough, and gets mad at me when I don’t have money to give her. I work full time, but to her it’s not a real job cause it’s at a restaurant? I’m a cook there, but oh well. I can’t add images so im going to copy and paste the text;

(For some context my checks are around $500-$600 at the moment before the add me to full time, and my friend was visiting from out of state who I haven’t seen since 3rd grade)

She texted me asking me for 💰 and this is how it went:

Me: I don't have it

Her: That's ridiculous

Her: But ok

Me: How is it ridiculous

Me: I paid electric, credit card, cash app, and was left with $200. And l've been out all day everyday doing stuff and going to stores and restaurants

Then she ignored me, and I heard her telling my sister all I do is waste money 

Me: I didn't waste my money by the way. I had a $500 check
$200 - Credit card
$50 - Electric
$100 - Cashapp
$30 - Hulu/spotify
Then I put $70 away for the car

Me: And the rest was spent this week while being out. The $70 got taken out my account from planet fitness. I'm gonna call them again and make sure it's fully canceled. But I didn't waste my money, or be irresponsible. I paid off my responsibilities, and then had fun with my friend

Her: Take electric off of there. You can't count that and your credit card when your cc is how it was paid c your adding that in twice

Her: And no I'm not arguing you on this. You're wrong.

Me: Even still, that's only around $100 spent with my friend

Me: You act like I blew my ENTIRE check on something stupid

1o24riv,I want to end myself,"I started college in another city. I had the option of either going to a dorm or staying with my aunt. I wanted the latter (and most would choose that option), but my mother didn't agree. I suspect she enjoys watching me suffer under the guise of ""you need to socialize with people,"" when I don't need to.

I have a long history of suicidal thoughts and attempts. My mental health is unstable and I have undiagnosed autism (my mother falsified the answers because she didn't want to make me look crazy for my own good, as she puts it. I also suspect she didn't want to devote more time to me than necessary. My therapy was also interrupted when my nephew was born, so they immediately started devoting all their attention to him at the expense of my therapy because ""she doesn't have time to drive me to therapy.""). I also have depression, but my mother didn't do anything to improve my condition because ""you don't have any depression.""

I basically ate nothing for days because there was no time and I didn't feel the need (I even threw up sometimes). I didn't even want to wash, eat, or get up because I felt bad there, and the thought of going back there made me nauseous. I cried because I didn't want to be there, and all my mother could say was, ""We'll talk later.""

My roommates are weird. I didn't talk to one at all (and when she heard me sobbing, she put on headphones). Another would leave me alone at 9 PM (it's very dark in my place then) in a city I didn't know because she decided to go somewhere with her friends (we were supposed to go back together).

My dorm isn't safe in general either. Anyone, LITERALLY ANYONE, can get in there. No one checks anything, so someone could get into the room if it's not locked, and even someone from the dorm could get into someone else's room and take something.

My mother, knowing this, didn't care and still won't let me move in with my aunt. She only commented on the situation with me being left alone in the city, ""Apparently, that's just how she is."" Something could have happened to me, but who cares?

Today I arrived home and started being attacked (passive-aggressively, of course). They even suggested that the situation with me being left alone in the city was my fault because ""I could have tried harder to make her like me more."" It drove me into a panic attack and hysteria. I sobbed constantly and had recurring suicidal thoughts.

Eventually, I was allowed to move in with my aunt, but as I moved again, things got worse and worse. I didn't eat willingly (my aunt forced me to), I didn't feel like drinking, I didn't feel like splurging on lectures, I didn't feel like doing anything. I also realized I didn't want to study what I was studying because I'd always wanted to be a cartoon animator, but then I was blackmailed: ""If you go, you'll have to support yourself completely,"" so I dropped out because I knew I wouldn't be able to cope (according to my mother, being an artist is shameful because ""there's no money in it, it's just a waste of money""). In my country, such courses of study aren't profitable unless you come from a wealthy family. I was always told (even by strangers, like my teacher) that my drawings were crap and that I wouldn't amount to anything in that field, so I should give it up, and I kind of believed it (my art teacher told me to draw pieces for competitions, which she then didn't submit. I know this because I saw a bunch of my work that was supposed to be submitted but wasn't. She didn't even hide it because the pieces were literally on her desk, and the deadline had passed...).

I decided to drop out of college for this year and start next year. I wanted to finish my driving test (my mother forced me to drop out) and go to therapy. My aunt, who doesn't know the whole story, told me she understood, but it was a shame it ended this way. I didn't want to burden anyone with the nightmares of my life because most people would believe my mother anyway, who can tell me I tried to kill my whole family (which, by the way, attributes to me the things my sister did. My sister tried to stab us all during a fit of rage; I was about 10 years old at the time) and says I need to be careful.

I returned home. The first thing they did was yell at me about some trivial thing and tell me how much of a problem I was. My aunt told my mother on the phone that they needed to talk to me, not attack me. That ""conversation"" never happened, just quiet sulking and avoiding me like the plague, as if my decision to go to college had caused me to try to kill them, lol. I feel like an intruder in my own home.

Now they knew I was coming back, so they took my nephew in, even though they'd known for three days that I was coming back that day. It only ended with them complaining that they had to pick me up when my nephew was home.

I'm sorry, family, that I'm a spoiled brat who doesn't know what I want because you couldn't admit to yourselves that I have depression (and autism) and suddenly interrupt my therapy because of it, because how dare someone point out your mistakes that led to this :) ",Which-Marionberry113,1760013431.0,3,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o24riv/i_want_to_end_myself/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o24riv/i_want_to_end_myself/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o2478d,A Bad Daughter,"This is going to be very long.


According to my parents, im a bad daughter because I refuse to play the role of a part time mother (whole day) to my younger brother. And it pisses me off that I've to recover everything that his teenage mind has destroyed in the house while wandering his hands through domestic stuffs.
My room, is like my world, and I stay here all day long, periodically getting out to check on my brother or find something to munch on beside meals. However, since I get exhausted doing whatever i do, including studying, crafting etc, I dont feel like decorating the whole house again and again.

It's fine to me that I've to look after him or just check on him whether everything is going fine and make him snacks whenever he's hungry. But i feel like my job is done till how much i already do remembering the fact that im still a young adult.

But when they come back home, they yell. It sounds like a bunch of ducks quacking for an hour. Initially i resist myself but then it hits me. I get mad, depressed and feel helpless. I too help with chores whenever they ask me to. Ik they get tired since they work hard all day, but how is it my fault. They keep clothes piled up on chair (i follow that since i feel like its the pattern) and then they expect the whole pile be gone when they return. 

And my father, he always makes it look like he's the source of all worldly knowledge and would try to shut everyone down if his knowledge or facts feel threatened. He also gives silent treatment to everyone without explaining the reason. And I cannot share my thoughts to any of my parents. Dont get me wrong, but being literature student, I get to experience a lot of perspective and when i see them exercising prejudice against someone for doing something they love, i try to explain them that it's wrong but here's what he (my mother similarly) do. I did the same today, attempted to explain them something where they were really wrong and my father he really felt threatened and shut me down saying that with this mentality of mine, i will never get emotional or physicalupport from people when i fall sick or need help

1o23xe0,Does your parent react differently to you crying and did you not want to cry in front of people?.,"When I read about how some of you say how your parents threaten you to stop crying, I'd like to think they're taking a far more honest approach then how my mother does which is usually an attempt to comfort me, which comes off as more disingenious and forced, as if she wants me to get better for her convenience, which I know now she is far from the only parent to do this but I've never heard from any of you that your parent does it in this way.

In primary school I used to break down in tears over little things such as not getting a chocolate for sitting ""nicely"" as in losing a game of eenie meenie miney mo when I was 9, my teacher telling me that it was none of my business after I asked why another student was in trouble out of curiosity when I was the same age, being moved to a different part of the room when I was 12 because I thought I was in trouble, in fact, I did break down in tears because I was sent to the bench for a reason that has long since vanished from my memory and I would've been around the same age. 

When I started high school, I promised myself that I wouldn't cry which was somewhat fufilled but was very difficult to because there was one teacher that I absolutely hated and could not stand him. Anyway the reason is because if I did I knew if any adult saw me they wouldn't try to comfort me not in a geniune way but in a way that comes off as disingenious and is only trying to stop me from crying for their convenience. It might seem ridiculous to people who haven't been raised by abusive parents but it's very much a real thing to me and probably to a lot of you as well.  

Nowdays I don't cry very often unless I become overwhelmed with stress but even then it's not often. 

Can any of you relate?.

1o22lzv,How to deal with disappointing nfamily on the holidays,"Hi everyone!

I am a new parent to a 5 month old little girl. She is the sweetest and my husband and I are so excited for the holidays coming up. However, I’d like some advice on how to deal with expectations around the holidays from extended family from anyone who has had to deal with the same kind of circumstances. Sorry for length of post in advance!

I have a complicated family background, and because of it I have been low contact with my family throughout the years. When I was dating my husband at the beginning of our relationship, I would rotate going to thanksgiving/Christmas with him, or some years I would go to my own family’s (hosted by my grandmother) solo. I always hated those years when I was not with him and his family. My stepfather (who has been in my father role since about 3 years old, so all I know) struggles with untreated bipolar disorder, and created an emotionally abusive environment my whole life. Periods of anger then depression, walking on eggshells every day, catering to his feelings, etc. My mother is an enabler, who since COVID years has gotten increasingly more unstable (think QAnon pipeline type behavior). My extended family is mostly varying degrees of narcissist - as I’ve gotten older I noticed that they don’t really care to know me as a human, but only check in around the holidays or for family birthdays and expect people to be there. I feel more like an item on a checklist. The holiday gatherings always tend to be short, with surface level interactions, some gift trading, and then everyone goes home on their way. Unfortunately my husband’s family lives in the opposite direction of my grandmothers, so I could never go to both in one day. I would go home at the end of the events and just wish I was there with him. I never wanted to deprive him of getting to see his family (a lot travel in from other states to be there), especially since my family’s gatherings were never fulfilling.

My husband’s family on the other hand is what I always dreamed my family would be like. Everyone gets along, loves and care about each other, knows each other on a deep level and check in/spend time with each other frequently outside of expected gathering days. Holidays are full of so much happiness and comfortability, and everyone wants to spend as much time with each other all day. It’s amazing. Since my husband and I got married 3 years ago, I’ve only gone to his family’s major holidays and I remember every one of them so fondly. My family normally makes a passing passive aggressive comment the few times I see them about how I always miss thanksgiving or Christmas, but I try to ignore it because I know at the end of the day it’s my life and I need to be happy. But I have yet to set expectations with my family that I will always be unavailable during Christmas and thanksgiving.

Onto the main reason for my post- my daughter is the first great grandchild (and first grandchild for my parents), so everyone from my family has been checking in for baby photo updates and some have visited us once to meet her. My parents have stopped by a handful of times as well to meet her. All of these visits are very supervised- I don’t trust anyone from my family to watch or be with my child alone. My grandmother has already texted me to share a Christmas list for her so people can get my daughter gifts. And I know the expectation is going to come up that they’ll want to spend holidays with her, even part of the day. But I already know I want to have her grow up with the holidays I always dreamed about - slow mornings at home, then packing up to spend all day celebrating with my husbands family being surrounded by love. Not stressing and traveling multiple places, cutting days short of where we actually want to be.

Does anyone have any advice on how to get ahead and set expectations for family you don’t spend want to spend holidays with? Do I send a Christmas list for my daughter with the caveat of please do not get us anything if you want it to be opened day of Christmas, as we will be doing our own family traditions on Christmas and won’t be available day of? Do I say no gifts needed? I’m willing to compromise and allow people to visit the weekend after to spend time with us if desired. But other than that, I don’t want to compromise on where we spend those days.

I know there’s going to be a lot of difficult conversations moving forward as my daughter gets older with my family. But any advice or support anyone can share if they’ve dealt with something similar would be greatly appreciated. I struggle with some anxiety when it comes to my family and have a long history of people pleasing that I’m always working to break, especially now since I have a daughter whose well-being will always come before others for me.

1o224vx,I was blind and this is what my Nbrother did.,"Because of my Nmother couldn't take care of us, I was mostly raised by my half Nsister and half Nbrother. They are 11 and 13 years older then me.

Looking back on what happend is very confusing to me and I wonder if someome have been in the same boat like me?

So when I finished highschool, I went for a laboratoria studdie. A year later my Nbrother did that too. But he did it in 2.5 years instead of 4 years. He never had friends there, so he was hanging around with my friends in the breaktime. During the studie he always complain about teachers and such.

After studie, I went for my first job at place A. Had a good time there. Then he decided to also work at place A. He was again complaining about work, collegues etc. He said it was a boring job, easy to understand. I ask a colleage, what also was my studie friend. She said that he was a slow learner and dont understand how things works there. 

Few years later, I was working at place B. Ques what? He also came to work there. Then again, complaining about the company and about the people. They were against him. He try to blame/frame someone to steal some medicine  and sell it on the black market? Looking back, I think he was the one who wanted to steal it. They put him on front the camera's to do his work. Why I am thinking that? He is like a medicine addict? He got a whole cubbord full of medicine, and steel some medicine from my mother. He tried it even with me, when I had it back then.

So I am wondering, can someone explain this with narc siblings? And have u been in the same boat?

1o214hd,Do they take your personal taste for a personal insult ?,"I'm really baffled by this one, especially I'd say ever since I stood up to them (they're divorced but the same) and named what they did to me, if I express personal tastes or opinion that differ from theirs or if I criticize in any way something they chose they take it as if I insulted them and told them you are worthless (of course they can disregard and attack my choices and taste). My father for example, one of many, chose an exhibition, I didn't like the painter, and he acted like I humiliated him, he was deeply angry and hurt, and I know he wasn't even a fan himself.  
  
I genuinely don't get it, I know they had a toxic relationship when they brought each other down completely but I am literally unable to have a personality in this family -- and as I got scapegoated my siblings act the same towards me, my brother literally called me ""downward stupid"" for saying I rather live in a big apartment than a gigantic mansion (like he wants), I mean.... it seems small and petty but when your choices and tastes are constantly vilified it becomes character assassination, because I mean it, they are constantly like this as soon as I open my mouth to say anything.",isamariberger,1760001051.0,60,1.0,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o214hd/do_they_take_your_personal_taste_for_a_personal/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o214hd/do_they_take_your_personal_taste_for_a_personal/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False

1o1yssa,Playing online games with my emotionally abusive? mother,"So I’m still struggling with whether or not my mother is emotionally abusive. It’s hard to say since I’m 27 and I haven’t even been out in the world yet. 

But we started an online game together. It was ok for a while…as long as she was doing better than me and I stayed the same quiet person I am with her. Since this is my only social interaction I decided to try and make friends and be someone in the game. She gets mad at me a lot for silly things there but two situations have stuck out. 

First one: each “alliance” on a server takes turn hosting a server wide event. This was my second time doing so. She helped with the first one but complained that staying awake that long for a game was ridiculous and killing her, so I decided I would do the second time myself so she could sleep. She was pissed about it and would barely speak to me that morning. I asked what was wrong and she glared at me she told me I was ridiculous, that I wanted all the glory (there is no “glory”)and she was hoping I’d fall on my face trying to do it all. She was disappointed that I didn’t. I tried to explain that I did it so she could sleep but she wouldn’t believe me.

Second one: you can trade items in the alliance. I didn’t tell her that someone wanted to exchange an item that she wanted and someone got to it before her. She again was pissed. It went into a rant about how she didn’t like who I was in the game, that I was annoying and everyone else in the game probably thought so too. I asked why they would make me an officer if I was so annoying and she told me I sucked my way to the top. I replied “so it couldn’t possibly be because they like me”, and she, with her mocking voice, said “oh you just think you’re so special” and stormed off to her room for the night. 

Sorry it’s long and it’s weird that it’s about a game but this game world is my fun thing/escape/happy place so it bothers me that she’s making me feel bad about it. I know it sounds crazy to ask but I honestly have nothing to compare it to. This is not normal right? I’m not crazy for being upset by how she’s acting over stuff?

1o1y63m,"I just need to vent, and I’m not sure where else to go","Im not even sure where to start this, because it feels like a lot. I know I need therapy, I’ve tried it in the past and I do want to do it again. 
My mom has been a narc my whole life, I actually got guided to this sub Reddit googling stuff about hating my mom. I remember growing up thinking everyone hated their mom, and when people talk about loving their mom so much and how wonderful she was I would be confused and feel shameful for how I felt about my mom.
She was horrible to me growing up. She played my brother and I against eachother. (I have no relationship with him anymore, loaded situation. It’s really sad. )I felt like a prisoner, I felt like I could do no right no matter what I did. I was constantly in trouble, no guidance. I wasn’t allowed to make mistakes or there was hell to pay. She once shut off my phone for a year because i tried to walk to school. One second she loved me, next second i was scum. It’s bad when she’s sober, but oh god is it bad when she’s drunk; and she’s a drunk. One time she called my sons fathers parents to bail her out of jail for a dui. There was a time where I was at a friends house with my daughter and brother (an hour away) and my mom started calling me and she was obviously drunk and being rude. My friend ended up taking my phone and hiding from me and I began panicking because I was afraid of not picking up my mom’s calls. Finally I answer and she says she’s fallen and hit her head and she can’t find her friends. I panick and I felt like I should go get her. So I take my daughter, and my friend drives my brother home (we all lived together, I had recently left a horribly abusive relationship). I am otp with my mom while driving and I’m like stay with me on the phone. I was like 5 minutes away when she was like “I found a ride” and hung up on me. I tried calling over and over. I end ip just going home. I get there and the front door is cracked open, and I felt sick. I walked inside into her room and she was pantless on the bathroom floor and I honest to god thought she was dead. I waited a few moments and then tried to wake her up and she did wake up. I begged her to go to the hospital because she said she hit her head and she wouldn’t let me. So I laid on the couch and listened to her breathe until i passed out from exhaustion because i was scared she would die. She’s called me a wh*re multiple times. On one occasion she called me a sh*tty mom and stayed hitting me with a lamp. There is so much more but I’d be writing a novel. Well, I went no contact with her at the beginning of 2023. I moved in with my now partner. My dad died a few weeks after that, and that made everything worse. I didn’t have a relationship with him but that’s a loaded situation as well. 
I was no contact until last nov. because my family and I were homeless and I was desperate for help. She helped us get to an old family friends house and we began having a relationship again. It felt good, and different. A few things here and there were off but I was happy to have a relationship with a parent. 
Earlier this year me and my family got an apartment and in the summer my mom came and stayed with us to leave a bad situation. I was happy to help. It was uncomfortable at the end but she wasn’t there very long. We even went on a trip while she was there and she seemed very annoyed by my anxiety (I struggle with severe debilitating anxiety). 
But I assumed it was me over reacting and that I was worried the past would happen again. 
Well, the place we lived in was awful. Middle of nowhere, mental health crisis awful. Mom moved to a nice area and I asked if we could stay with her, and she was like ofcourse. And god do I feel like an idiot. 
It hasn’t even been a month and I could tell she was getting annoyed here and there, I felt like I could see that mask slipping. But I was like no, I’m paranoid. 
I am infact not paranoid. 
I lost my phone while my mom and partner were at work and I went to go call it from her iPad (my phone isn’t on so I use WiFi and I message) I couldn’t figure out exactly how but I started looking up my email (which is in part my name) and I saw texts with my name. I know, I know I shouldn’t have looked, but I did. And she was talking sh*t and gossiping about me to her bff. I was sick. It was like everything was disillusioned for me and I realized what was going on. I’m terrified. We are going to try to get out of here asap but as you guys know things are expensive. I can already see her mask slipping and I’m terrified of the big explosion, which has happened before and is a pattern. I don’t know exactly why I’m writing here other than I need to vent/some kind of support group. I know I didn’t put a lot in here from everything she’s done but it’s so much idk where to begin. I don’t want it to be true. I don’t. I’m so devastated and disappointed and I feel like an idiot. 
I just wanted a good relationship with a parent, I just want to be loved by them. And one is dead, and I don’t think she loves me. I don’t. I remember over my life these looks of what seemed like contempt and disgust when she looked at me. I feel like she hates me.

After a lifetime of walking on eggshells, I finally did it. I told her that I would no longer engage in conversations where she screamed at me, and if she started, I would hang up the phone.

It took three days. She called, asked about my work, and the second I gave an answer she didn't like, the screaming started. My heart was pounding out of my chest, but I said, ""Mom, I'm not going to listen to this. I love you, but I'm hanging up now."" And I did.

The fallout has been nuclear. I've been bombarded with texts from her and my enabling father. I'm ""disrespectful."" I'm ""holding grudges."" I'm ""too sensitive"" and ""can't take a joke."" The latest one, the one that really stings, is that I'm an ""ungrateful daughter who is tearing this family apart because of some therapist's lies.""

1o1x2dj,I think I was poisoned?,"So when I was little, I would visit my dad at the end of the week for a few days before going back to my mom’s place. My dad was a huge narcissist and has done a bunch of abusive things bugs that’s a story for another time. During the time I kept visiting him, he suddenly started making me breakfast every morning for me and my sister. He served me and my sister the same exact food, my sister and I are somewhat the same size and have similar appetites, also I don’t have any allergies or past reactions with the food he was giving me. What started happening was after eating I, alone, would start to feel sick and throw up. My dad would care for me, let me stay home, bring me water and food, and be really nice while I was absolutely suffering. This happened like 5 times. Eventually, this obviously started to look very suspicious. My mom was concerned for my health and went to talk to him about it, after she brought it up (he denied everything) it NEVER happened again. I never threw up after going there or eating that food or portion size after that confrontation. I don’t have 100% proof he was poisoning me and I still second guess myself sometimes but I definitely believe it’s something he’d do. He never wanted me, I was a mistake, and he never actually liked me he just kept me around because having a young disabled daughter who loved him would get him some good dad points from others looking in. Due to that, I think it’s likely he poisoned me so that he could make me like him more and make people think he was “such a good dad” for “helping his daughter”. So what do yall think?

1o1wnfv,N Parents and body image? What’s the healthy thing that should have happened here?,"I have hyper mobility. I discovered it when I was 15 in high school volleyball practice when I had a minor subluxation of the kneecap. It felt like a weird and painful slipping feeling. Nobody listened when I brought it up, not even my coach. I thought “huh, that’s weird” and had the same pain in my knee when walking long distances well into my late-20’s until I went to physical therapy. I realized that part of the reason I was so resistant to exercising is because of pain while doing it; I’m not talking about normal exertion and soreness. I’m talking about joint pain from fucked up anatomy.

Now that I’m older, I’m wondering what’s normal, or I guess what would have been. Chances are, if I’m questioning it, it’s probably not normal. My parents would force me to exercise specifically to lose weight even though I was a healthy weight and height. One time, it was to the point where I passed out. My days were school, babysitting my much younger siblings, exercise, homework, chores, cooking family meals. I was so fucking lonely. To reclaim some sense of autonomy over my life, I stayed up late fucking around. Reading, watching TV, playing computer games, chatting my internet friends, blogging, journaling. The usual teenage suspects. I knew it wasn’t good for me, but I was getting maybe 5-6 hours of sleep per night to have some sense of control and agency.

To make matters worse in my stepfather’s eyes, I didn’t want to play a spring sport due to the pain. Stretching during a semester long dance class destroyed my knees even more. I was popping NSAIDs like candy. I was hurting and exhausted 24/7 and sad and lonely. My stepfather resented driving me to school, and he saw an opportunity to get out of it: force me to take the 5:30AM bus to school if I didn’t, in his eyes, make some effort to lose weight. That way, he could justify the consequence. But like, in what world does sleep depriving a teenager make anyone’s lives better? Why would sleep deprivation motivate me to exercise? Was this a developmentally appropriate consequence? Sleep deprivation really  fucks with weight loss, so I was doomed from the beginning.

And I didn’t lose a pound. I knew whatever I did wouldn’t be enough for him, and my baby feminist brain said “why the FUCK do I have to lose weight to make a man happy?” My sleep dropped from 6 hours per night to 4. Combined with the body shaming, food moralizing, and more, I now have a very complicated relationship with exercise. I developed exercise bulimia, body dysmorphia, and (shocker) CPTSD. And my knees still fucking hurt.

How would you have handled this as a parent in a normal, healthy way? How would you have supported a child in this situation? I know everything that happened was a projection of my stepfather’s own self hatred onto me, but FUCK!

1o1vj8n,Terminally ill and disabled FIL wants us to break the law,"Sorry this is long. 

My spouse (SO, 40sM) and I are very very very low contact (VVVLC), on standby to handle father-in-law (FIL)'s end of life care and execute his will when he eventually passes from a neurological condition affecting his spine. 

Mother in law (MIL) is as low contact as she can be considering she still kind of lives with him occasionally, and sister in law (SIL)'s family is firmly no contact (NC), as appropriate since he's been overtly and covertly physically and emotionally abusive to all of the family. He's tried with me, but I've never given him the chance since I have prior experience with my own narc mother.

He's still alive and somewhat well - he can eat and drink fine, transfer himself in and out of wheelchairs, even rage at everyone including the poor religious charity residential hospice staff where he's currently at. He's in a different state with a 6 hour drive between us.

Recently, he told my SO that he wants to go home to execute his advanced care plan, which was an extended suicide plan that we didn't know about (he updated it in the past 6 months). He also seems to want my SO to be present in person for the few weeks it'll take for his voluntary stopping eating and drinking (VSED) plan to take effect. Voluntary euthanasia and hastening death in any way, shape or form is criminal where we are. 

Before this, we'd left him to his own devices excluding one incident where he had a fall at home and we intervened to place him somewhere he could recuperate (naturally he hated it). Spoke to the charity in-home hospice people who couldn't help us much. 

Then we got in touch with the residential hospice people for the first time and they told us he had been abusive to the medical professionals who are trying to help him. They're recommending that he go home since he's obviously miserable and making everyone else miserable, but there's no one at home as mother in law (MIL) is away for 6 months or more. 

Technically to execute his plan this is perfect - he can get discharged home and have the in-home hospice people check in once a day, and in between he can probably do whatever he needs/wants to do. We can't influence or help him in any way to prevent criminal liability, so he's on his own for this. 

He's really upset that we spoke to the hospice because they're ""playing politics"" and we've all disrupted his plans, so he's been blowing up my SO's phone with texts in varying degrees of rage, attempts to reason/persuade and condescension. 

Honestly it's a little funny because he can't call to yell otherwise he'll show more of himself to the residents and staff, and he's not getting any response from SO beyond read receipts. I read the texts on SO's behalf and tell him anything important as it doesn't really affect me.

For now, we've put him in a timeout until next week so we can figure out what to do. We've also told him that if he continues to be abusive to anyone, we'll stop contact and only liaise with third parties like lawyers and medical professionals moving forward. 

SO, myself, MIL, BIL and SIL all have relatively strong boundaries, for SO the last straw was FIL abusing medical professionals and saying we shouldn't talk to the hospice staff because this is a ""private family matter"". SO also had a big public moment that led him to realise this was actively affecting his emotional state and his ability to make snap judgements in crisis.

Are we doing alright, have we missed anything? I'm thinking agreeing to discharge him and let him go home to be alone isn't good because we don't know if he'll do some extinction burst and somehow destroy the house that MIL still needs to live in. 

Should we tell the residential hospice that we can't provide sufficient care and leave it in their hands to hopefully get him to a government hospital? We have universal healthcare here so thankfully cost isn't a problem.

1o1u3cr,Grief for myself and victims of my narcissist father(s),"As a background, my biological father was a horrible, malignant narcissist. DV, emotional abuse, stalking, surveillance, almost anything you can think of besides SA. He absolutely terrorized my family growing up, my mom having 3 kids in a span of 2 years and being utterly alone + alienated from family. My mom left my bio-dad for a friend in 2012. That man, my now step-dad and my bio-dad were childhood friends. He was apparently perfect at first, but they got married in 2014 and he started to get ugly. Covertly narcissistic, unyielding control issues, grandeur. As a child I felt like my whole life revolved around my parents emotions, my mom's helplessness, my step dad's selfishness, and trying to be there for my siblings who couldn't really take care of themselves or self advocate. I felt all alone, on a little island where I had to bestrong enough to take care of myself. In 6th grade I completely rejected myself, my wants, my interests to try and be less of a burden on my mom. I graduated high-school with an Associates of Arts, im putting myself through college, everything to try and secure a future where I dont have to ask anything.

 Im a 20F, and was home for summer. One day, im getting dressed after a shower, and my step-dad starts BANGING on my door (I legitimately thought it was the police). I yell for him to stop, and that I was getting dressed. He didnt, and was pounding so hard and unyielding the door was shaking. I started screaming that im getting changed, and thought maybe he was mad because I toke a shower when he got home and wanted to shower? So I tell him the showers open. After minutes of this (by this time im dressed and panicking, crying), he stops and yells and me for yelling at him. He's telling me this whole time to give him my keys so he can move my car from our driveway, or else hes going to tow it. I open the door to give him my keys, and he moves my car to the street. He then proceeds to NOT PARK IN THE SPOT MY CAR WAS IN. I couldn't do anything but cry and text my mom, who realized how fucked it it was and was trying to comfort me. But I cant help but think, why didnt he care I was changing, or naked? He wanted me to open up the door that very second, I felt so violated, humiliated, and subhuman. It made me realize, so matter my age, no matter how good of a person or how much I try, no matter how accomplished I am, my experience and dignity will never be more important to him that whatever hes feeling. I realized, I spent my entire childhood trying to earn love and acceptance from someone incapable. I hated how familiar that interact felt, the worthlessness, the disrespect, the powerlessness. I hate thats how I felt as a child, and now I have a hard time not self sabotaging the goodness in my life. He still didnt see he was in the ""wrong"" until my mom hounded him about an apology (which i never got). Im proud of myself, for yelling back, for holding my ground, for not leaving the house and trying to go about my night (he wanted to make me scared enough to leave). It still haunts me, that interaction. 

My mom talked after about how he was ""doing so well"" and has regressed to how he used to be. Shes physically disabled and financially depended on him, so I feel like I cant be too critical. But I cant help the feeling of betrayal. I wonder how I would've functioned, who I would be if she picked better partners, if things didnt pan out this way. I grieve myself, and I grieve her. I understand her position, and her fawning to survive. But I dont want that for her, and I dont want that for me or my siblings. I abhor the weak, small, deficit men that have made me feel like love was a privilege, safety unreachable, and themselves forever and always above me. I hate that they've hurt and fundamentally changed the ones I love, I WISH I had the resources to take them away from all this dysfunction. I've always been my mom's confidant, I knew WAY too much about the traumas of her life at a young age. We've been deeply emeshed, and she's afraid i'll get independent and ""leave her""  in her words.

 I know this is long, but I just need someone to know. Reading this back, I can find a semblance of self love and appreciation for still trying to live a good life. I want a family, a real one, and dont want to HAVE to make one within myself, and i'm deeply grieving that thats what I have to do, finally chose myself. I want to be able to have both. I hope, whoever and wherever you are, you feel a little less alone after reading.

My NDad does this all the time. He keeps saying he doesn't want to yell. But he chooses to yell. He could communicate in a better way, he chose not to.

Just today his aide was standing right behind him while my Dad was trying to do something. When suddenly my Dad just screamed WILL SOMEBODY HELP ME! neither me or the aide knew he needed help, he never communicated that. We stood there as he did his thing and he decided we should have read his mind. 

I realized too late this is a form of psychological and emotional abuse. He uses this as a way to blame you for his lack of emotional control. YOU are why he yelled, and he doesn't WANT to yell (but he will), so clearly if he yells it's YOUR fault. And he's sorry he yelled, really he is (not), but he'll do it again, and he'll be sorry then too.

1o1thfy,My therapist told me to start grieving my mom while she’s still alive..,"So after my great grandmother died in 2019, my mom started drinking - heavily. My great grandmother was a very influential person in both of our life’s. It started off small, maybe a couple shots a week and I think it created a sense of control in her life when she felt out of control. 

When I was growing up, we were best friends but when she started drinking, she was a completely different person. Her and I started getting into huge arguments. She would drink, start a fight, say really really hurtful and mean things to me, and when I would break down crying she told me that I “only cry to manipulate and get my way”. I started to get kicked out of the house, and had my family members come to me about her and I’d have to stick up for not only myself but for them too. To a person who used to be my best friend no matter what. (In fact we got those three words tattooed on both of us. “No matter what”.)

I eventually moved across the country and our relationship has gotten much much better, however her drinking didn’t stop. We could only have a good conversation when she was sober (which is rare), if she’s even slightly buzzed (that being like 5-6 shots) she would turn back into the mother I never thought would be mine. 

She stopped drinking around 4 years ago when she got admitted into the hospital for her liver starting to shut down. Thankfully they caught it early enough for her to be able to go home without surgery. 

Then, she started drinking again about 2 years ago, and has been gone from being the loving mother I used to have, to someone completely different, once again. 

She just got admitted into the hospital again on July 27th, 2025. She was diagnosed with lactic acidosis. She was in a medically induced coma for a day, and when she woke up she asked the doctor if she was dying. The doctor told her he “was doing his best to keep her on this side of earth”. She (again thankfully) was able to become stable and go home. 

I called her a few days later (on FaceTime) and she was driving home from work. She stops and I ask her what she’s doing. She was going to the liquor store. I said “mom didn’t you literally just get out of the hospital for drinking???” And she told me that it wasn’t for her drinking it was because she had lactic acidosis. (Which is caused by excessive drinking..) and the doctor (apparently) told her she CAN drink but “like a normal person”. She told me she’s not getting vodka, she’s getting fireball instead. 

When I went to my therapist, she told me if my mom doesn’t stop, she will die from it. I should be prepared for this to happen and asked how I feel about this possibility. I told her I was really upset about it of course. My therapist mentioned that how I feel is the normal response but the unfortunate truth and advice is if she doesn’t stop, she will die from it and I should start grieving her. 

I don’t know what to do, or how to go about this. Should I call her out for it? I don’t want to start another fight. Should I let her do what she wants to and start coming to terms with her not stopping and dying from it? I’m not sure if she will stop on her own.. 

(Edit: my dad was abusive towards me as a kid. He would throw things at me, punch holes in walls, scream, and scare me. My mom would always come in to protect me and defend me against my dad.

1o1qcfc,How did you break a trauma bond? Mother is textbook narcissist. Abusive. Gaslighting. Yet I can't bring myself to move out.,"Mother who works as teaching assistant assaulted me - I have recordings. She also recently injured a child at work

I (24M) need help on with domestic abuse and child safeguarding concerns (England), and trauma bond

My mother is a teaching assistant at a primary school. I have 7+ audio voicenotes of her assaulting me over 2 years, with multiple threats of violence over the smallest things, with another 2 videos of her rages and possibly over 150 recordings of her one sided arguments to help keep my sanity of what she actually says. I have a photo of an injury she caused (broke skin, drew blood) because she asked for a coat hanger and I said give me 15 mins. The voicenote has her apologising for causing injury immediately justifying it (""if you had just done what I said""). I’ve never threatened or insulted her back and just try to make peace. I fear violence from her on a nearly weekly basis.

I am unsure of the legal implications of all this?

Another voicenote shows her forcing me to leave, insulting me, threatening me, hitting me, taking my key off me, and more, then weeks later she gaslights me on the phone claiming ""you took yourself off"" and demands I pay rent for the time I was away on “holiday” and the next time I leave all my things will be thrown outside.

Another, on a family break, 200 miles away from home, she storms in my room, drags all my belongings downstairs and tries to kick me out.

I've discovered a recent school incident report written by my mother that was like a statement she had to write for the school records. In it she writes she restrained a young child who said “no” to her and then lashed out at her. She caused bruising on his wrists to get him to comply. Reading it mirrors the very same unfolding of events that I have experienced myself where she loses her temper over loss of control over very small things.

My sister was subjected to such abuse from around 5-26, who now has severe mental health issues (bipolar, schizophrenia, psychiatric hospitalisations, unable to work) and blames a lot of it for the cruelty of my mother. Sister cut off my mum and since then I have been subjected to similar treatment and causing impact to my mental health. My mum claims “she still has no idea what she’s done” despite telling my sister things like “I’m disappointed in you” when she was shopping for her wedding dress.

I don’t know what to do. I feel trauma bonded to my mum and find it hard to leave despite having financial means to do so. Part of me as a son still loves her as my mum. I still live here and feel a bit unsafe. It’s also worse as I’m a male and there is this shame around it all, like, you’re not man enough at your age to stand up to your mother? Despite the abuse, I have setup and run 2 digital businesses successfully and have income and substantial savings (which have all been in secret). However I leave and then I get gaslight into coming back. I don’t know how to break the attachment. How can I report this of my own mother who raised me?

I worked with a clinical psychologist this week but I’ve only had one session, and their approach seems to be aimed at after the abuse has finished to rebuild your life “to figure out what I want”, not during the abuse itself. I already know what I want: to move out! But I find it very hard.

He never accepts when he’s wrong, he lacks empathy to a concerning level, he implies that he has more knowledge than professionals etc or just anyone who isn’t “on his level”, he deflects blame on the things that he’s done and some times straight up even denies it. There’s been times where my dad has encouraged me to keep self harming or commit suicide, or displayed the look of apathy on his face that genuinely disgusts me. I don’t know what’s wrong with my dad, I don’t know how to deal with him or get out of this situation, and I’m fucking fed up with him. I’ve put up with his shit for 15 years of my life where he’s verbally and also physically abusing me. 

Yesterday, I got in trouble and when I was talking to him he claimed I was trying to one up him or seem more superior than him by using sophisticated words. Mind you I was using words like “essentially” or “realize.” I just don’t know how to execute how I feel or the right words but idk what to do.

1o1p3tt,Stood up to my ndad. Is it normal to be confused?,"First of all thanks to anyone who reads this all the way through. Truly, thank you! :)

So I \[29M\] just had a talk turned argument with my n father. This after 2 months of no contact, initiated by him. The reason for this was me not wanting to add a line of text to a future reply to a happy birthday text he knew his ex would send me because she always liked me. He is not handling the breakup well and is thinking of all kinds of ways to get her back. Including using me.

Specifically he wanted me to mention an impressive birthday present that he got me (or wanted to give me). To him this was obviously a 2 birds with 1 stone situation because he would give me nice birthday present which he could have me mention to said ex to get in her good graces again. In my eyes this is (emotional) manipulation plain and simple.

First time he asked me was on the phone. He then asked me if I would notify him if she did so “we could craft a reply”. I then said that I wasn’t comfortable doing it and explained why. That it seemed manipulative and underhanded to me and I didn’t want a part in it. He then started raising his voice and said that he was about to get real mad because I was making a problem over “just adding a line of text”. I then buckled and said “fine” out of not wanting any conflict. I’m also conflict avoidant and my father knows this. So I don’t know for sure if he got so heated because of him just being very gung-ho about getting his ex back or because he knows either consciously or unconsciously that I will cave when he does that. Maybe both, I don’t know.

Then after regretting saying yes I sent him a text as I felt I could better express myself and not get as flustered. This was a milder interaction. I once again laid out to him how I felt about it and that I also thought it wouldn’t work as she would immediately know that part was my father talking through me. He once again said it wasn’t such a big deal and it would only be one line. I decided not to push it and left it with saying that this would be the last time I did something like this. No response

Enter my birthday. I very early on got a happy birthday message from my dad’s ex. I immediately got a knot in my stomach and even felt a bit nauseous about having to write that reply and mention my dad’s gift.

I texted my father right after. Quite a long message. I said I got the happy birthday text and he could send me the line he wanted me to add because I had promised I would. But after that I also laid out my feelings on the matter. Key points being that:

1. I felt it was emotionally manipulative and that he could even ask his therapist if that was emotional manipulation or not.
2. I felt disgusted and used having to do something like this
3. That this would be the last time I would do something like this

After that he sent me a half hearted happy birthday and said he didn’t want to deal with this if I was gonna be “that dramatic” and I could write whatever I wanted.

Back to today. He wanted the talk. Right off the bat he started with “What is the reason you didn’t contact me the past 2 months?”. I will save you the entire conversation. But basically it boiled down to that because he has helped me so much with various things he is allowed to “expect” that I do certain things in return. I will say that he has helped me with school, getting a loan for my house and recently by paying to have my house repainted and a roof replaced (costing €20.000 from what he told me). I would like to add that out of those things I only ever ASKED help when it came to school. The helping me find a house and then helping me being able to get a mortgage and the recent paint job and roof replacement were things he offered but I never explicitly asked for. But I was very grateful for it and I also expressed that multiple times.

He also of course had to mention that he does more to help me than my mom. But I know better and love my mom (who is emotionally very healthy and supportive, furthest thing from a narcissist) to death, and she is always there to support me emotionally and lend an ear when I need someone to talk to who understands me. Including knowing what I’m dealing with when it comes to my dad as she also experienced him.

He said that ”expecting” me to do things for him in return isn’t the same as him “asking” me to do something in return. That might in some way be true (I don’t know anymore as I’m confused at this point, please correct me if I‘m wrong). But if he reacts so harshly to me  saying “no”, even when I calmly explain why I don’t want to do it, isn’t it basically the same thing as asking I do something in return?

He also said his therapist thought I had overreacted with my text and that she didn’t think it was manipulative. To which I, in the heat of the moment, said that she might not be that good a therapist then if she doesn’t recognize that as manipulative.

For the first time in my life I refused to give in and stood my ground on that I think I did not overreact and will not apologize for what I said.

There were other things he accused me of but this post is already very long. So I will end it here 😅

If you read all the way to here, first of all thank you for bearing with me! :) Could someone tell me if I did the right thing? I feel like I did and my mom felt so too but I just feel so confused and a part of me does doubt if  I am actually in the wrong or not.

I do also feel a big sense of relief though as I stood my ground and said what was truly on my heart, even if I got emotional, frustrated during the conversation and also reacted fiercely to his accusations. So there is that :D

1o1objj,My mum’s drinking is destroying her (and breaking me again),"Potential TW: alcohol abuse, drugs, childhood trauma, SA, self-harm

I’m mainly looking for some advice or reassurance that I’m doing the right thing.

My mum has been a long-term alcoholic and drug user — mainly weed, but more recently speed. Growing up, that meant I went through a lot of really traumatic things. There was SA, encouragement of my own drinking, self-harm, and even an attempted suicide when I was a child. I constantly worried about her safety because of how often she hurt herself or ended up in dangerous situations. I was basically raised in pubs and spent most of my childhood looking after her instead of the other way around.

The home environment also affected my younger brother — he got into harder drugs and is still using today. I left home really young (or honestly, “escaped” might be a better word) and eventually cut contact with my mum. She blamed me for everything, and the adults around me didn’t do anything to help.

Around that same time, my dad was diagnosed with cancer, but I wasn’t allowed to visit him unless I made up with my mum. Later on, she went to Alcoholics Anonymous and managed to stay sober for almost a year. During that time, I agreed to reconnect with her. She apologised — part of her AA steps — but it felt really hollow. She said things like “I’m sorry for what I put you through” without actually acknowledging what that was. She also said she couldn’t remember anything because she was drunk the whole time.

At the time, I accepted it. I just wanted to have a mum again. She also told me she’d been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. But less than two years later, she relapsed and went right back to how she was — drunk, nasty, manipulative, unsafe. Now she remembers everything from my childhood but twists it whenever she’s angry and uses it against me.

She disappears sometimes — drives off drunk, goes into the forest, and says she’s seeing aliens or that they’re playing hide and seek with her. The police have called me twice now after finding her abandoned car while I was at work. I’ve had to physically go looking for her. When I try to talk to her about it, she just gets defensive, angry, and irrational.

I feel completely torn. I know deep down I probably need to cut ties again — for my own sanity — but I can’t shake the guilt or the fear that something bad will happen if no one’s keeping an eye on her. I’ve already told the police that she drinks and drives, and I’ve tried to get mental health services and hospitals involved, but every time she sobers up she acts “fine”, and they just treat whatever injury she’s got and let her go.

I’ve even told her I’ll cut contact if she doesn’t change, but clearly I’m not a good enough reason for her to stop drinking. I’m just feeling frustrated, angry, and heartbroken. I honestly don’t know what to do anymore. I’d really appreciate any advice or reassurance from anyone who’s been through something similar.


TL;DR:
My mum’s a lifelong alcoholic and drug user who traumatised me growing up. After nearly a year sober, she relapsed and is now drinking, driving, disappearing into the bush, and hallucinating. I’ve tried getting her help through the police and hospitals but nothing sticks. I’m torn between cutting contact again (for my own wellbeing) and the fear that she’ll die if no one’s watching out for her. I’m exhausted and need advice or reassurance that walking away is okay.",wingless-angel-13,1759959900.0,3,0.81,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o1objj/my_mums_drinking_is_destroying_her_and_breaking/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o1objj/my_mums_drinking_is_destroying_her_and_breaking/,raisedbynarcissists,True,True,False,False,False,,False
1o1o0ap,How to be ok with the fact that you're developmentally behind due to your parents controlling toxic ways?,"I'm now 25 about to be 26 next month. I had to move back in with my narcissistic mother because my friend and I had a falling out (turns out they were toxic too). I feel stuck and behind in comparsion to my peers. One friend owns a house, another has their own apartment. My other friends are in college pursing their dreams. I'm just here. Stuck wondering when my life will start. I already have a part time job but I am currently looking for a full time. So far not much luck given the current job market. My goal is to get a full time job so that I can afford to move out and finally live the life that I desire so that I can work towards my goals again.

Working towards my goals right now would be somewhat impossible because I struggle to be able to do anything living with my mother. Despite being 25, she still instill fear into my plans and day to day life.  She never been truly supportive of my dreams and only wanted me to do what she wanted. It's as if she wants me to be like her. She made a big deal out of me wanting to go to a concert by myself so I had to bring a friend. It would be impossible for me to travel...etc. I will say that I am proud of myself for standing my ground when I moved out and I started seeing a guy which she also tried to instill fear by making up scenarios and saying I don't have the intelligence to make informed decisions when deep down I know that isnt true.

I've struggled for years...with making decisions/trusting myself and overall self esteem. Everytime I'm faced with making a decision I get extremely overwhelmed and outweigh the pros and the cons and look to other people for help and advice because I was never able to make simple mistakes. It feels like a life or death sentence. I'm terrified of making mistakes and it backfires tremendously.

Given all this, I am a late bloomer. I'm 25 but still a child in a sense. Rarely take risks, lack self confidence, unsure, don't have a foundation. I have nothing going for myself. How can I accept this? And how do I not beat myself up over this and give myself grace? I know that it isnt entirely my fault. I remember being a kid having some confidence and looked forward to life and my goals. But now I'm at a standstill.

1o1nqwi,YOU CANNOT FIX THEM.,"I've *finally* hit my limit. I've spent my entire life at someone else's mercy.   
My health, relationships, finances and mental stability have all suffered because of the control this person had on me and I let it happen, I got sucked in, no matter how many times I left I always got sucked back in. I tried all the techniques thinking I had the upper hand and I was handling the situation now I look back, I never did. They never cared about what technique I used to deal with them all they cared about is if I was around to control and abuse.   
Now what do I have for keeping this person in my life? Fucking nothing, I didn't fix or help them at all, I was never able to mend our relationship. Now Im broke, I have no friends, an addiction, a ruined reputation, PTSD, no education and health issues due to the stress and anxiety I have been under 24/7 for decades.  
I ended up financially dependant on this person, now that I finally want to leave, I can't, I have to sort my finances out first, another way they kept me around for so long. I have to completely start my life over.  
  
I feel like I've been hit by a truck with the realisation of my situation, the regret and embarrassment I feel for staying around so long is unbearable at this moment.   
Please for the love of everything good in this world, when you can, LEAVE. They ***will*** ruin you, you cannot fix them, you cannot fix your relationship with them. They can and will live without you.

1o1mkqo,"I no longer want to celebrate birthdays or holidays, going NC when possible","I think birthdays are for kids. And I think holidays, like Christmas, have been so heavily commercialized that the real meaning is lost. I am not religious, yet for 39 years I've been celebrating Christmas with my family, who is also mostly non-religious, without giving it a second thought.   
  
This year might be different. I've become very self aware in a lot of ways and I question why I take part in these traditions just because I always have. My family has a tradition of sitting down for dinner together one night a week at my grandmother's house (where I live), usually on Sundays. It's a chance for my narcissistic father to talk about himself and all the great things he's been up to. Nothing of real substance is ever said. It doesn't bring us closer as a family. If anything it brings into focus how truly dysfunctional we are and it gives the \*appearance\* of being a close family. After dinner where my father dominates every conversation, I usually play with my sister's kids or chat with my brother in law, pretty much the only people I relate to in the family since my sister, father, and grandmother are all narcissists.   
  
I recently told my grandmother that I would be working on Sundays, since I had made a big sacrifice to take that day off for the past 2 years to have family meals. Since my family already gets together every Sunday, that is when they celebrate birthdays. After dinner, a cake with candles is brought out, everyone sings the happy birthday song, and the birthday person blows out the candles and opens presents after. I do not want to celebrate my birthday in this way. And I was unavailable on Sundays anyway due to work. The way I saw it, if people wanted to make plans with me for my birthday, they could simply talk with me about it and I would express my feelings. My family generally operates like a bunch of robots, so I already knew this was going to be an issue for my birthday.  
  
I did speak openly with my sister and grandmother about how I'd like to spend my birthday and only my sister honored my wishes. We had a meal together a few days after my birthday just to spend time and catch up. This was what I wanted for my birthday, just a kind word or to be able to spend some quality time with family. I genuinely think wrapping paper, and cakes, and wishes, and all that nonsense is for kids and it is a silly waste of time for adults. I would much rather be spontaneous or be given the freedom to do nothing at all on my birthday. Since it is my day, I feel I have the right to spend it quietly or however I'd like. Sitting around in a circle, blowing out candles and unwrapping stuff from people you have no real relationship with is the definition of fake.  
  
My sister actually listened to me and didn't get me anything, but my grandmother insisted on getting me something and asked me what I wanted. I finally relented and told her I could use a rice cooker, so she got me that. We also had a meal together that Saturday and she had a cake for me (even though I told her I didn't want a cake or any presents at all). I told her, ""I see you got me a cake anyway."" Just to reinforce that I had asked her not to get me one. She of course had wrapped the rice cooker and even got me a birthday card. I tried explaining to her that I thought it was a waste of money and also just creates extra trash to wrap presents and get people cards, but she insisted that it made \*her\* feel good and that's why it mattered. She said, ""you wouldn't want to deprive others of the good feelings they get when they give you gifts would you?"" I explained that how I wanted to spend my birthday should be what matters to others, not the feeling they get from gifting me something against my wishes. She of course didn't understand.

On my actual birthday, which was a Wednesday, my nfather sent me a very passive aggressive text. He was quite upset that I wasn't going to celebrate my birthday in the traditional way. He hadn't spoken to me about it at all, since we don't talk, but he already seemed to know my intentions. He had heard through my grandmother that I didn't want presents and wouldn't be celebrating with everyone. Even though I hadn't been coming to the Sunday family dinners for several weeks, I guess he assumed for my birthday it would be different. I'm going to post the actual messages we sent because summarizing just wouldn't hit the same:

nfather: ""We got you a nice present, but Grandma told us you didn't want to celebrate with us. We'll save it for Christmas and hope you'll spend time with your family then. Anyway, Happy Birthday! We love you and are thinking about you.""

Now for some more backstory. My sister's kids all have soccer games on the weekends and I have made it a point to go to nearly every one of their games. Meanwhile, my retired nfather and my retired step-mom haven't been to a single game all year. So even though I have missed out on family dinners, I have still been involved in my family's life. I found it strange for him to say ""(we) hope you'll spend time with \*your\* family then."" Why not, ""We hope we get to spend time with you then,"" or, ""We hope you'll get to spend time with \*us\*""? Saying it the way he did sounded accusatory or like he was lecturing a bad student. So I responded:

me: ""The way you worded that was really passive aggressive. You could easily make plans to spend time with me if you wanted. But you never call me, not once. You never talk to me about my life. You wouldn't even go for a run with me. Some macho egotism I guess. The fact I don't care to celebrate my birthday isn't because I don't want to spend time with my family. You sound ridiculous. See you later.""

I thought maybe that would be the end of it and he'd let it go, but I was wrong. The next morning, I awoke to this carefully crafted text from him:

nfather: ""We tried to make plans to spend time with you on your birthday. Family supper was a regular thing, too. You just seem to be withdrawing from everything. You didn't come to our family gathering for the 4th (but I was happy to see you at the art show opening). \*NAME\*, you don't call either, exception being when (you are in trouble). Anyway, I apologize for sounding ""aggressive"" (hopefully not as aggressive as when you screamed at me about the garage door receptacle!) I wish I could forget that day. We do need to talk about your life, too, at some point. But in person. I hate talking on the phone and TEXTING. I love you regardless of everything. I hope you had a good birthday. I hope we see you sooner than later.""

So I guess you can try to make plans with someone without actually speaking with them. And the only reason I missed the family gathering on the 4th was for a life-changing opportunity to participate in a live event called SGDQ where I helped raise over 2 million dollars for charity in the process. But that isn't what's important and it isn't meaningful to him at all. The time I screamed at him for the garage door receptacle is honestly hilarious. The garage door only has a 2-plug outlet. It's a 2-car garage, so each garage door is on a separate plug. My nfather keeps his four wheeler in the left side of the garage and my grandma keeps her car on the right side. Mind you, he doesn't live here, he just keeps his four-wheeler here. When he wants to charge his four-wheeler, he just has to remove the garage door plug to charge the four-wheeler. Instead of removing the left plug, he would remove the plug on the right, and forget to plug it back in. So then my grandma would be trying to leave in the morning and unable to figure out why the garage door won't open. This happened on two occasions and both times, my nfather was extremely defensive and said he always remembers to put the plugs back. By the second time, I was so tired of him not owning up to his actions and being so defensive. He wouldn't even let me explain how if he used the left side only, he could achieve everything he needed without touching the plug for the right side of the garage at all. He wasn't hearing my simple solution and not owning up to his actions so I screamed at him ""don't touch the (right-side) plug!"" and he was like a deer in headlights and just barely uttered an ""ok"". Later I told him I couldn't tell him if he was wearing mismatched socks (without him getting defensive) and he just didn't get that he was the problem. Also later, I added a 3-plug attachment so that both garage doors and the four-wheeler could be plugged in at all times, yet inexplicably, he would still continue to unplug and plug the four-wheeler charger from the wall (OCD?).

Anyway, this was my response to his text. I really let him have it:

me: ""You don't make any effort to understand what's going on with me because you don't care about me. You've made that much clear. I do spend time with my family. In fact I've been to nearly every one of the kids soccer games. Where have you been? You're retired. I guess you only arrange to see family if it's in a neat little routine that fits your schedule, yet you can't fathom that Sundays are simply bad for my schedule. You are very clueless and just making assumptions that I am withdrawing from family. Arranging to see your son to do something special for his birthday doesn't seem to be in your vocabulary. You're going to hold onto my birthday present until Christmas? How insane does that sound? Because you can't make 5 minutes to talk to your son? I'm going to lunch with \*SISTER\* on Friday for my birthday because she asked to do something with me. You only care about yourself. I wish you could learn from that day I screamed at you but you seem unable to self reflect to see how mindless you make decisions. You are just sleepwalking and get mad at anyone who calls you on anything you do wrong. You have always been a jerk. Maybe be kind if you want people to like you and be around you instead of trying badly to look like a tough guy all the time. Being tough isn't about being macho, it's about making the right decisions in life, even when it's hard. You aren't tough at all. You're weak and you hide behind your fear. When I asked you last year if you'd go for a run with me and you tried every excuse to weasel out of it, I knew you didn't care one ounce to spend quality time with me. How do you think that made me feel? I'll tell you, I don't want to run with you anymore. Keep running with your buddy \*FRIEND\* and I'll keep running by myself. Not everything is a competition but with you it is. When I have conversations about running because I'm trying to find common ground to talk with you on, you act doubtful and envious saying things like if I didn't write it down it didn't really happen. Downplaying anything I do and trying to steal back the limelight at your first opportunity. When I mentioned once that I was finally starting to make good money, were you proud of me? Do you remember your reaction? You doubted what I was saying was true. I thought you would be proud of me. Only if I'm not making more money than you, otherwise I guess in your warped mind it somehow reflects poorly on you. I can't wrap my head around this behavior, it's truly baffling. You are a full-blown narcissist. It's a disorder of your brain. Look it up, you check every box.""

His response:  
nfather: ""Name calling and spewing insults is unproductive and disheartening. I really do love you and worry about you a lot! You are an adult, though, and can make your own choices and live with the consequences.""

That night my sister spoke with him on the phone, but he didn't reveal the contents of the text messages. After he spoke with her, he messaged me this the next day, still clearly confused about my birthday wishes (since he still hadn't actually spoken with me):

nfather: ""Good morning. I'm sorry about the mix-up. I was told that you did not want any presents or to celebrate your birthday, which upset me. Your communications of yesterday do not change the facts that I love you and bought a present especially for you. If we can reconcile and you will accept your gift, I will gladly deliver it in person. If not, I understand.""

I did not reply. Regardless, he brought presents for me that Sunday anyway thinking I would still open the gifts in front of everyone. But instead, I did what I planned on doing which was working from my home office with the door shut because Sundays were now my days. I was taking them back. Shoutouts to Taking Back Sunday. Never speaking a word about it, he ended up unceremoniously just leaving the gifts for me on the downstairs table and leaving.   
  
Something you should know is that he is often over here once every week or two to fuss around with his four-wheeler or something else. At no point during any of these visits does he so much as stop in to say hello to me. We have basically no relationship at all. It was never about getting me something nice that I needed or wanted or to make me feel good. It was about getting recognition from all for the nice gifts he got me. That's why he still had to bring it on Sunday. That's why he couldn't just make some time to spend with me and give me the gift then. The important thing was his own feelings and he doesn't care how I want to spend my birthdays or why. So anyway, I'd like to go no contact with all three members of my family, maybe low contact with my sister so I can still be some part of her kids' lives.   
  
At our Friday birthday lunch, I told my sister I'd be going NC with our nfather and with a disgusting smirk on her face (duper's delight) she told me ""he said the same thing."" No concern that the family is falling apart. She probably doubts what I'm saying is true as well. These people think I'm a liar and a manipulator like them, but I'm just telling it how it is.

So you might understand why I don't want to sit down in ceremony with these people anymore. They are unwilling to get to know me. My father has no interest in pursuing a real relationship with me. I've made efforts in the past, but I'm only ever invited to something he's already doing anyway. I know deep down they don't like me either unless I am useful to them somehow for an ego boost. My sister has flat out told me before she was jealous of the money I was making and jealous that I got a college degree and she didn't. Things like that have shocked me in the past! I would never be anything other than proud of my sibling for achieving things. It's not like there's a huge disparity between what we've achieved either. If I tell my father something I've done, it's a chance for him to try to one-up me with something he's done. I realize I can't have a relationship with them, so I no longer wish to pursue one. Also, as a non-Christian who has a bad relationship with his family, I'd rather not keep faking it around the holidays. Families are supposed to like each other and actually enjoy making time with each other. And Christmas is supposed to be about honoring the Christian savior, Jesus, not about giving each other material things. I think Santa Claus and gift-giving has very much bastardized the real meaning behind Christmas. It should be special and it should be a time for \*Christian\* families to come together for an important message. I do not ""agree"" with Christmas being about merriment and gift giving. I think real families should already celebrate together year round with activities and outings. Christmas shouldn't be so much a celebration as much as a time for honoring and remembering Christ's sacrifice. Remember, I do not subscribe to those beliefs, but it is there for those who do! So I guess I'm just trying to get this story off my chest. Feels liberating just to talk about it. Thanks to anyone who reads or responds, I appreciate you!

**TL;DR:**  
I’ve decided I don’t want to celebrate birthdays or holidays anymore because they feel fake and meaningless, especially in my dysfunctional, narcissistic family. I told them I wanted to spend my birthday quietly or just share genuine time together, but my grandmother ignored that and insisted on getting me gifts and a cake “because it made her feel good.” My father got passive-aggressive about me not showing up for the usual family gathering, and when I called him out, he played the victim and deflected everything back on me. After a few exhausting text exchanges, I realized my family doesn’t actually want a real relationship—just the appearance of one. So I’ve decided to go no-contact with my father, grandmother, and sister (keeping low contact only to see my sister’s kids). I’m done pretending to enjoy these forced traditions and just want authenticity in my life from now on.

1o1mjer,Does anyone else get stunlocked by your parent's presence?,"Hey, chat. I dunno if this is the right place to ask, but I figure I might as well try. I ain't gonna repeat the question that's in the title, that'd be redundant, but what I DO need is advice with how to deal with it.

I, an 18 year old idiot, probably won't be moving out any time soon. There's been talks of uni, but I have no idea when that'd actually happen. Unfortunately, that leaves me stuck in a house with one unstable stay-at-home ""mom"" that immediately goes to shame anything I try to do that she doesn't like and a Golden Retriever of a father who would see it as a cardinal sin to ever even THINK about disagreeing with her in an argument.

That leaves me with a massive problem. Dad goes to work late, and mom never leaves the damn living room except to sporadically go to bed. Sometimes it's like they sleep in shifts specifically to try to piss me off, but that's beside the point. The point is that they constantly sit beside windows that let them peer directly into the shed I wanna work in, so I'm constantly paranoid about one of them coming in and saying something. Hell, most of the time it's just hating the concept of them watching me. What does that do? It disuades me from ever trying to work on anything I'm passionate about in there. How does that leave me? Completely fucking miserable in ""my own"" house.

If anyone knows how to deal with it, PLEASE tell me. I can't put up with this shit anymore. They won't let me close the door, either, because of ""safety"" or whatever. I'd rather be unsafe but unbothered, honestly, but what the hell am I supposed to do? Go against the words of mommy mearest? I'd prefer not to deal with a 2 hour zoning out session as I'm berated with ""Don't you know how this makes ME feel yada yada yada please please PLEASE let me creepily watch every moment of your life so I can bully you for it PLEASE"", thank you.

1o1l3jb,Wondering if I was SAed by my mother?,"(I’m on mobile, sorry for any formatting issues!)

So I (34 afab nb) have kinda been freaking out about this for a few months, but this is my first time actually posting anywhere about it. I’m not sure if this is the right sub, but my nmom was severely abusive (physically, emotionally, mentally) when I was growing up, and I’m worried that she might have been mildly sexually abusive too? Or at least inappropriate? I stumbled across some articles about how spanking can be SA, and it sent me spiraling. Unfortunately, about a month later I had to break my six years of NC with her since my grandmother was in the hospital. I’m back to mostly NC, but at the hospital before I left she hugged me, and I’m just….. I really haven’t been okay since then. The more I remember after seeing her, the worse I feel. I guess I’m just looking for a second opinion or advice or literally anything? I feel like I’m going insane. I don’t even think my mom is into women (though I can’t be sure) so I can’t really make sense of what was done to me or how I feel about it.  

I’m just gonna list a bunch of things I’ve recalled out: 


- there’s a video of me as an infant (6 months old or so) where she, on camera, makes jokes about me having a fetish (???)

- when I was 3-4 I tried to tell her about what I think was some CSA I was going through (I can’t remember exactly), but she shut me down so hard I was afraid to ever bring it up again.

- as a toddler till maybe 5 years old, she and the rest of my family encouraged me and a cousin of a similar age to pretend we were together and that we were going to marry. I think we might’ve kissed, maybe more than once? Looking back I’m genuinely so disturbed that they didn’t discourage that sort of behavior or explain how it was inappropriate for cousins to do that. 

- she walked around nude or in only underwear A LOT. She also encouraged me to do the same, though I didn’t anywhere near as often. She used to have me shower with her as a kid, which I know isn’t out of the norm for young children. I’m not sure when it stopped, but a few times I asked if I could wear my swimsuit for privacy and she refused to let me. I think I also slept in her bed a lot, but again, my memories of childhood are very hazy. 

- I also had little privacy in my own room. She’d come in when I was changing up until I moved out. She’d also come into the bathroom when I was showering, or I’d do the same to her, bc it just seemed normal to me back then. 

- she made me give her massages all the time in elementary school. 

- she either let one of her bfs kiss me frequently when I was like 8-ish, or he snuck into my room to do it. But I swear in my memory I can see her standing in the hallway outside the door. 

- she beat tf out of me during spankings. I was dragged into the bathroom or my bedroom and forced/held down while she yanked my clothes out of the way and just wailed on me, usually with her hand though I think she had a paddle as well. I specifically remember some instances where my underwear was wrenched down to my knees before she threw me over her lap.

- when I started going through puberty is when things got….weird. She made comments about me and made me show off parts of my developing body to her friends. When I was finally taken bra shopping, I know she touched and adjusted my boobs a lot, but I swear I remember that she let a friend of hers do it too. She continued to just touch/adjust me whenever she wanted until I left home at 19. 

- she was weirdly possessive of my sexuality? EVERYTHING was censored growing up. Any normal developmental stages I reached, she’d flip out about. At 11-12 I stole a smut book from the bookshelf once out of curiosity (though I didn’t end up reading it because the first few pages were boring as hell lol) and when she found it in my room I was screamed at and punished. 

- I was given a very censored version of “The Talk” at 12 or 13, and it was……unsettling. Basically she told me to abstain, but then she turned around and said “if you want a dildo or something to diddle yourself with, I’ll buy you some.” I recoiled in horror and she got mad and turned it around on me for acting like a prude.

- I was her emotional support through her divorce from my dad and basically her surrogate spouse from fifth grade onwards, even after she eventually she remarried. I was still censored from everything, but she’d allude to her own experiences and sex life, and gradually got more blatantly detailed with it as I aged. 

- she slut shamed me a lot when I tried to dress emo. Eventually I gave up and let her pick my wardrobe. She turned around and dressed me in uncomfortably short skirts and things that she would’ve wanted to wear. Once I turned 18, she did a 180 on the censorship, though. My senior prom dress was especially bad. She surprised me with it after I got out of a minor but painful surgery, a few days before we were supposed to go shopping together. It was so low cut I had to wear pasties instead of a bra, and there was a slit almost up to my hip. I hated it and it made me uncomfortable, but I couldn’t tell her that or she’d get mad. 

- when my stepdad was away for business, sometimes she used to make me sleep in her bed with her. I was 15-18 for those incidences. 

- when I was 16 or 17 was the event that felt extremely violating. I hadn’t been hit in a long time, but I did something that sent her over the edge. As punishment, she said she was going to spank me. Now, by this point I was already engaging in kink with bfs and gfs (her gatekeeping of my sexuality backfired) and being spanked by my mother at that age was just too much. It felt gross. I still feel disgusted by it to this day. But I didn’t have a choice. She turned it into some ritualistic event, even going so far as to let everyone in the house know it would be happening (including the company we had over for the summer). When the company left for the day with my stepdad, she made me endure it and I think she might’ve done it in front of other family members. I know that the point was to humiliate and degrade me as much as possible, and it worked. It wasn’t sexual for her, but the articles I ran into claimed SA isn’t about sexual gratification, it’s about power and control, which my mom loved to have over me. But I don’t know. It technically was just a spanking, even if it felt disgusting and disturbing and violating to me. I know it must seem so small in the grand scheme of things compared to others’ experiences, but….. I guess the vibe and energy of the whole thing felt like the bdsm experiences I’d had with other partners/abusers, and that’s what upsets me, maybe. I dunno. 

- actually, looking back now, my whole dynamic with my mom was nearly identical to the dynamic I had with a 22-24 y/o man who groomed me into a “bdsm relationship” (it was abuse, I know that now) when I was 16-17. She was in charge and I wasn’t allowed to have any say about anything. She could do whatever she wanted to me and I was so broken/brainwashed at the time that I just went along with it bc I had no will of my own. 


I just don’t know if any of this stuff actually counts. I’ve been harassed/SAed/raped repeatedly by various people throughout my life, and the spanking incident with my mom when I was 16 felt just as violating as some of the other stuff I’ve been through, but I don’t know if any of the stuff my mom has done was actually was SA. Or incestuous on some level. Or if I’m making a big deal out of it all for no reason. I’m really struggling to make sense of it, especially being offered sex toys as a child. Any outside perspectives would be greatly appreciated because I just don’t know what to think anymore.

1o1k4hm,How to stop feeling resentful and angry,"(F16) My mum is mostly emotionally and frequently physically abusive. My dad is so complacent, he either says nothing or just goes against the person who is easiest to. His excuse is work. He’ll go into his bedroom and lay down while the house is on fire. Maybe if you’re lucky the next day he’ll apathetically ask what happened. 

I have so much trouble feeling happy or neutral around them. Even when we laugh sometimes I can’t stop myself from feeling rage or feeling like bursting into tears. I feel so emotionally unregulated around them as a result.

People say I hold grudges too much or I’m a miserable human being (my parents and extended family members they gossip to). I just can’t look past things without an apology.

I don't use a filter in this post I apologize in advance for some of my graphic language. I am a sexual assault survivor from age 4 by my brother, but I'm definitely the bad one thanks because I know if there's predators that read this who have been the one to assault you will want me to shut up, it's not easy being the victim because the bad people are so scared

chat gpt already picked it apart for me I've been having a horrible time I actually threatened to kill them yesterday I know im intense I wouldn't act on that but when the behavior continues it drives me crazy. and they will say what behavior? since nothing specific really happened. my case is funny because I can never tell why I don't feel safe around them. 

chat gpt mentioned enmeshment and that felt more like the thing. so I feel like my parents can't ever stop saying "" I love you"" but strangely to me the words feel sexual and I don't like it. I might have bad trauma. When we are in the car they seem to drive extra slow amd enjoy every torturous  moment with me, they seem to be obsessed with trying to touch me but then I freak out... I feel like their happiness depends on me sometimes and I don't know why they wanted to come see me so badly and now they are here everyday is really bad. I'm a depressed person in general. That may be common in this r/ but even when I feel on the very edge I still keep going but with my parents it's just circles and circles and circles and I feel like their object their pony I wouldn't wouldn't be surprised if they mastitbated to ny photos they might not but I've always felt strangely sexually wanted around them and I hated it. To the point that I kissed my mom once when I was triggered and told her she wanted it so I was finally gonna give it and she just laughed. After my whole family got together and threatened to send me to jail for what I did.

Anyways forget about all that the next two weeks are gonna be intense suffering because of the guilt and how am I going to say I don't want to see you even if you flew all this way for two weeks or whatever. They also want to cast demons out of me as if then I won't feel incredibly weird around them and I'll just lie down accept and like that even. 

Graphic warning: I get genital discharge when they are around, my body feels unsafe, it makes me even more filled with rage which is where the thoughts of harming them come from because I feel like my no never meant no. If you ever saw me somewhere in public with my parents shouting obscenities to them it's because they don't hear me when i... use simple language... they don't hear me at all. They dont hear me at all. It's like if I try to see if Im rude enough to them if they will ever notice that I don't really like being around them or that I'm suffering. 

If anyone reads this and you think *I'm the narcissist,  that's alright too life is hard and in the end we are all ""on your own kid"" so I don't need people to agree with me it's what makes you strong

1o1iuai,Help,"TW - hard emotional manipulation and guilt tripping, mention of suicide 

Backstory - Mother and step father are life-long narcissists who neglected and abused me from age 4 to about 2 months ago when I stopped speaking to them. I told them I needed some space and I'd be in touch when I was ready. They have far from respected that, and today I received an email from my step father that said the following:


""Hi

Most of what I'm going to say is NOT designed to make you panic, it's just the truth.

What have we done? You seem to have time to speak to everyone except the one person who loves you more than anyone, your mum.

I know there are emotive terms, but I've heard ""suicide"" and ""I don't want to be here any more"" mentioned more than once and it scares me.

You mentioned your mental health but have you considered your mums? She is not sleeping, snapping at people and all in all a failing human. A while ago she was diagnosed with heart failure and we are going to see a specialist on Friday. One thing they have said is she should avoid stress or it could be fatal. Not speaking to you is not helping. She is now convinced that you must hate her and that is destroying her.

Please contact her to let her know one way or the other as this is just cruel.

We know you have packed in your job at ___ and we know that is your decision.

My immediate thoughts? I'm done, see ya later, I cannot be bothered with them and their bullsh*t any more. I've got a therapy session booked for tomorrow afternoon, and I'm fairly sure after that I'm going to write a long reply that ends with ""do not contact me again"".

1o1huh7,"""Caretakers"" stole money from my grandma's will meant for me - Stepdad threatens violence toward me - Not sure what to do","This is really depressing stuff, even for the standards on this subreddit, which is really saying a lot.

When my mother's mother passed, she passed on a will. And a lot of her descendent were meant to get it. She intended a certain amount of money for me. This was set aside by my mother, who has held it, and who I told to hand it over, for it to go into my bank account. Well, I'll admit, I put it off way too long, which is a massive mistake on my end. Though, either way, I'll have likely still experienced the abuse and theft that has commenced.

Do keep in mind, while I'm unsure whether my mother and stepfather can be called mentally ill - I don't, personally, like the term, as it seems to imply behavior is rooted biologically and not a choice - they exhibit behaviors that many would typically characterize as fitting within that label. I will say ""eccentric"" so you understand what I mean.

I asked about it, and she said she'd give it to me, but she wouldn't give the full amount. I asked why this was. She said she had to deduct a certain amount because I apparently owed her and my stepfather money. This was news to me. She had already taken the money out of the account, as my stepdad showed me him opening the bank account - where the money was set aside from me, hundreds of dollars visibly missing - where he said these payments were paid by him and my mom.

What was going on?

Well, when I was taking a trip to Mississippi, I got robbed by some crazy guy - though not as crazy nor immoral as my stepdad, I must admit - who took my phone. And as my debit card wasn't working at the time, due to a conflict with my bank that later got resolved (after I had left Mississippi, mind you), I had to go back home. I couldn't stay in the state any longer. I waited at a police station, the only one in the city it appeared (I'm still not sure if that's actually true, for what it's worth), and a cop came by, which was my only hope, and we talked. He told me he couldn't go after the suspect because there wasn't enough information I could provide of him. He did tell me, however, he could help me get home.

My plane flight needed to be rescheduled. I wasn't able to make it all the way back to St. Louis to catch that flight. I don't drive, after all. So, it had to be rescheduled within this city in Mississippi. Mind you, I was unsheltered by the time I was getting robbed, as I had just made it to Mississippi. I had not booked any accommodation, and I didn't intend to until I found a place that I thought reasonably priced. The cop knew this, as I told him this, and so did my mother and stepdad, who were alerted via phone by the police officer.

The police officer was a nice guy. My ""caretakers,"" not so much.

I understand it took money to reschedule my flight. That I presumed I was going to pay. I shouldn't have to pay it, but, hey, neither should my mother or stepfather. It obviously is some bulls\*\*t. And it took money to get me to Mississippi in the first place. Due to my card not working, I actually had my stepfather pay for the Greyhound ticket. However, I knew I was going to pay for this later down the line. Both these things are fine. I agreed to the purchases. They even purchased it under my name: the rescheduling and the ticket. I have digital receipts for this stuff, which I received immediately upon such purchasing occurring. I was even given a quote for the flight rescheduling.

I was not told of the hotel fee, however. I did not consent to the hotel fee. The cop drove me to a hotel where I'd stay the night, and he'd pick me up in the day after the next, to take me to the airport to catch my flight. I didn't ask for either thing. I didn't ask to be driven to a hotel, and I never asked him to drive me to the airport. Now, are both these things nice? Of course! Because he was a nice cop.

I didn't know how the hotel room was paid for, if paid for at all. It was never disclosed. I was never told how much I was supposed to pay, never given an invoice, never given a receipt, not even after I got a new phone. Given nothing whatsoever! My stepfather nor my mother never told me they paid for the hotel, unlike now, literally hours ago, when they revealed to me what happened an entire year ago. Never disclosed, never shown any evidence of this purchase. Even after I disclosed I wasn't staying in any hotel, of any quality, at the time for the sake of saving money, the two of them force this bill upon me.

The bill was directed at them. They decided to pay it. If I knew I had to pay it - which, legally, I don't; it's their bill exclusively - I wouldn't have stayed at that hotel for even a second. This transaction, or the fact there even was a transaction, was never mentioned for even the blink of an eye.

When I arrived in Los Angeles, at LAX, prior to boarding my next flight, I was given a free night - two nights, in fact, both free - because my plane was delayed. They didn't charge me. I stayed in that hotel free of charge, despite knowing how expensive it otherwise would be. And it was absurdly expensive. But, what do you expect for a hotel right outside of LAX?

If they had suddenly sprung the price upon me, after misleading me with it being free, it would of course be theft. That's exactly what my stepdad and mom are doing now.

They have nothing to be proud of, anyway. They helped changed my flight and booked my bus ticket? Wow, sounds like a horrible ten minutes of their time! They aren't even willing to pay for it themselves, so why are they acting like they somehow did me a favor? They did not.

This is on another level, however. This unreasonably priced hotel - a needlessly expensive hotel in a city I was going to leave anyway, almost immediately, which I had intentionally not booked any shelter in for the sake of saving money, a fact that was apparent to both the police officer and my stepdad and mom, both at the time and still today - is what they've stolen from my will for.

That money was left from my grandma, who's now dead, rest the poor soul. And this is how they respect her? This is disgusting, as well as obviously illegal. I was not billed that fee, so it's not mine to pay. I was not told of how much it'd be, because I didn't know anything was paid at all. I was only there so that the police officer would know where I'd be, so he could later pick me up and drive me to the airport, since he founded me unsheltered. My issue wasn't that I didn't have a place to stay, my issue was that I needed to get home, to leave the city and the state. That was it. And everyone knew that at the time.

They already stole it from my account they set aside for me, hundreds of dollars that I never knew I was even supposed to fee, a bill that was never disclosed nor expected. After everything, they find a way to steal from me as a result of me being stolen from that night. Putrid leeches. They've stolen from me endless times now. Every time we move, which I have no say over, my possessions get ""lost."" They just don't exist. My grease goblin stepfather owes me thousands of dollars of things that belonged to me, which he failed to bring, or intentionally left behind, without the slightest care in the world.

This man was hell on Earth to me just a mere few hours ago. Without a single bit of moral decennary, or meekness in his voice, blowing his head off on me. When he suddenly mentioned the hotel fee, something that I never even knew existed, he went up to me, just a few inches away. He has physically assaulted me in the past, and having a horrible mother, she did nothing about it. She was right there when he confronted me. Yelling his head off. He had already stolen from me, they both had, stolen the money that my grandma left for me. And saying I needed to pay this bill, or that I should've expected to pay the bill? Not really sure what he was saying. It was all a gargled mess. This ugly man, with the world's ugliest face and the world's ugliest voice, as well as the world's ugliest personality, was a moment away from attacking me again. Over him abusing me. I guess in his mind he just hasn't abused me enough.

To make matters worse, not only did they not tell me of the fee they paid, they made no mention of me having to pay it back. Hence, why I wouldn't have paid for it in the first place. It's like if I ordered a bunch of pizzas for someone. They enjoy the pizzas and even thank me. But, imagine me saying they have to pay for something I ordered, giving them no warning, out of nowhere? It'd be stealing, plain and simple. You don't take someone's wallet, without that person's consent, and go on a shopping spree for things that wallet's owner likes. And that's being generous, 'cause that's assuming they even like what they got. I didn't need the hotel. I didn't ask for me. The officer simply told me to go inside, and I did as instructed. Was never informed of any payment ever being made. I had no clue.

I don't even know what to do. They have possession of money that's for me, that someone else, near and dear, left for me. They could decide to keep all of it for themselves if they wanted to. I couldn't do anything about it. Just as they won't pay me back for all the items they've left of mine, stuff that was, effectively, stolen by them, moved without a trace nor any of my say, they won't listen to reason. I can't even talk to my stepdad about it, because the guy doesn't believe in talking. Only threatening me with physical violence, as well as screeching his grotesque lungs out. Disorderly conduct from this hideous creature on a daily basis. He doesn't use words to figure out my perspective, or to attempt to resolve conflicts.

Even messaging him afterwards, his replies were disturbing and heartless, though nothing which surprised me from me. ""Always the victim, hug?"" ""I'm allowed to abuse you because of some behaviour I didn't like from you from the past"" (That part I'm paraphrasing. He didn't deny abusing me, though).

I can't hire a lawyer. That's too expensive. It's not as if I'm automatically appointed one; only works if you've committed a crime, or at least accused of one. And, besides, I'm forced to live with this sack of dried semen. He'd just make me homeless if I ever decided to raise a finger to him. Well, perhaps he'll do that anyway, but I might as well not speedrun it. At least try to move out in the meantime.

What would anyone do in my situation? I'm so lost for words. I can barely bring myself to leave my room, because this man's abuse is so intense and out of nowhere. I'm the calmest guy in the world, and this man is constantly on the verge of breaking out into violence over crimes he's committed.",NothingExceptAMan72,1759946394.0,7,0.82,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o1huh7/caretakers_stole_money_from_my_grandmas_will/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o1huh7/caretakers_stole_money_from_my_grandmas_will/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o1hrn9,I beg you to help me with a useful comment,"So i was raised with extremely shitty parents, they both have mental issues, narcissists, both of them never employed only living on donations from their families and now donations from their famiilies still and from my siblings' paycheck, both are very failure in all life aspects, they dont have any friends at all, like ZERO,they dont love each other, they got married by arranged marriage because nobody with attracted to them and wanted them.



in addition to that, i was in religious extreme country , you have to love your parents you are obligated to love them and say yes for everything, they tortured us me and my 5 siblings soo bad physically and mentally, locking us in dark rooms, insulting us directly, and they think they doing this because they can, if we say no? god will throw us in hell, thats how we all raised, all of my siblings are very stupid enough to get their mind controlled by them, they all hated them and cried so bad when they were children now they all adults and they just love them or act like that (idk)

i was smart enough to escape the country and live alone and start from scratch at age of 18, i became homeless and they never helped with this, i still talk to them cuz i am basically obligated, otherwise i will lose them, my siblings and my whole family and society in my original country, because my parents know all my old friends and their family, its our culture over there to live with them all your life and to also marry and live with them part of the time while you are married, and they choose your dreams basically they do everything and all you can say is only YES

  
and now i cant talk to them, i call them with just phone call sometimes they only want money from money, like the plane ticket they paid for me, etc, and they blame me ""why you talk like that?"" they have no idea i hate them they think they are the best parents and we all love them,

i really dont know what to do, i am so lost, i never talked to them in anything in my life because its disrespectful to joke with them or anything, all conversations between me and them must be solid only  since i was child and i get super jealous when i see people with their parents having fun

  
i really want to talk to much because i was diagnosed with ptsd,depression, alexithymia. they think its genetics and it turned on by age 14. soo dump

A little back story im 21, my mom has been in and out of addiction my entire life, she was sober for about 8 years till the day i graduated. Then she relapsed and blamed it on me for basically growing up. Well she always had said once i get pregnant she was going to sober up, well that day came she didn’t. Then it was when I give birth she’s gonna sober up (literally came to the birth of my son high) but then after that day she seemed sober, and I’m just stupid and actually believed it. I love the relationship my son and her have, he absolutely loves her. But I visited her on Saturday and me and my son spent the day with her, come yesterday she accidentally posted a video of her smoking meth, and it was on Snapchat so it said “so and so days ago from memories” which so happened to be the day we were over there. I texted her and told her we wouldn’t be coming around anymore and that she broke my trust. I mean I didn’t know if she was going and doing that then coming and touching my child after. Ofc I got so many messages saying “just hear me out” “I’m not doing drugs” after me not responding it turned into “oh so your not gonna hear me out” I mean I hate to have to cut her off but she’s putting my child at risk and sees no issue in that.

1o1dpi5,Trying to transfer the need for supply on my baby,"So, this will probably end up to be a long post. 
I, (32F) have gone no contact for 4 months now with my nmom. I'm also almost 8 months postpartum,after having my beautiful baby boy. 

My nmom has been depressed, suicidal etc almost all my life(attempted suicide when I was 4 years old, saved by my dad, attempted again when I was 21,had to fight her body to body to be able to call an ambulance for her). 

In 2019, things got really bad, she got super depressed and paranoid that my stepfather(she's divorced my dad and remarried years ago) is cheating on her and wants to end her life. She told me this in the car. I panicked, blacked out and walked away, walked 5 km before I realized what I had done and got scared that she will actually die. Called a friend of her to help, shit hit the fan as she wanted to drunkenly drive to her friend. Got caught by the police and I had her committed to a psychiatric hospital. 

Since then, she has had on and off periods of depression, has seen on and off therapists but doesn't really do anything to actually start healing her trauma as many times she's lying to her therapists. 

Fast forward 2023( I get married), now every time she needs her supply, my husband is to blame and accuses him that he is manipulating me against her. He has tried countless times to help her, has been alongside me at different ""unaliving"" attempts to talk to her, to offer counsel, hugs, moral support etc. 

Last year, when I just found out I was pregnant, it was in the middle of a no contact episode. I had to be hospitalized because I almost lost the pregnancy, during which I was receiving horrible messages from by nmom because I've gone no contact(she didn't know at that time either of the pregnancy nor that I was in the hospital).

After she found out I was pregnant, me and my husband met with her for coffee to try and set some boundaries and reconnect. We specifically said ""if you want to be in this child's life, you have to stay in therapy and do the work"". Which, of course she didn't even attempt going back to therapy. 

This summer, out of the blue she wanted to open an account for my baby and she *demanded* I give her my baby's birth certificate so she can go open the account. I said let's meet and talk about it for a number of reasons(1.i don't trust her with financial decisions, 2. Here you need a parent to actually open an account so she couldn't have done anything by herself, 3.i don't want her to have any form of control over my son cause money has been a guilt tripping mechanism she has used on me in the past) 
That was the breaking point and I went yet again no contact. 

Today she has called me to announce yet another unaliving attempt, to which I lost my cool and started shouting some horrible things to her about how she has f-Ed my life up(I am also in severe debt because of her, but that's another separate and long story) and how I will not allow her to destroy and traumatize my child's life. And ended the call. 

Now she keeps messaging me about how my husband is manipulating me to believe that she's toxic and he's the mastermind that is trying to keep her away from me and her grandson. 

So yeah.. Very long post, most of it for venting purposes, I guess? Also I'm suspecting she is trying to now use my son as supply since he can't say no...",Imaginary-Talk-6957,1759937368.0,10,1.0,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o1dpi5/trying_to_transfer_the_need_for_supply_on_my_baby/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o1dpi5/trying_to_transfer_the_need_for_supply_on_my_baby/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o1dgqv,I haven't told this to anyone till today because I thought it was normal but slowly and slowly I have become to think it's not.,"I'm 25M, and both my parents are narc and are verbally and mentally abusive even today because I live with them as I am financially dependent on them  till two more months. 

They have always been extremely manipulative and brainwashing kind of people who made me believe that whatever they did and do is the best thing a parent should do and there is no better parent than me. Because of it I have always doubted my memories and feelings and even till date i don't understand what they did was right or wrong.

So 3 months back, after my parents were done verbally abusing me and they saw me cursing them back they got really angry and then idk what happened that my dad came to me and started to ""console me"" or ""convince"" me that I was wrong in cursing them. Later on when I didn't accept his fake words, he kissed me on the cheeks and literally spooned me from behind (Not sexually but his whole body was touching mine). Later on my mom too came and slept on the opposite side of me and they both literally sandwiched me. I felt literal chills down my spine because now I do know what kind of touch is wrong especially with a 25 year old guy. 

I did immediately pushed them both off but they were the least regretful and didn't even know if they did anything wrong. They just kept on going with their usual stuff which finally ended me cursing them at the top of my lungs. 

They have done this several times even when I was 19-20 years old but it was nowhere as bad as this(only involved sandwiching and sometimes one or two kisses(those werent kind kisses)

1o1dc8u,It's amazing how our survival response sets us up as a resource to others.,"Growing up, we were told that we were poor and could be homeless at any time. (Total lie.) As a result, I'm generally frugal as an adult, and live debt free. I'm terrified of big purchases. I live in a 1BR apartment.

I was too obsessed with doing well in school and financial survival, and also never really taught about the opposite sex, to focus on dating through my 20's. I live alone in a small town and will probably always be alone.

The result of this is that for most of my life, I've always been the first person asked to help, or the first person who volunteers to help. It's automatic. (I've tapered off dramatically the last couple of years.) Even helping out my parents. (You knew that was coming.)

It doesn't even need to be narcissists looking to use your time and resources. You just present yourself as available to people who have normal lives and need help. Because that's your only value: a source of supply to others without inherent value as a person or human.

I've been cutting people off or just straight up ghosting for 5+ years. It's sad that we're in this position, where you never really know if you have authentic relationships or simply act as a top resource for others to exploit.",FoxCitiesRando,1759936563.0,13,0.94,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o1dc8u/its_amazing_how_our_survival_response_sets_us_up/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o1dc8u/its_amazing_how_our_survival_response_sets_us_up/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o1d5ax,I think my mom is faking a tumor.,"My mother is a diagnosed narcissist. She is also bipolar. I’m her youngest. I am no contact until about a month ago when she told me about her lump. 
Background why I’m NC
I’m nc with her because she turned my family emergency (my daughter got hurt and was hospitalized) into her petty party because my sister A asked sister B to watch her kid… no one asked my mom for help, but she felt like everybody was using her and that’s all she could talk about. My kids 8 and 6 felt like she was talking about them. It snow balled into a fight that’s been going on for 5 years because I won’t budge. 

She told me about the tumor and then asked to see the kids and I told her no she hasn’t seen my kids in five years. They are both have ASD and don’t really remember her well… except for all the negative stuff she did. She played favorites. 

This is just a bit of a vent because I’m over it

1o1cpbo,Educational neglect and how to overcome it for teens help?,"Needing some help on a resource for my sibling who is desperate for foundation and needing an actual guardian or parent to care about them and set them up for success. We are in TX and my sibling is “homeschooled” and complained to me about our parents not advocating for them and not allowing them to go to public school. They’ve committed educational neglect 😭 My sibling expressed they probably have an education of a 4th grader currently. Covid happened and hasn’t been to school since. Mother hands them packets that are not up to their supposed grade level (giving a 16 y/o 3rd grade packets) and the sibling is finally recognizing that this behavior from our parents is not normal. My sibling wants to go to school so badly they asked me and my family for help AGAIN. Last time we attempted to help nothing came of it and educational neglect was something not concerning or urgent per the city/state. Everything even went as far as trying to convince our father to do the right thing for their child but they are too scared of our mom/their spouse bc “they would lose it if they found out he did something without her permission…” What resources can I provide my sibling to help them advocate for themselves since our parents are lazy, narcs, and don’t want to do anything for them? There is a 20 year age difference and I had already been through this with them but I had to fight tooth and nail to get where I’m at due to their pure laziness and our moms controlling disfunction. My sibling is crying and desperate for structure but doesn’t know what to do since they are technically high school aged. Any help, guidance, or resources where they need to start will be deeply appreciated. Trying to get the parents to sign over POA won’t work either. Please tell me there is something more that can be done besides telling my sibling they need to wait till they’re 18 to do something with their life or pressure our parents to make them do the right thing 😩 CPS won’t do anything about it like last time too.

1o1cm6k,I had a lot of anxiety and apprehension about how my wedding would go but things went well!,"I had fears that my nparent who I went NC with would show up to my wedding uninvited and attack me. She’s crashed many events before, crossed boundaries and said inappropriate things to people as well. I had flashbacks of the times she was beating me and spitting at me when I was a child so even if my fears were not exactly rational, they were there. It didn’t help that my dad owns a gun and that my mom has taken things without asking (idk if she’s ever seen the gun). My dad said he’d make sure she didn’t show up but I wasn’t convinced he was going to follow through. 

What I learned with wedding planning from bloggers is that sometimes, they encourage people to hire security guards regardless of whether or not there’s dysfunction in the family. Especially if there are a lot of people at an event. If you plan a wedding and worry about abusers crashing your wedding, you can hire off-duty police officers to handle things at your event. Sometimes you can go to the police dept’s website or the dept have a contractor to hire them. My high school would do that for the dances or football games. 

Lucky for us, we had no unwanted guests at our wedding. Things went smoothly and we had a good time! But the funny thing about the event was seeing the electronic copies of the photo booth pictures and finding out the security guards took a photo, too! They took 3 photos actually! But hey, I’m fine with that! It’s not easy being a security guard and I’m sure a boring day at the job is a good thing because it means nothing bad happened!

1o1a98i,My road,"Hi everyone. I’m writing because I feel like if I don’t get this out, I’ll explode. Over the past few days, a dam holding back 40 years of pain has burst inside me, and I’m trying not to drown.
For my entire life, I felt like something was wrong with me. I lived in a constant state of tension and fear, which I used to call “stress.” I had a “short fuse,” which affected my family — something I’m deeply ashamed of. I was diagnosed with ADHD. My body started breaking down — terrible fatigue, blood pressure spikes. I thought I was simply defective.
Then, this week, after a series of seemingly small events, everything collapsed. I saw the truth. And that truth is terrifying, but also liberating. In the span of a few dozen hours, I realized that:
I didn’t grow up in a “difficult” family. I grew up in a one-person cult, where my father was the god-tyrant, and I was his most useful tool.
His “love” and “generosity” (the house he built for me, the land he wanted to give me) were golden shackles, not gifts. They were investments in my eternal dependence.
Every passion of mine that he couldn’t control (like football) was mocked and devalued, because only what built his “legacy” mattered.
My greatest physical pain (a knee injury) was treated by him as a personal attack on his comfort (“you’ve made me suffer”).
My body had been screaming for help for years, but I didn’t listen. What I thought were my “flaws” were actually classic symptoms of C-PTSD — Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.
Now that I know all this, I feel like I’ve just survived a terrible car crash. I’m in shock. I feel anger so intense it scares me. I feel grief for the years I’ve lost. And yet, somewhere underneath, I feel a strange, quiet relief. My body is reacting to it all — my blood pressure jumps to dangerous levels (160/90+), I’m extremely sleepy and exhausted, and I can barely think straight.
My question to those of you who have been through this: How did you survive that first physical and emotional “crash” after discovering the truth? How did you deal with the somatic symptoms, the fear, and the crushing fatigue while still having to function somehow? What helped you get through those first, worst weeks?
Thank you for any advice. For the first time in my life, I feel like I’m not alone in this.

My mother thinks that I am wrong for having boundaries and emotions that she doesn’t fucking like. She says “I love you so much and I validate you” and then turns around says that I am manipulative, that I am always making myself excuses for my bad behavior, and dismisses my feelings in the same fucking breath.

Someone who will not play victim when I fucking tell them a simple fucking boundary like “I don’t feel comfortable having this conversation” or even a mere “no”. Someone who will fucking hug me and tell me that what they put me through was wrong and I am not fucking crazy for being this angry, hurt and miserable. And I am not miserable because I want to be like that as my family always fucking tells me. I am miserable because they have hurted me for so long and I have every right to just say that the emotional pain is unbearable. I just want someone to fucking give a shit about me.

1o19c5m,A very odd experience w my nmom (super curious if anyone else has had something like this happen.),"So this happened about six months ago, and I still think about it now and then.

It was quite surreal and I am wondering if anybody else has experienced something like this. 

So I moved across the country from my nparents when I was 19 and am VLC.

I flew back and was having a brief visit.

My nmom invited me out to dinner on my last night and said she wanted to me meet some of her friends and had invited two of them.

I thought that was kind of cute and sweet 🙄 so off we went.

Surprise, surprise, surprise, that wasn’t the case at all — apparently the three of them are on some sort of volunteer committee together and they had a regular meeting at the restaurant, and rather than just telling me she had a meeting that night and would be back in an hour or two, I guess she thought it would be more entertaining to tell me she was taking me out to dinner to meet her friends (so special!) and then make me sit there while they completely ignored me and had their meeting. Which tbh is fine by me. This detail is random and not really directly related to the story but such a classic nmom maneuver, I thought I would share. 😂

So my mom drove us, she has a smaller SUV, and me and her two friends were all passengers.

After dinner, we went back to the car. She was parked at a meter, and as she was pulling out, she backed into the car behind her. Just bam, right into the car parked there.

I was like, “oh my gosh, OK, it’s OK, these things happen. OK, is everyone OK, do you want me to get out and leave the note?”

Like, I was completely kind and supportive because I know how these things can spiral were I to say something that would unintentionally make her feel bad/ashamed/imperfect/you get the picture.

She responded, “what the hell are you talking about? I barely tapped it!”

I was sort of stunned, sort of confused and shocked?

I looked around and tried to make eye contact with my nmom’s two friends, my fellow passengers, to try to get a read on a very bizarre situation, but they just were looking like everything was fine.

And then my nmom just drove off.

So, it doesn’t surprise me that this happened. In terms of her hitting the parked car. And if it had been my family in the vehicle, well, they would have all been people in the “family cult” if you know what I mean, and I could easily imagine everyone looking at me like I was crazy and nothing had happened.

But these were too unrelated people. I mean, yes they were her friends, but they’re not in the cult!?!

They just acted like everything was fine and nothing weird happened and my mom drove off.

I don’t know either of these women, fwiw they seemed sassy / adorable / charming, which is precisely how my mom is.

I ask you, WTF?

Why did nobody else acknowledge we hit a parked car?

I’m really really curious if anyone else has gone through something like this.

I was surprised at my reaction, I'm still feeling like this.  I think this is so raw for me because it is strictly parental.  Everything/one else compares to each personification i.e., friend, boss, spouse, family, second cousin twice removed which may dilute the impact.

1o18nk8,Am I wrong to cut ties with my narc father? (M - 22),"  
**TL;DR:**  
Cut off my narcissistic dad who’s been bitter, negative, and emotionally absent for years. He complained about money despite making a lot, left our family, and didn’t even go to my brother’s wedding out of spite. I finally told him how I feel and feel both guilty and relieved. Since going no-contact, my life and career as a music artist/content creator have improved a ton. My brothers still talk to him but also trash him behind his back. I’m wondering if I’ll regret cutting him off or if narcissists ever really change.

I am 22 yrs old and I have cut ties with my narc father. My father the past half decade of my life has become very bitter, angry, and negative. The best thing he ever did was pay for part of my education and living while in uni, and I am so grateful for something that. However, I don't think that justifies his actions ESPECIALLY considering this man says he would always work to provide but would genuinely complain about money all the time (he was making 5-700k at one point). My older brothers also didn't get school help from him and they joined the military to pay for school. They also had to be on Medical at one point. My oldest brother owns a house and has a family of 2 and says he's never gotten good advice from our dad and it's almost like he's our enemy which can be a very common theme in narcissists. I never can get advice from him that seems genuine or will help and provide support. I know I wont agree w him on stuff bc he won't want me to take risks (VERY risk averse this man) but there are so many thing I disagree with his character.

He's left his family in California and moved to AZ where he lives alone with his gf (who he dumped for 3 days a few years ago when him and my mom were possibly going to get back together. She's very much a filler in his life.) Yes my family is messed up. He also didn't go to his own son's wedding out of spite but that's a long story. Either way there's no excuse. But I have no expressed my full feelings of never being able to look up to him, and him not being present emotionally in my life. I feel some guilt come in waves almost, but I am also very relieved. 

I am a music artist and full time content creator and that type of energy I feel has always drained me and kept me from my potential. I've done the most successful in business these past months, since cutting him off and understand now there's nothing i can do for him to change. But will I regret this? I mean can narcissists ever change? Do they just get more and more bitter then die?

 I don't even know if he has NPD, or just glimpses of narcissism. I have two older brother who have yet to full cut him off, but they talk more crap about him behind his back than I do. I try not to because that is negative but I feel they are disrespecting themselves and I was disrespecting myself by putting up with it. I just know he's someone I can't have on my team anymore.

1o187t7,Dealing with finding out that my mom didn't attend my 1st birthday,"Just for a bit of backstory. My Mom had gender disappointment when she found out that she was having a 2nd son. After she had my older brother, she wanted a daughter. But she ended up with me, a 2nd boy....

I realised from a young age that she didn't love or care for me the way that she did my older brother, and I also noted just how close she was to my female cousin.  
It was only within the last few years that I discovered what the term gender disappointment is and everything just started to click into place.

More recently, I went through a few boxes of the old family photos. Because I wanted to see if there were any photos of my mom and I together. Because I've never seen any of us both together when I was a baby/child, but she has shared a number of her and my older brother together.  
Whilst looking through the boxes, I did come across a few photos of us together. But there wasn't that many, and imo, probably were taken by family members who insisted on getting photos of her with her son....

And whilst looking through these photos, there was something that caught my attention. A collection of photos from my 1st birthday. There were photos of myself with my dad and my older brother. But there wasn't a single photo where my mom was involved.

I haven't asked my dad or any other family members yet about these photos. But I suspect that my mom wasn't there for my 1st birthday (probably just a shitty reminder to my mom on the daughter that she missed out on).

In the past a few of my family members have tried giving me reassurances that my mom was excited when she found out that she was having me, that she was over the moon on the day that I was born, and that she was the one who named me because my dad was the one who named my older brother (this was something that I didn't know).  
But, honestly.

1o1720s,Toxic people you can’t really avoid," 

How do you handle people you find draining or toxic, especially when you can’t just cut them off?  
It could be a coworker, a relative, or even an ex you still have to co-parent with. Sometimes it’s just two people in the same friend group who can’t stand each other.

These situations are part of everyday life now, and not just in person. There’s also the digital layer: texts, group chats, DMs, and social media visibility.

So the question is, how do you protect your peace without isolating yourself or feeling fake?

I’ve noticed two main ways people approach this:

**1. The “Selective” route**  
You consciously sort the people in your life into circles.  
Close friends get access to your real thoughts and updates, everyone else stays at arm’s length.  
You use privacy settings or mental boundaries to manage who sees what. It’s about keeping your emotional energy organized.

**2. The “Clean break” route**  
You stay open and kind to everyone, until someone crosses a line.  
If they disrespect you, disappear, or show manipulative behavior, you step back completely. No big arguments, just distance.  
It’s simple but strict, and it can feel very freeing.

I keep wondering which mindset actually creates a calmer, less anxious life.  
Is it better to build a structured boundary system, or to just let things flow and walk away when needed?

We all run into difficult personalities, manipulators, narcissists, people who only show up when they need something.  
Spotting them early feels like a victory, but what’s the next step after that?

If you’re naturally empathetic or generous, it’s easy to feel like being cautious makes you cold or fake.  
But maybe real strength is about protecting your peace, without losing your kindness.

And for those one-sided relationships, where someone only calls when they need help, should we accept that as part of being human?  
Or does that just keep unhealthy dynamics alive?",Bitter-Hawk-2615,1759920362.0,24,1.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o1720s/toxic_people_you_cant_really_avoid/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o1720s/toxic_people_you_cant_really_avoid/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o16mn6,I love how today’s kids are finally standing up to their parents it’s the result of their parents’ own parenting 👀,"When I was a kid, my parents were the “we know everything” type  quick mood swings, endless lectures, and zero listening. And if relatives were around, they’d always take their side.

Some of you might relate: they’d talk about what’s right or wrong for their child like they were the ultimate authority. But behind all that “guidance” was aggression, guilt-tripping, and the feeling that we were somehow a burden.

Years passed, and now those same children have grown into individuals  not just obedient sons or daughters. They’ve learned to talk back when disrespected, set boundaries, and defend themselves.

And now parents are saying, “Kids don’t even listen anymore.” 😅

But honestly, that’s the result of their own parenting. If they had chosen kindness or healthy communication instead of control, maybe things would be different.

Most of us aren’t trying to be rebellious  we just don’t want to keep acting like vulnerable children anymore.

1o14vz3,"Just potentially found out the major reason why i stopped getting invited to do things by extended family (aunts uncles) at such a young age... Turns out it wasnt out of a lack of invite, but because i wasnt allowed to if they didnt also take my brother.. who was a small child, and the golden child.","(this is an emotional vent)

Having just cut off both parents, (father temporarily)  (for different reasons but alas, I at 21 have enough room to actually focus on myself now. meaning i have to sit with myself as well as trying to unpack personal trauma,  and piece together parts of my life as my memory before the age of 10 is extremely fragmented, and unfortunately the abuse I experienced went well beyond my parents, (4 plus generations of abusers yayyy) fortunately generations prior had alot of children so there are more estranged members of the family I can get context from to try and paint a reliable picture. 

went mainly to ask about my great grandfather who was... a bad bad man. 

which lead to a discussion on the issues in our family and the enabling and denial of abuse. 

this individual is unfortunately not exempt from these problems, but is Wayyy better then most of the family, and is one of the few people whos kids dont hate her, and actually has taken steps to be a better person. 

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

anyways the conversation turned to my mother, (who is dead to me) and she said she suspected there was abuse. (she was also literally the only person in the family to call out my mother when i was a kid like fucking ever, (to my knowledge anyway,)) ( i was also told regularly to distrust her, and she was a horrible judgmental person. for thinking my mother was well a terrible mother.) i asked if she could provide a couple of examples (im very much at a stage that im still seeking external validation to not only try and get perspective but also convince myself im not making all this shit up, (despite the overwhelming evidence that yes i am not crazy and was abused) one example was during christmas pickles when i was a kid, the one i found had a better prize than my brother's and he through a tantrum over it, which resulted in both my mother and grandmother (who severely abused all her kids including my mother) screaming at me... because my brother was throwing a tantrum 

which just realizing now makes sense, just recalling that i got shit as an 8 year old, because i apparently overreacted by hiding in my room when hed chase me with one of those little steak knifes and stab into the door over and over again... (he only stopped when he eventually dropped the knife on his foot, typing this im also wondering why the fuck my parents never stopped him? they were often home.

\- I do want to mention I fucking adore my brother this is when we were small kids, hes 15 now and a good kid, who also unfortunately got shit for no reason growing up, particularly after i shut down, even if he was never the target.  my anger is solely with our parents - and the other adults who either watched on or actively participated in the abuse of us or the older generations

  
 anyways she ended up bringing up that they stopped inviting me out so much to go hiking huckberry picking farm stuff ect was because they were forbade to unless they took my brother as well, (who at the time was a child who through frequent and violent tantrums) and again my parents were home alot, 

 at this point my parents were financially comfortable to well off. enough to easily afford a babysitter, (they managed consistently to when they were not financially stable when it was just me...  

*which side tangent being expected to regularly babysit a child who Constantly through tantrums as a child while also doing my chores and was frustrating especially cuz i was defintely not equipped to handle them, and it led to multiple breakdowns of my own trying to placate him. and probably only made them worse overtime given i was a fucking traumatized child* 

*or later in life (highschool when i got get not just yelled at but a whole fucking lecture because I couldnt take my brother to piano and sit with him the entire time there because i had a club meeting on the same day, (which were bi weekly and was a club i was in for longer than he was in piano. because my father had to fucking work and what the fuck was he supposed to do. (low and behold i missed that meeting and the pressure i received to quit grew 10 fold. (i quit the next meeting)* 

  
honestly fuck both my parents, I give my father alot of slack, because he did try to be a dad like at all, which my mother didnt, and was the primary target of my mothers abuse. (my mother is a a full on lunatic, in the sense theres a complete lack of not only remorse but consistency to the point it feels like psychosis..) but he still used is 8 year old child as a therapist, and eventually ONLY emotional support and told them this regularly, and overshared way to much as they got older, paticularly about all the cheating and drugs my mom wss doing in... to much detail sometimes. while also doing alot of the same shit hed saw wasnt okay when i complained about my mom doing it.  amonsgt other things. also viewing your father as a martyr and being super fucking greatful because he stands up for you like twice when your mother starts randomly screaming about how fucking ugly you are out of nowhere. and holding that as mental proof like it somehow negates everything else isnt fucking normal

  
honestly fuck them both i think im cutting my dad off permanently after this...

Hello,

I'm working on a school assignment about people's experiences growing up under the child welfare system (for example, in foster care, family homes, or children's homes).

The purpose of the assignment is to explore how these experiences have affected our lives. I’d like to include other people's perspectives in addition to my own, so I’m asking you:

How did you become involved with child welfare services, and why? What kinds of traumas, stigmas, or other challenges did you face? How did you cope with them, and what has life been like growing up?

For example, are you studying, working, have you started your own family, or found your own path in another way?

Please share as much as you feel comfortable and safe sharing. I hope someone will feel brave enough to tell their story.

Thank you to everyone who takes the time to share their experience.❤️",yappaaja,1759910193.0,1,0.99,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o14eb6/serious_replies_only_school_project_about_growing/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o14eb6/serious_replies_only_school_project_about_growing/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False

She spreads disgusting lies, even accusing us of things with our pet cat, which people believe. We get insulted in the village and have no support from relatives, who repeat her lies.

1o14aqc,HRV before and after nc. Also allergy related illness questions. SE and polyvagual to bring safety back to the nervous system,"I’m curious how many of you have tracked your HRV when still in contact vs early stage NC and late stage NC? I’m very much into polyvagual theory and using SE to bring the ventral vagus nerve aka feeling of safety back online. Would any of you be willing to share scores? 

Book recommendation would be the healing power of the vagus nerve : polyvagal theory. Many other books recommend the same things like Peter Levine but this book framed it via biology and that’s really stuck with me. 

I haven’t tracked HRV for long but 44-55 during the NC beginning but was still in regular contact with the enabler. Now a month into cutting that im at 55-68. Noticed massages give me a much higher HRV too. 

Does anyone have any stats or timelines for how long it took to undo the chronic fight/flight/freeze of your nervous system? I’m trying to be more consistent with SE to bring safety to my body. 

Also has anyone connected the dots in terms of health issues? As a kid I had rhinitis basically allergic runny nose diagnosed as dust allergy. Teens to now I’ve had various forms of eczema and hives and just general weird skin rashes doctors found no cause to in blood tests. I’m a big fan of the body keeps the score and when the body says no. It’s just very very interesting to me that my body has literally been attacking itself. After nc it’s got better but still have bouts of it and still a lot of emotions left to process. Curious to hear others experiences.

1o13rka,My Mother Makes Me Feel Incompetent,"I just turned 19, I have two jobs, I attend college part time. My mother lost her job last year and broke her leg this summer. This has put a lot of pressure on me to work and take care of the household. My parents are not together anymore, but my dad still helps us out sometimes. I also have a younger brother that lives with us. 

Since my mother cannot move around like she used to I have picked up all household tasks. These tasks include getting my brother dressed, taking him and picking him up from school, buying groceries, keeping the whole house clean, doing all laundry, taking her to doctor appointments, picking up medication, and helping my mom with all the things she cannot do. As I said my mother does not have a job so most of what I earn, and all my savings go to my mother, groceries, bills, and gas. 

These responsibilities have made it difficult for me to focus on myself. Primarily on school and have forced me to drop two classes this semester. When I told my mother this, she told me it was my fault for enrolling in so many classes because I knew I was not going to be able to keep up. This upset me because when I enrolled in those courses, she assured me school would be my primary focus and that I had her support. 

Secondly, these responsibilities have led me to neglect my own room and personal life. I am constantly in a rush trying to get everything done and room reflects my mental state. Clothes laid everywhere, snacks and makeup on my desk, and shoes in every corner. My mother hates that my room is so untidy, but I simply am too exhausted to pick up. 

Additionally, I do not have enough time to spend with my boyfriend and that is causing a lot of arguments between us. 

Despite all I am doing my mother still does not view me as an adult. She constantly reminds me of how immature, irresponsible, and lazy I am. She tells everyone she is struggling on her own to make ends meet. She tells my grandma I am a brat and do nothing all day. Meanwhile, she lays in bed all day only coming out to eat or watch television. 


I got my license a year ago and am an extremely cautious driver. I have driven us on an expressway to another country, yet she does not believe I am ready to drive to a large city on a freeway. My boyfriend and I recently went on a trip to six flags for his birthday and I wanted to spoil him and drive us there. I did not inform my mom about it. It was almost a three hour drive, but we arrived safely. Even at 12 AM exhausted I brought us home safely. 

Yesterday my mother had a doctor's appointment in a city an hour away. I did not believe it was safe for her to drive because she could have worsened her injury or put our lives in danger. I pleaded with her to let me take her, but she refused saying she thought I was not ready. I sternly told her that if she did not let me drive, I will not go with her. Being so adamant on driving herself, I stayed home. Twenty minutes after leaving she messaged me, she said I was such a brat for throwing a fit and that I just pretend to care for her. Half an hour later after my mom messaged me, my grandma called me reprimanding me for being cruel to my mothe., Using my supposed tantrum as an example of how immature and unready I am to be an adult.

I understand how discouraging job loss and an injury are, but I do not believe it is fair for her to take it out on me. Even before this though she would berate me, tell me I will never get anywhere in life being so lazy, no one will ever want or love me with my attitude, no one will ever put up with me, and she is the only one who will because she must. So is it really the recent events, is she right, am I simply not ready to be an adult, or is she a narcissist?

1o13kg0,Need someone to convince me sending an email to my NDad is a bad idea. Or tell me if it isn't.,"A few years ago my NDad sent me a 4 page letter in the mail. At the time he sent it, it had been 5 years since I went no-contact with him. As of writing this it has now been 8 years. 

It was a letter that looked like he typed it up in Microsoft word, printed out, and mailed to me without a return address to try and hide who it was from. It boiled down to a long rant about how he had done everything for me, how my mom was the real bad buy, and how I was a disrespectful, ungrateful brat for blaming him for my problems. A lot of telling me to take responsibility while pointing fingers at everyone but himself for things he did to me. 

It was stupid and at the end had his email and phone number telling me to reply to him that way. Of course I never did.

I had it stuffed in a drawer because I saved it to show my therapist. I found it again when I was cleaning and re-read it, and it prompted me to get my feelings out by typing up a response email to everything he said in it. I told him he was a narc, he was abusive, and he was delusional, and some other things specific to the letter. 

I'm currently sitting on it trying to decide if it's a bad idea to actually send it. I will be honest and say I want to send it because I want to hurt him, there's a lot of really mean things I put in it that are my honest feelings about him.

I'm not worried about him coming after me, I live multiple states away from him and I no longer live at the address he sent that letter to. I also planned to use a service I found to send emails from a burner account with a no-reply instead of using any of my actual emails that I could see if he replied to it. 

The only reason I think it's a bad idea is because I fear of him taking it out on someone else. My sister still lives with him, even though I've made multiple attempts to try and get her out, she refuses my help. He doesn't hate my sister like he hates me, so I don't think he'd do anything to her. My mom also still lives there, and while I don't like her either because she's also an N, I don't want her to get hurt or anything. 

On the other hand, my dad is now I think 70 years old, so I don't know how much physical harm he could really do to the people I mentioned. My dad has also threatened suicide in the past, I don't know if he said that just to make people feel bad for him, but I guess I fear him doing that only because I don't want my sister to become homeless.

Should I just keep it to myself? Would anything come of it if I sent it, besides me feeling like I hurt him?

1o11o5r,How do you stop n parents from sabotaging you?,"My (24f) narcissist mother has always tried to sabotage me, ever since I was a child. I realised what she was doing only four or five years ago, I was really naive and she was the only parent I had so I was taught to basically worship her and always accept what she said.
So when I was a child I pushed my friends away because she suggested I did, I was estranged from my father’s side of the family because she always found faults in them (and obviously she would play the victim) and she even separated me from my brother (the golden child).
I started seeing who she really was when I started university and she tried to stop me from going, wanting me to stay at home and provide for her. And even though I know who she is, I don’t know how to stop her from getting under my skin.
For instance, I’m in med school and she kept saying so much that I would never be enough, that I would never graduate that I started believing her even if I knew what she was trying to do. I was in my first year, now I’m in my fourth but I still feel insecure and like I’m not enough. And I skipped a bunch of exams because of this.
Right now I am starting to drive again, after years of not doing it because she didn’t want me to use the car. She had the courage to say I’m a terrible driver, when not only I am not, I’m a better driver than her. And yet now at the thought of driving I’m terrified. How do I stop it?
I did go to therapy (for about a year), I don’t know if I just had a bad therapist but it was useless. My therapist would just ask me why I chose to be born in this family and say that there was a reason the universe put me there…  and always push me to try to talk and reason with her, when it was useless. You know how narcissists are. Every time I did it it would basically end with “Oh I guess I’m the worst mother ever and I have to die” or “that’s not true I never said/did that”. And anyway I cannot afford therapy now.
I know ignoring her is the best option and it’s not like I waste my time trying to argue with her now, but I would have to be deaf to not listen to her words.

A little insight would be helpful right now… 
Thanks in advance for reading this long post. 🩷

A little background- my mom has had several conversations with my 10 year old that should have been conversations with us, her parents. We talked to her about the boundaries, hoping that would be the end of it.  (She often brushed it off or half assed apologized) 

My family recently suffered an unimaginable tragedy, so I 
called my mom to see if she could help by picking my daughter up from school so I could process and put things somewhat back together. When I called I asked her to promise not to tell my daughter anything before I got a chance to talk to her. She said , “ I am just so hurt that you would even say that”  she wouldn’t promise or listen, she immediately made it about her. This is a common theme. 

I ended the call.

It’s been a long 37 years of hurt and I am finally ready to end the relationship.
Ho do I do that when I don’t want to keep her from her grandkids? I don’t trust her with my kids ( multiple reasons why) however, I love my dad immensely and want to remain in contact with him. He is very passive and gentle, so he’s learned to live with her abusive behavior. 
How do I do this?

When I was 15, he left the house, so it was just me and my disabled mom in this ancient run down house. He told me to lie to the school and say he still lived with me and was with my mom still.

He was also so incredibly volatile and angry all the time. He was a frightening person. He was only ever physically abusive of my oldest brother.

At school he played this humble nice teacher schtick. It drove me and my siblings crazy.

Over the last 10 years, I’ve been asking him to help support my brothers, who were both alcoholics. I asked him to check in on them periodically, to call them sometimes, and I asked him to offer to pay for rehab and flights home to see my mom and I (none of us had money). He denied they even had a problem at all, even after I told him that they told me they were su*c*dal.

Meanwhile my mom’s health is deteriorating while she’s in this house she can barely walk through without falling. And so my energy is focused on her. My dad didn’t install a single railing or hire a snow shovel. She did it all herself. She even mowed the lawn with a scythe cause the mowers were too heavy. 

I started emailing anyone I could to tell them I was worried about my mom’s life. I was begging for help.

My mom was fine but my oldest brother passed away. It was alcoholism mixed with some passive su*c*dalness. 

Now he’s trying to bleed my mom dry in a divorce, and my mom’s attorney finds out he’s been hiding literally millions of dollars of assets. I just want him to stop involving himself in shit. I want him to go away.

I don’t know how to control my anger, and it’s consuming me

1o0yeu1,Doing something I never would have thought I'd do...,"This past year has been something else I'll tell you.  My mom died in Sept 2023 and my dad has been pretty obviously losing his marbles this year.  My GC brother lives close to dad so he is stuck holding the bag as I live 600 miles away.

  
I realized fairly recently that I don't think my dad is just the enabler I thought he was, and pitied for a long time, but is also a narc.  Recognizing this, I think, totally made me give up on him this past year.  He's totally been using narc techniques, only I recognize them in him now and it makes me very sad.

  
But the thing that makes me feel bad about myself is, since he won't move out of the house I grew up in, I find myself discouraging my brother from doing anything to really keep him alive.  I just know my dad will one day fall down the long flight of stairs in that house - we tripped at times when we were under the best health - just found out he's lost a lot of vision and had his license taken away this past Saturday, had a wreck a couple weeks ago and a couple of times last year he ran into things.  

  
My dad has saved up a decent chunk of retirement, though I don't think it's enough to justify just how much he abandoned his family to work on when I was a kid, so I don't want him to spend it down on unnecessary in-home nurses or anything like that just because he won't abandon the house.  He also keeps randomly asking my brother to help him write a romantic letter to some woman he knew in high school and I told my brother absolutely not and in no uncertain terms to help him with that project as it is absolutely crazy and I don't want a dementia riddled old man giving our inheritance away to some old lady he thinks will take care of him and tend to his medical needs.

  
I just never thought I'd be one of those relatives who was waiting for their parent to die so they can receive money.  But I'm just so full of rage about them that I wouldn't even be talking to him now at all if I didn't think I was going to receive an inheritance.  My brother probably would have killed him by now if I weren't calming my brother down and giving him some kind of outlet though I can tell there are things my brother is hiding from me.  Meanwhile, my dad calls me by my brother's name half the time and has forgotten I ever had a reason to be NC with them (for 7 years I might add).

  
Just kind of depressing but what's even more so is that after my dad's death, I will never talk to my brother again - and I told him so a few months ago.  My brother has never been a very good older brother to me and won't open up to me now in our 50s either but I'm doing my best to keep him stable for the moment.",guykittywashere,1759889740.0,4,0.84,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o0yeu1/doing_something_i_never_would_have_thought_id_do/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o0yeu1/doing_something_i_never_would_have_thought_id_do/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False

So I have curly hair right? I barely got educated on it and never actually got taught about how to do my hair growing up. for context i’m a black woman and its obvious that society puts SO much pressure on us black women to look ""prim and proper 24/7.

And recently a few months ago I found this youtube channel that teaches it so simplistic and it’s really good. But I feel so ashamed. This is the type of knowledge I wouldve KILLED to know YEARS ago.

Plus with a few basic hygiene/lifestyle tips too. I feel so embarassed. Plus my mom keeps delaying EVERYTHING. that’s why I sometimes go to dad because he’s more direct and straight to the point type of person. 

My mom was all pissy because she never taught me how to clean the damn toilet bowl like bitch seriously?!? ""it’s a shame I have to teach you this"" like girl calm the fuck down?!?

1o0xtq7,Anyone else's nparent won't accept boundaries and just keeps pushing???,"I can't go no contact. We own a house together unfortunately.

I have recently snapped on her because I can't take it anymore. I feel like she ruined my life by shaping me into a person that is just broken inside. I'm 43 and I second guess myself at everything. I don't even like to socialize with people I care about because I just rip myself apart after for days. Probably sod dumb things. They probably hate me. I'm probably behaving or taking inappropriately or weirdly.

She keeps pushing to spend time with my daughter who doesn't want to spend time with her. She keeps pushing to see us. She tries to gift things because she ""loves her kids"".

I feel like I'm going to have a nervous breakdown dealing with her.  She is trying so hard to repair things without acknowledging that she did anything wrong. She's extra happy on the phone, offering to take my kid while I'm working, wants us to stop by sometime, tries to manipulate things so we have to come by.

I can't do this anymore mentally. I need her to back off but communication does not work at all.

1o0xpp3,My childs dad is a narcissist but I feel guilty for cutting contact..,"Hi all, I’m looking for advice from those that have the lived experience (hence my post here), to help me understand what the best thing for my child is. For context: 

My child is 3 and has had no contact with his dad for over 1.5 years. I fled his dad when they was 3 weeks old, he was extremely emotionally + psychologically abusive, and started to verge on physical abuse towards the end of my pregnancy. I finally found the strength to leave the day after he removed my child from my arms, placed them in a car seat and shut them in the other bedroom so he could shout at me. Leaving my poor baby crying their eyes out. 

I left and because of incidents that day the police got called, social services for involved and assisted me with staying away from the dad. They suggested I keep him off the birth certificate so he has no parental rights, I ended up getting a non-molestation order against him (like a restraining order but with less criminal weight). He breached it 10 times. 

He applied to court and got granted supervised contact in a specialist centre whilst proceedings went on, but he dropped the case when he read my evidence of abuse. 

This happened in 2023. I heard minimal from him since then. Recently he’s found my number and asked to see my child again. I’ve literally lost hair (random alopecia) since he reached out and have started some therapy again but I feel so torn. So bad for my child, wondering if they’ll resent me for not allowing them to build a relationship with their dad. 

This man has a long history of abusing women, his own mother, his family.. I’m sure he has other psychological problems (maybe bipolar or borderline personality disorder), in my head letting him have contact is just allowing my child to be abused, by him or byproxy by being in his presence when he has rageful outbursts or verbally abuses others. Not to mention the abuse I’ll have to endure letting him back into my life. 

Am I doing the “right” thing?
Has anyone experience a similar to my child?

1o0xcoq,How do you guys emotionally get over financial abuse?And maybe neglect.,"I had an unexpected crying episode over buying some expensive medication, today.

My affluent DNA Donors would steal any money that I had. Odd jobs, gifts, didn’t matter if it was in their house, it was their money.

They also refused to spend money on me. I probably had sleep for dinner more often than food. They told everyone that I had Anorexia.

After I estranged; I was poor for sometime. However, I’ve begun to “make it”. 

I decided to go to a dermatologist and an orthodontist-both of them agreed that I needed an allergist.

I went through drop therapy-absolutely life changing. The allergist put me on three different medications and I finally don’t itch all the time and my skin isn’t always peeling off. I can also finally breath through my nose and not have the mouth breathing damage to my teeth.

The orthodontist is rearranging my bite to save my back molars-it didn’t look bad, but it isn’t a functional bite, I would have lost my back molars if I hadn’t had the bite adjustment. 

The dermatologist prescribed an expensive cream to get rid of a touch of ezcema on my face that just visually bothers me-the tube was $1100. I have Cadillac insurance through my employer so I only ended up paying $30.

The cream is what unexpectedly triggered the crying. 

When everything is said and done. I expect I will have spent about $15k, getting my health in order. 

I’m more than happy to have spent that money on my health. My quality of life is so much better.

I was just getting back into my car, from being at the pharmacy, when I thought my DNA Donors *never* would have spent this kind of money on me. It didn’t matter how much I was suffering.

They also were always trying to talk about this twisted reality where I married a spouse who was just as abusive as they were-so I never had my own money.

Like I can’t believe that I have arrived at a place where I have spent 15k on myself, just because I feel like it.

I also can’t believe how much they have brainwashed me into just believing that I would not have my own money.

What are your thoughts?

1o0x1zi,My own mother made my life a hell,"So I’m a 17-year-old female. I’m an introvert and a very shy person — no Instagram, no boyfriends, and no bad habits like smoking or drinking. I’ve always had a really bad relationship with my mother since the very start. I don’t even know how to begin, but when I was a child, she used to beat me a lot for really small things — like not turning the lights off. She used to hit me with a plastic stool, a wiper, and even once tried to burn my private part with a candle when I was 5, just because I was scared of her about something and peed my pants.

With time, I grew up even more scared of her. Eventually, she got a bit more lenient — she doesn’t beat me anymore — but she still manages to make my life miserable, not financially, but mentally. She doesn’t let me go out, always compares me to my cousins and friends, but never allows me to go anywhere alone or with my friends. On my friends’ birthdays, she always yells at me for wanting to go and says that my friends are more important than family.

I’ve never had social media or a boyfriend in my life. I’ve spent my life bottling up my feelings because I don’t have anyone but ChatGPT to share them with. My dad always takes my mother’s side. She puts a lot of academic pressure on me and controls every part of my life. My school is dummy, and she doesn’t want me to go to college — she’s trying hard to make my college dummy too next year, but I really don’t want that.

Recently, I hadn’t slept the whole night because I had my economics exam and was very nervous. I gave my exam — it went well — but I got my periods mid-exam. When my mother came to pick me up, I asked to go back home, but she wanted to go shopping. I said okay. My head was throbbing from not sleeping, and I had bad period cramps. She got me some food because I hadn’t eaten anything. She shopped for jewelry, then cosmetics, and then wanted to shop for more. I just asked, “Mamma, when will we go home? I’m not feeling well, and I have another exam tomorrow. I also have to study for it.”

That’s it — she started screaming at me, saying I’m homesick and never go out with her, and that she wouldn’t shop anymore because she spent money to feed me just so I could accompany her. She said my friends always accompany their mothers. To that, I replied, “They don’t. Their mothers go shopping alone because their kids have exams.”

She started cursing me, yelling so loudly that the whole car vibrated. I was just sitting there, crying silently. She called me worthless and said horrible things, even cursed my efforts in my exams. Trust me, I literally scored 95% last year.

The minute I came home, I cried in the bathroom for three hours straight. Then my dad came and told me I should “cooperate.” It’s been four days now — we haven’t talked since.

I don’t know if I should just go and apologize, take in all her anger, and pretend everything’s fine — not that it really would be. Because she’s never going to apologize. It’s always my fault.

WHAT SHOULD I DO??

I overheard him telling his friends I’m a big disappointment because I never became a successful unlike his friends children, but mind you—those kids got the full support of their parents, my dad always talked down on me and made me feel very small at a young age he always told me I will never succeed in life. 

He also has never said anything nice about me but called me a user, a narcissist and a girl who lives in her head—who just dreams but never does anything—thing is WHEN I DO HE MAKES SURE IT GETS RUINED. 

He has promised to help me multiple times only to tell me “I’m not dumb enough to help you. I won’t waste my time and money on any of your ideas” 

My therapist says I tend to live in my head because my brain created a safe space for me to save me from further pain. I tend to cling onto the idea of a certain celebrity to help me get through the day. 

Even to my mom he says a lot of bad things about me and I usually overhear them and just retreat back into my room. 

When I’m sick my mom worries about me and he says “She’s just acting. Making excuses” even when he does see that I’m in pain, and it makes me hurt even more to know that my own father says these thinfs about me

1o0v5bx,Sick to death of my N mother’s victim mentality,"I don’t want to rant on too much but I realised my mum is technically a victim of my N Dad but she continues to play into a victim mentality and has not made any effort whatsoever to improve herself or her life. 

My mum came to this country (UK) at 19 after she married my dad in an arranged marriage back in her home country. He is ten years her senior. She lived with in-laws (dad’s mum and dad and his brother and his wife) for the first 11 years who were horrible to her. My N dad is a useless spineless coward who never stuck up for her because his mummy’s opinions mattered more than being a man and defending his wife.

However, my N dad did actually encourage my mother many times to become independent, he even paid for her to attend English classes so she could learn to integrate into the country better, but also because he was tired of having to do everything for her. But she REFUSED. She attended a couple of lessons but then gave up bc she decided she was “above” the country she chose to migrate to and its national language……… she is now in her 50s and cannot even book a doctors appointment on her own bc she just wants my dad to do every single thing for her. This pisses me off so much bc so many men in our culture are very controlling of their wives but my dad actually *wanted* my mother to be independent yet she CHOSE not to take any of those opportunities and now wallows in self pity 24/7.  

Growing up, my nursery and primary school was a 10 minute walk from our house. My mum was a SAHM and she was late every. single. time. My friends mothers who lived further (like 30 mins walk) and didn’t have cars were always on time to pick up their kids. My mother’s excuse was she found it “hard”……… yeah I also found it hard to wait in the reception area every fucking day. She was even once an HOUR late. My dad had to eventually call his dad (I don’t like calling him grandfather since he was verbally and emotionally abusive to me) to come and pick me up instead. 

You’d think her being a SAHM would mean the house would be spotless every time, but NOPE, the house was always a mess because my mother actually spent most of her mornings talking to her friends and family back in her home country on the phone every morning for hours, or she’d just sit and watch tv. 

This is the same woman that now complains how no one understands how hard being a mother is, how the world should feel sorry for her, and how women who are independent are “show offs”……….. I really, really can’t wait to get the fuck out and never have to listen to any of her bullshit rantings ever again.

1o0us0h,“Coincidences” and their fakery they don’t realize we can see right through,"This isn’t so much a rant as a rambling “I wonder if putting this into words will ring true to others” commentary.  I was awake, in the night, and trying to find the words for this (bear with me).  Within my family, particularly with my nMom, it’s like (maybe because they accept no responsibility for anything?) she had to find (make up) magical moments.  She told people her last husband had been the love of her life, since they were kids, even though he had been a few years younger than her and she never mentioned him (even when *I* had dinner with his mother, years before) until she realized he lived somewhere special.  

It’s like, life is never special enough - there has to be some fake connection to everything.  When I *have* experienced those “lightning in a bottle” moments, I feel like a quack for enjoying them, now, because it’s been ruined for me.  Everything has to be twisted into a “magical” experience.  For people who wield power, they sure don’t seem to understand that they COULD take real credit for real things, instead of making crap up, all the time.

A few years ago, my kid was visiting her and she took kid1 to the animal shelter she volunteered at.  I don’t know how I wasn’t prepared for it but, that night, when kid called, they were telling me about the dog they’d fallen in love with, with a pleading tone. Mom got on the phone and gushed about this perfectly unexpected bond (and I withered inside, realizing this was another weird machination to create an “isn’t it wild how things turn out?!?” event).  

And they don’t get how transparent they are!  Like, MOM, seriously!  Rather than playing the meanie, again, I said I’d have to look at the logistics.  Called mom back the next day and explained that, the system for transferring animals between countries had to be managed from her end (truth).  Sent her the links for who to contact, and the forms for the undertaking.  It isn’t even legal for ME to be involved on her end.  She’d need to go through a company, there, and all the checks and fees had to be done from her end.

I felt bad for my kid, because they got roped into the whole thing.  In my heart I knew that mom wasn’t thinking about they fun they’d have together (her husband refused to take my kid to do anything touristy because he doesn’t like that people do that there, btw) but the whole time before kid even got there, she was probably planning this big moment, where her coworkers would be able to fawn over this amazing story, etc etc etc.  When she realized the cost of the rep she’d have to hire, the forms, AND that SHE had to pay the quarantine costs, up front, not another word was said.  I’m sure it was still considered to be my fault, but I took on none of it.

Over the years, I’ve come to sort memories into different categories, but the “fake magic and their belief that we can’t see what’s real” box is really full.  It reminds me of part of the old ACOA text “The Problem” where they say our parents lied even when it would have been easier to tell the truth.  

One sort of funny aside here.  Not realizing what it means to be an empath, I once asked my husband “is it just me or do other people see right through manipulative things people say?”.  He assured me that they do.  I told him that it makes no sense that people continue to be false if they know everyone sees what they’re doing, right?  Turns out he’s also empathic, so together we’ve spent about 40 years wondering why people are so blatantly obvious, without understanding that not everyone DOES see through it.

1o0u7ve,"nMom convinced the entire family they have a disease, now they're desperate for me to go get tested for it.","Nmom has diagnosed illnesses in just about everyone. My dad was bipolar and autistic and my aunt had Epstein Barr and just whatever she found on the internet or Facebook until she found something else. I haven't spoken to her in over ten years but I see my (37yo)brother and his kids so I learn things through them. It turns out nMom has discovered a gold mine called ""Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome"" and it turns out my (24yo) brother definitely has it. My aunts have it, my mom also has it. They're going to need to go to therapy as a family for this. It's genetic. Everyone has it. nMom is sacrificing everything by taking care of the entire family. 

I should add it's not really something that can be definitively tested for, afaik. 

I get a call from my brother ""so is your skin stretchy? are you hyper mobile?"" I'm like, what the fuck does any of this even mean? I'm mobile, I move uhh...  so he explains that we all have this disease. ""I thought we were bipolar"" no, not anymore, now we have this genetic disease that evidently gives us aortas that can explode. I'm like, no one in our family has ever had exploding aortas they all get cancer at like 80. Well, anyway, I should go get checked for this disease. I said no I'm good if my aorta is going to explode I'd rather not know. I called my paternal grandmother to ask if anyone in our family had messed up aortas and she said my nMom is the only disease in the family ""she's a tumor""

My aunt calls me the next day. I really should get this checked out. My aorta could explode, it's all they can talk about. I said, I thought we were all bipolar? She says I'm making fun of her and her pain. I said, when did nMom tell you about this disease? my Aunt is kind of shocked and I expect her to say she found out from her doctor and she's like ""two weeks ago and I have ALL the symptoms"" I told her to go look at nMom's Facebook posts and likes from the day they spoke and then to call me back. Then I said, actually, don't call me back. I look forward to the next disease! Haven't heard anything back since mid-September.

Edit: this is all clearly from Facebook and none of us have this because it’s disease of the month. I feel bad for those who actually do have this disease which sounds dreadful.

1o0u5be,I feel lost & overwhelmed with the reality that I’m like my abuser (trauma dump TW),"I’ve been in therapy for 4 years and been seeing a psychiatrist for about 1 year. My father is a diagnosed Narc, and I was both the golden child and the scape goat at times. My father had a very strange emotional relationship with me, including internet stalking, threatening his life, and accusing me of selling drugs, Asking my romantic advice, ect. My 2 sisters and I have a damaged relationship (now growing in it tho) because we were pitted against each other and triangulated. 

When the abuse started getting really bad (physical threats, and drug accusations) I was also dating someone who had a severe anxiety disorder and some manipulative controlling traits, along with a friend at the time with her own stuff at home but would turn into she thought I was constantly sabotaging her. I continued to seek these people out in relationships subconsciously (mainly romantic) because it made sense to me in a twisted way. So this lead to not super great choices for myself in partners, and where I’ve been graped and SAd on multiple occasions (some has taken me years to understand). I fawn really bad, and have a deeper abandonment wound than I thought. My therapist and I talk about how growing up with a narc parent can prime you for emotional abuse, and therefore I continue to search for the “love” that’s most familiar to me in other people. 

When I was a kid my father told me I was a narcissist and always said that I was just like him. This would piss me off and I would spiral. I never want anyone to feel the way he ever made me or my sisters or my mom feel. My mom told me one time (I don’t think she remembers) “no matter how I raised you, you always end up like your dad” mainly bc I got tattoos. But nonetheless, hurt so deeply. Our abuser. You’re telling me I’m like our abuser. I’ve always felt severely misunderstood or that how I viewed myself never lined up with how my family viewed me. 

I went no contact with my father about 2 years ago, he of course would still call and text so maybe low contact. I just recently blocked him on everything 2 months ago, I was too scared to for a while. 

Right now I’m seeing the cycle of abuse for what it is. For the first time since I started therapy, I can see how my trauma is reflecting and causing pain on others. I tried to be in a relationship recently and fully went off the deep in, socials stalking, monitoring every word, fawning and becoming a chameleon, pushing away at the first sign of “unsafe”, making up unlikely stories to validate my anxiety spirals, people pleasing type manipulation, ect. When it takes over it’s overwhelming and takes me hours in the gym or 3-7 miles to walk out. I started therapy so I would NEVER be like my father, so I could release the trauma, and because it is so physically uncomfortable to feel this way. I refuse to let this be my reality. But the reality of being a product of my environment is heavy. It’s my own to work through, just (holy f*ck) sucks ass. My father has trauma too, and his father and so forth, I want it to end with me, and I feel like I’m failing or am I just in the thick of it?


All this to ask, What did you do while processing the abuse that helped you end the cycle?

1o0tzwa,Should I get back in contact with my n mom?,"My Nmom which whom I have been in no contact for the past 2 years told my underage brother she'd ask me to join her for the new eves reunion (I live abroad with my husband and 2 years old son). She had also pointed out that she has no ""problem"" with me but I've got one because I'm brainwashed by my husband (she had idolised my husband until he blocked her a few months ago). She is the classic narc mom and had different hovering strategies the past few years:
1. Spread lies about me and my husband to force me to reply.
2. Lied that she has cancer and will die in a couple of years to force me to reach out while actually having a benign tumor
3 Used my wedding to show off
4 Allowed my underage brother (16) to visit me (abroad) and gave me money through him to buy something for my 1 year old son (she didn't allowed him to visit me in the first year we went no contact)
5. Much more...

I'm now asking myself:

Would I live happily knowing she wouldn't change or still going no contact still knowing she wouldn't change? It's just been so sad for me the past few years. I've bought a house and I've started sending ms MIL pictures in order to share my happiness about it and much more.

1o0tyhf,Just. Food for thought?,"This is a collection of events verbatim: 

Hello, I’m a gay man from a small county in the north (29yo). Since I was young  taken on the role of the family scapegoat. Essentially raised by grandparents, was both expected to be invisible as to not upset a jealous kiddult immature beyond her years (their daughter, lizzard). I was told constantly that I could be both taken away by social services, so felt I was never welcome or wanted, they would pretend to phone social services which constantly had me In tears, until I begged my nanna to phone them. I felt trapped, and even as a kid, like I couldn’t endure this forever. Other times they would drive off and pretend they’d left me by the side of the road, again, tears. Physical abuse was normal, such as being punched under my duvet after running upstairs knowing I was, in their words, ‘in for a hiding’. Or just casually throwing a VHS tape at me while angry. 

I have had my sexuality basically constantly trashed, told I’m not who I say I am, when all the signs to my sexuality were there, they just didn’t care to look. I have only ever liked men romantically, only attraction men, only ever dated men. 

Look, there’s so much. I have been abused by my aunt (lizzard) since I was very little, called evil, told I was going to end up just like my dad, told I should be seen and not heard and the door literally slammed in my face while my cousin (the daughter, let’s call her K) was allowed in the room. ‘Little boys should be seen and not heard’ she’d say. On top of the my cousin, K, sexually…interfered with me, we were in uniform, I was in the bedroom where my nanna and granda last resided before my nanna passed awag, that was my bedroom at the time. It was after school, pretty sure there was bunk beds. 

My uncle L is a robber , his brother G, my dad, accused him of domestically abusing and controlling a former girlfriend. He was a serious burglar and mixed up in drugs and lot (all this applies to my dad too, apart from the abuse). 

I had a much older boy who used to pin me down and call me his subbed allowed to babysit me, with his cousin or aunt or something, Ch**s, he was called. 

My dad G, who I want name as he has passed away and I’m still coming to terms with, didn’t treat me like a villain. But he did push my sister down the stairs and covered it with ham and butter, cover all three of us in cow patty, and emotionally and verbally assaulted us to tears. I was months old, my sisters under 5, and we were taken off my parents for a reason I don’t know, when I was placed in care for months. 

K’s (my cousin) dad (S) and his friend was accused of sexual assault by my other cousin, and S’s brother liked to drop his trousers in front of her sister. 

I feel like my life is a carnival, like a disaster and nightmare I can’t escape from. I left as soon as I could, to better myself, which only led to destroying my life further. I was a sex worker, but now in therapy, and trying to make the best of my situation.

I have been blamed for everything, ganged up on by a family who doesn’t love each other, and all I ever wanted was to get away from them. I dreamed as a kid being with a family who loved me. I spent my teenage years thinking nobody would care if I killed myself. I had multiple, suicide attempts from a single digit age to my late teenage years. 

I just want anyone. To hear this, and just understand. That I’m not a liar, that I’m not delusional, that I’m not just crazy. Because the gaslighting is forever, and I’ve only shared the tip of the iceberg. 

K also used to position her dolls in sex positions, Barbie specifically, pretty sure her room had a pink carpet. Uhhh, yeah, also me and my friend found my…relatives some how, porn card game stash in Scotland Glasgow, aunt Millie’s house, was staying , and K said ‘oooh that gave me the horn’. So, yeah. Just gonna keep adding from memory, until I it’s all archived. 

Lizzard said my boyfriend was committing statutory rape because I was 17 and he was 18, then proceeded to say that ‘16 is the legal age of consent’ but she said it was changed back for gay people. She also told my cousin Amy, she wouldn’t accept me because I’m gay. I also came out to her, and she outed me to my grandparents, and seemingly that was a good thing, but it’s kind of…wrong, stealing a moment, while also not knowing how they’d react, and that i was extremely drunk and confided in them. 

I went to hospital once, suicide attempt, didn’t want to talk about it, Lizzard was basically saying I have no right to withhold that information from my grandparents. But I went there, on my own. I got back, on my own. 

I remember once also, I was acting frustrated because I’d come back from my dads, and nobody was listening, I cut myself, and the police came, basically I spent a night in a cell, and nobody came to collect me until well in to the next day. Late evening. So I spent nearly 24 hours in a cell, for being in crisis. Facts. 

That wasn’t my first self harm. The amount of times I wanted to jump out of the window as a kid. I was small, so yeah. I remember being pulled back angrily, and punished for it. 

K used to ask me to put music on her iPod and shit too…like, idk. I look back at that, then thing, why? These people spit on me. 

You know what’s funny? Liz was kind when she wanted something, like genuinely. Fixing her computer? Wow, so kind. But then not, not all the other times. 

My Lizzard lied to my dad’s ex. She said that I held a knife to my grandad’s throat. I need to clarify, I could never do that, it was like a huge invite wall between ever being able to do that. I think she means the night I cut my wrist, I don’t know, but fuck no I swear on all I love that have past, and my friends I didn’t. She also said I kicked my nanna, I kicked a toy, I remember the one with shapes moving from one side of the wire being in the room, I kicked a fucjing toy. And she spun it, because it makes a better story to villainise. Anyone could tell you, I lashed out with words, fucking hitting my nanna and granda. Me and my cousins got in to scraps when I was younger, which I regret, genuinely, makes me feel…terrible. But never my nanna or granda. I need to add I kicked that toy to artificially act out, I did it, it was manipulative, but I wanted mental health help. Back then. Even in my own psychiatry I was never alone, I love my nanna so much, but she was always there, only briefly ever alone, and I never opened up. The gay thing was big, but I never opened up about that. I always felt anything I said would be reported back, and in that family, that was dangerous. 

I’ve internalised being abused with being loved. It’s messed up and I’m working to undo all of that, but it’s hard wiring, and it’s gonna take a lot of work. Masochism isn’t healthy for me, it just reassures me I’m worthless, and object, unlovable unless it comes with a side of abuse. 

I always…I remember getting hit, for not wanting to go to school because it was a place of bullying, refusing. My granda was hitting me, and I got met with the ‘don’t jock, he’s not worth it’…

I spent most of my life, with my grandparents bad mouthing my mum, getting in to arguments over it, even when I was little. And I mean around age 5. Lizzard would say things about my dad constantly. One time, she said about his then until the end girlfriend, Toni, ‘he must have something big down there because she doesn’t know what Toni sees in him’. They would constantly comment on how bad he smells also, and that he was always after money. 

.After Lizzard outed me, there was a lot of awkwardness. My nanna had a hard time accepting me, but my granda seemed to, I’m not sure how true this is. Considering everything that followed. The thing is I came out as ‘bisexual’ to my cousins girlfriend, a right of passage for gay kids trying to test the water, well documented, and she outed me to me nanna. My cousin, Sean basically argued with my nanna saying ‘I hope he’s not one of them’ (gay people). 

.People don’t understand how much gay kids fight to get to that stage. Things are moving forward, but the double standards, the homophobia is there, what I’ve learned is, I like my homophobes outwardly homophobic, not people who say things like ‘it doesn’t bother me that you’re gay’ (a common phrase by cousins), not accounting for the fact I really couldn’t care less what their opinion is on the matter, their idea that I need their approval was never even a factor, nor did it sit right with me. 

.Safeguarding wasn’t really a thing in that house. The thing is, once the period was over, I had been taken in by my grandparents with social service visits etc. there wasn’t much in the way of follow ups. Discussions about how adding so much chaos to the house, which did happen would negatively influence my development. 

.I remember as a kid, being forbidden to go to. Neighbours house, with children the same age, because they were looked down on by my grandparents, addicts, their house was messy etc. but my nanna would take me to my aunts, equally involved in drugs, equally unsterile. 

.Just a random but telling thing. Growing up, there was a lovely woman across the street, peculiar, odd, but kind. They took the piss out of her as a family constantly, ‘nosey olga’ they’d call her ‘that nosey bitch’ and other variations. She was a joke to them. I never made those jokes, I felt bad for her. They are group think, they are in many ways hive thinkers. I’m glad I wasn’t a part of that. 

.Here’s another in the same vain. My cousin and other neighborhood kids were, bullying these people…calling them bible bashers. I felt bad for them, so accepted a pamphlet and gave my address out of guilt. I didn’t believe in that stuff back then, but the name calling was shitty. They ended up coming to my door constantly, I didn’t have the heart to tell them to go away, or stop coming. My nanna or grands ended up telling them off. Yeah. One more thing I guess. 

.I used to have bad dreams a lot as a kid. I’d go in to my grandparents room, and use my grandad jeans as a blanket. Because that’s all there was. On the floor. It was shit, but I was too scared to go back in my room. 

.I remember as a kid, constantly asking when my name was called from downstairs ‘am I in trouble?’ Sometimes this would be laughed off, ‘no of course you’re not son’. Sometimes it would ‘why? Should you be?’. 

.My nanna really loved me. And I took it all out on her the worst. I’m still not in the forgiving myself fully part of that yet, it hurts. She’s surprise me, sometimes I thought I was in trouble, and it was actually a nice thing. A surprise. We’re going ‘on holiday’ to see my dad, or a disco ball, that makes me want to cry for some reason. It’s all fucked up.

My aunt once, when my nanna was terminal, came to see me. She said, it having never occurred to me, ‘it’s not your fault nanna has cancer, you can’t give someone cancer’. Which felt, wrong at the time, but I now see she was projecting blame on to me, and frankly, meant to make me feel as though I had. 

.I am just writing, I was kicked out of sixth form, because I got in to a fight with someone who was both homophobic to me. From year 7 said I sounded like I had a gay voice, ran like a gay boy, my ass shook when I ran, and lots of others stuff.  Nobody’s that irrationally without being in the closet. Besides, why look at my ass? lol. 

The point of that was. When K (golden child) was kicked out of sixth form, there was no screaming, yelling, told they’d destroyed their future. When I was? Lizzard stormed around, and said all of this, and we had our whole debacle, and regular occurrence. Basically told I’d amount to nothing. This is the first time I called her a narcissistic, something she later tried to throw back at me, but I’m not the one who set up the dynamic, I just lived in it. 

I will note, I saw a therapist briefly in maryport. Because I was in fact, as I have done throughout my life, tried to get mental health treatment. K, was brought up, nothing malicious, I didn’t blame her for anything, it was innocuous. But the therapist said ‘so K is the golden child is she?’ I’ll add that, in regards to my aunt, he said ‘go no contact. Get as far away from her as you can, and stay away’. I brought up my grandad, he reiterated ‘nope, just stay away from her’. I had brought up, as a kid, how I’d freeze in fear, how as a teenager, I’d shake uncontrollably. I’m far from there now, far. I see her as…a joke, why was I so scared? 

When I would communicate in my limited capacity as a kid, that I was terrified her. How, at single digits she’s scream in my face, spit on my face when she shouted, and point her sharp nails in my face. My grandparents joked, ‘aunt Liz and her scary nails’. It wasn’t a joke. It was abuse, and they enabled that, they never stepped in, said that’s enough. 

If social services had seen, she may well have been arrested, especially in this day and age. 

 A thing that’s funny to me, is this. She said that growing up she was scared of me? A single digits child, with no violent tendencies, who social services saw as happy and developing. The only instance of violence were done to myself, such as hitting my head off walls, which the therapist noted, the same one from maryport, that sounds like a child in distress. She would also, growing up, storm in to my room frequently, flinging the door open. Does that sound like she was ‘frightened?’ No. 

So, when my dad passed, I made the journey down to Cumbria. I can’t tell you how at the time, going outside was impossible for me. I was a nervous wreck, I felt every bit of tension in my face, and running for the train etc. when I got to Cumbria, I got my methylphenidate, which I did abuse, and having not slept the night before my dad’s funeral (I get extremely nervous about any major event, did something stupid, typical). I slept the day, until my dad’s girlfriend rushed in and told me the police were coming to evict me, strange, considering it’s her house, they have no right. This suggests two things, one Toni acted as a pushover, which makes her the victim. Alternatively, they were a player in an episode of emotional abuse they thought was warranted, so I was put next ‘door’ with an alcoholic, a complete stranger, until the alleged police had ‘gone’. I heard my uncle L leave the house, I’m assuming that was ‘the police’ before I was allowed back in. This event came after a previous one. Same scenario, I was told to leave the house, though I had been invited, so Lizabeth and Joan, could arrange the funeral with Toni. I suggested I stay downstairs in the room, of course not, that would make the lizzard uncomfortable. Lizzard basically forced me out of the house, and Toni obliged, and when I called to ask how long it would be as being put in this situation was of great discomfort, Toni spoke to me like absolute shit. 

What’s funny is this, the day before the funeral, L had called me to bitch and moan about Lizzard. Basically saying that she’s manipulative and what not, why put me in that situation I don’t know. Maybe it was a ploy to trick me in to saying something bad, which I neglected to do, or maybe it was genuine. Either way, I think it says bucketloads about the family dynamic. ‘Family’ I should say. 

He also called me on my birthday to say he loved me, half holding back a laugh, me not trusting him was barely able to speak. They see me as a joke, dehumanise me, so they don’t have to acknowledge I was a lighting rod for their abuse, and now their projections. 

Ohhh, I need to add this, because it is quite funny. At my dad’s funeral, Lizzard made an important note to include that my dad was very proud of Katie for being in the police. I kind of scoffed, because my dad didn’t have a single positive thing to say about it, calling Liz etc. hypocrites. When I questioned Toni about it, Toni just shook her head and squinted her eyes like ‘no…’, my dad never brought that up. 

They love to inject themselves, because appearances, above all else, is what matters. Not growing, not unpacking trauma or family dynamics, that. 

The idea that my dad hated me too, repeated by family members, let’s discuss that. Given everything that happened in my childhood, the abuse in my dad and mom’s care, the chaos whenever we would be around, the slapping me when I wanted to go home as I was too cold when camping, the addiction, the in and out of my life, kicking me out of my room, having to call the police on him, and trying to make me pick him over my nanna, causing her to cry. Aren’t I then one that while I do love, am working towards forgiveness? So, yeah. Okay babe, if you say so. 

I’m excited to dig in to Lizzard, L. I mean…find out stuff about where Lizzard used to work, the care home, account, and lee’s criminal history. Also, about how they were growing up. 

I have some accounts. Like Lizzard, had an accident which was clearly a big source of trauma, and that shouldn’t be discounted. But also, that she has been routinely catalogued as a nightmare, in the malicious sense. My mum, for a start. It’s also notable, she has rarely known friends, true long lasting friends, outside the family dynamic. Her ‘friends’ mostly consist of my aunt Joan, and her daughter. That’s a constant. She once said ‘everyone around me gets hurt’, and yet I’ve managed to make connections with people that have lasted years, and despite seeing the worst of me, how ugly I can be, push people away, say the cruelest things, saw someone, at least I hope, that is worth preserving the connection with. 

One thing is, I used to say to her frequently, she shouldn’t be in psychiatric care. KKK clandestine would come to her defence, ‘how would you feel if she made fun of you studying art’ I’d be fine with that first of all, I got my ass to university despite being told it’s a worthless degree, secondly, it’s not the job that’s bad, psycholology is a wonderful profession full of deeply empathetic people, the problem is, she’s not that, that last part. She’s cold, calculated, and so determined of her moral superiority, she can’t understand people objectively.

As a kid, I used to say ‘that’s not fair’ and Lizzard would reduce herself to a child in tone and with a mocking voices ‘that’s not fairrrrrr’. Pure malice. My grandparents would just say ‘life’s not fair’ which, funnily enough, is pretty fair. 

She actually compared me to some bizarre character I’d never heard of until years later. Some…comedy show guy, British TV, pure trash, he starts off as a child and suddenly ‘teenage hood’ hits. But I wasn’t a teenager. Also, it was said with cruelty, dehumanising. Whatever. 

When, I bonded with my ex. She said I ‘only dressed that way because of him’ like no, actually we bonded over gaga fan, the leather, the boots, then tartan trousers were all ways I wanted to dress, but couldn’t afford. I still dress in a similar way, I was so happy when I got my buffalo boots in London, £250. 

She said the tartan were chav trousers, she meant burbary…for someone so obsessed with image and designer this, and trend that, you’d think she knew the name of one of the most famous uk based luxury designers. 

I had an experience in prison where it got incredibly cold, and I heard hooves walking up and down my cell, but vaguely aware of the room. They shouted something and I woke up. Could have sworn I was hypnotised or something.

I know for a fact my family was allowed contact with the prison, to mock me. I explained in full and my therapist Jen said she believed me. I heard them, explicitly, and it never ended since then. It’s been about three and half years. 

No, she believes that my family were allowed access to me inside the prison. They joked about them by name, they routinely paraphrased them, I heard them echoing and having full fledged conversations with them right outside my cell. Inari, this is not fucking dissociation.!

I remember being a kid riding around on my toy bike and playing Pokemon at the same time. Sooty and sweep was still being shown on tv. How the fuck did things get this bad? 

When I first moved to London, I began slipping out of university life almost immediately. I tried to go to class, but between grief for my nanna, tribalism on campus and spending time with people I didn’t really gel with, I started missing weeks at a time. The more I missed, the harder it became to go back.

I met Grant, my first proper boyfriend in London, which turned into a bad situation — cheating, being cheated on, being told I was worthless, that nobody would ever love me, even being called autistic as an insult. It shocked me; I’d imagined people in London would be kinder and more mature.

When my tenancy ended, it ended on the same day I dropped out. Suddenly I had nowhere stable to live. I ended up staying with men I met on apps. They wanted sex; I needed somewhere to sleep. One was an older, aggressive police officer. Another was a bar manager. Then a wealthy man in Vauxhall. Eventually Ryan. It was all a blur.

I tried drugs for the first time (GHB) and felt completely out of control. I didn’t know how to get money. I didn’t think I was entitled to Universal Credit and worried it would stop me going back to university. Out of desperation I signed up to an escorting site. I was taken advantage of more than once. Most of the time I was hungry, living on £1 or £2 a day for couscous or cookies.

I tried a couple of times to get therapy from the university. The staff were kind but the waiting lists were long and the help was minimal. What I really needed was consistent support, not a queue

When my Nanna passed, I was told by Lizard that I was “hammering nails into her coffin” — all because I’d smoked some cannabis. That’s always stuck with me, mostly because it’s ironic: Nanna smoked a joint with us once, while we were all drunk. But, of course, nothing ever applied to Lizard.
I remember saying that Nanna was my mum too — she raised me from the age of two — and Lizard snapped back: “No. She was MY mam.”
Some of the younger kids overheard. They looked horrified. You could tell they saw. The mask slipped, and all of it bled through.

After Nanna died, my grandparents insisted I quit college. I was halfway through my second year and failing badly — not because I didn’t care, but because I was grieving. And I was doing it alone. The only people I could talk to about it were my ex and his mum.
They told me I had to get a full-time job and start paying rent. I refused. We argued. I was told to leave, so I packed my things and left.

Lizard showed up later. Forced her way into the house when my ex’s mum answered the door — Kaz said afterward she had no right to do that, and that she was frightening. Lizard screamed at me from the bottom of the stairs all the way up.
I cried with my ex and his friend that night. I’d thought I’d escaped that environment. But she always found a way to break boundaries — it was textbook for her.

I stayed with my ex for about a year and a half. Slept on a leather fold-out single bed. We weren’t even together anymore by then.
During that time, people encouraged me to apply for housing. I packed a suitcase and went to Workington with my belongings, but was told I’d have to quit college if I wanted to be considered. Even then, I’d just be put on a waiting list.
I couldn’t do that — college was the only path I had. I didn’t even know what university I wanted yet, but I knew that.

Money was tight. Food was tight. I tried to get a job, but couldn’t even afford the work trousers. They told me: “Get the trousers, and you can start.”
I couldn’t. So I started escorting again. I made some decent money — more than I’d ever had before. Sometimes I’d have £100 in my hand, which felt surreal. I kept going.
Eventually, I worked hard and came out with an AAB. Not bad, all things considered. I got into UAL.

I arrived in London with just a suitcase. I went to the university office to get my student ID but was told I needed another form of ID from the bank. So I ran to the bank, only to realise — I had no accommodation.
I navigated the tube for the first time. Got lost. Phone nearly dead. The housing office happened to still be open. I got my first Uber. I arrived at my student halls, completely exhausted.
I looked out the window and saw London.

And I was in awe

It’s just something I remember. Being a kid on bounty avenue, I remember seeing a guy frothing at the mouth, which I now understand was a drug overdose. Right? 

Yep. He was a bully, and his cousins were somehow worse. There was Dylan and Levi, and there was Shannon and some Aaron…just. I got called gay a lot, by Dylan, and one time I tried to run away from being hit by my grands, I wasn’t allowed out of the gate but started running because he was angry, Dylan grabbed me and I got a ‘hiding’ as (my grands would put it). 

Dylan showed me once a mouse in a trap, organs, red. It made me sick, every time I went to eat I’d think about it, especially something with red and kidney bean shaped. 

One time, after being called gay, getting kicked a lot, about 2-3 years older than me Aaron Dylan, I grabbed some flour out of the cupboard, like a lot, threw it over them both, then ran back and hid in the closet up stairs. They came and knocked to ‘grass’ on me, and my grands said I’d been inside all the time, they were trying to get me in trouble, and to fuck off. 

I remember going through a period where my grands called me fat a lot. That was nice. I wasn’t…a big kid. But yeah. I ran a lot, and I biked a lot, until I got older, became a hermit. 

Shouting was pretty much how we resolved conflict in our family. And shouting loud, screaming. I remember once my nanna tried to sit us down, and have a talk, do some exercises that were given to us. The closest thing to therapy we’d tried, my granda mocked my nanna for it, and we never did it again. It failed before it ever took off. 

My granda had moments of softness, he’s not an absolute villain, but neither am I. He would joke a lot, hide toys in corners, and you might not notice them for a long time. When I was little, we played a game where he drew a smiley face in the newspaper, and I had to find it. He did what I called Snow White, where he flipped us, and I imagined it like the scene where she starts to ‘fall’ near the start. 

This is, one of the things. Me and my granda were play fighting, not rough, not out of control. And I said jokingly, laughing ‘shut up granda’…incapable of reading a room, Lizzard started screaming ‘how dare you speak to my dad like that’, cornering me, with no way to move out of the way. Calling me evil, like my dad, yada yada, spitting venom. And I really expected my grands to defend me, he never did. Neither of them ever did. Not where Liz was concerned, the golden child of her own generation, which was somehow still never enough. 

Someone else always had to be ‘beyond help’…in fact, she said of my dad, there isn’t enough medication on earth to help him. Lee was a villain, Lisa was a villain. Always someone a villain. 

I think it’s more complicated than that. My granda had a role to protect me from danger, and she was a danger, psychologically. My granda wasn’t a saint either, and there was many examples of abuse. So, I’m not sugar coating anything in hero villain archetypes. 

The neighbor used to call me chicken shit. When I was like…really young. Like from as early as I can remember until he moved, and some weed growing swingers moved in next door, my nanna befriended the woman. She said she had a chemical imbalance, which was used to justify every behaviour, but never elaborated a diagnosis, or talked about a mental health condition. Maybe it was genuine, maybe some new age way of saying bipolar, I don’t know. 

One memory I have, is still being in a pram, and stealing a parrot beanie baby, I’m sure it was a parrot. I grabbed it from a pile, hid it, and got home. I was terrified of hell, genuinely panic attacks, at least as much as I was able, because it was stealing. So that was fun. My grandparents weren’t vastly religious. My nanna a Protestant, and granda a catholic. They occasionally said ‘oh my god’ was blasphemy, but didn’t go to church. They didn’t make us pray. They didn’t have religious type rules. I later came to find out blasphemy is not literally ‘using the lords name in vain’ as in appropriating it in to a sentence, but using ‘god’s name to commit harmful acts against other people’….idk like televangelists. 

At a particularly low moment, both sleep deprived and hopped up on a large overdose of methylphenidate, I had…sex, with my dad’s girlfriends cousin, which looking back was both ick, and troubling. I was in a horrible place, Ashley. So, he propositioned me a second time, and said he felt insecure because maybe it wasn’t good, and that’s why I didn’t seek ‘for it’ I was like ‘it was fine’, but the truth is I was fucked up. I had taken 50mg x 28 of methylphenidate and was sleep deprived. 

I later told Toni when angry, he denied it ever happened. Also, kind of funny he was being derogatory about me behind my back, snake behaviour. Besides, I need self respect. That was the first time I realised Toni wasn’t always a safe space, and that I didn’t really want to ever go back. This was the night before my father’s funeral. 

Needs to be stated, Liz mocked me for crying, every single time. Not even exaggerating, whenever I was upset, with my situation, or her abuse, she mocked, said I was faking, said they were ‘crocodile tears’ and mocked me, for me at that moment, being single digits, she was basically elderly, in her 40’s almost turning 50 in a few, reducing herself to a caricature of someone my own age. 

I still find myself, stopping myself from crying, like ‘sucking it up’ like I was told, and it feels like so much pressure is built up, in my head, my body. Yup. 

Being called a sissy or pansy a lot as a kid. By Joan, it was…a throw away, a joke, but it does eat in to a kids early sense of their own masculinity. It’s bound to. She didn’t mean it to be malicious, but this is something, growing up gay, you have to contend with. 

I was called soft but that one stuck less. I think it’s just a common thing up north.

Here’s another, I used to get screamed at by Lizzard, for even casually referring to my nanna as she. Always ‘who’s she cats mother’ which is such a fucking stupid expression. Pure poison. My friend brought up why I always say ‘they’, they said they is for multiple people, it was to avoid ‘she’ and ‘he’. I’m glad that’s sort of the norm in the queer community and beyond now. 

To add to that, my ex had to explain why I said they, instead of she. When I was in college. 

I remember my granda making a comment, and I said that it hurt my feelings, he responded ‘you don’t have feelings’ 

One thing about the Lizzard, is that she would always do the most sickly sweet, fake ‘kind’ voice I have ever heard. She would go ‘IYAHHHH LADDDD’ then immediately go back to cold and reading the paper. To everyone of my cousins. It was…like a robot trying to simulate joy. 

Weird my very first memory is either falling, or being pushed from a bunk bed. In care. Kind of fucked up. 

My second memory is walking across the bridge with my nanna and granda (from care) to go home with them for the first time. One either side of me. Idk why, but I remember feeling loved, or happy, or both. I had a box of cars, and I think lion king teddy, one where mufasa has simba in his mouth, detachable by Velcro (why was there so much Velcro in the 90’s), and some chocolates shaped by lion king characters I think, almost Easter eggs, but I’m not sure if they were lion king related. 

This early memories of my granda, there’s a lot of love…like a lot of it. My nanna and granda used to bring the other kids sweets when they came to see me, they didn’t want to leave them out, and also weren’t allowed. (I was in care) 

My nanna cut her platte off when I was a kid, it made me sad, she kept it in a drawer, never getting rid of it. It was her signature, still makes me slightly sad. 

One time, I was at a wedding. S and my uncle M’s. I was dancing, in a kilt. A woman lifted my kilt up, I was mortified, so I grabbed a can of coke and threw it over her. I got told off for that…like a lot. But my nanna later joked about it. One tradition they had was to throw coins everywhere, I had a pouch with my kilt, and made bank that day. At least for me being little. People kept putting money in the pouch afterwards also. people were putting notes in the pouch, I have no idea where that money went. Maybe towards my game boy, maybe to hold the house afloat, either way. It’s nice. I was really shy. I was a very shy kid. Kind of been shy most of my life. 

When I had sex unprotected, the one or two times I panickedly went to the clinic in soho, talked with my friend T, and he said ‘if you get the meds you won’t get HIV you silly mare’.  I always took the medication. When i did ‘sex work’ I was strictly protection, no exceptions, I wouldn’t even kiss. 

I said to Jen once, I come to therapy because I want to know what’s wrong with me, we had many session at this point, but I hadn’t been diagnosed. The thing is, therapists know when you’re being full of shit, and Jen is cool, she’ll call you out on it, I went in knowing that full well, this isn’t play time for me, it’s healing. So Jen responded ‘there’s nothing WRONG with you Ollie, then went on to explain how trauma is the largest component of mental health’. Labelling someone ‘evil’ or ‘crazy’ is such a transparent way to cover your own ass.. 

When Lizzard lied about the knife, about kicking my nanna. She’s showed Toni a post I made, on Facebook, over ten years old. It was sent to her by my grandparents next door neighbor, which is funny because liked it. 10 years. I brought it up to Jen saying it was weird, Jen looked shocked and said ‘you’re right, that is weird’. Oh! Yeah. Context. She was on the way to my dad’s funeral. Toni said she thinks I want forgiveness, then she said ‘never’ and lied about those two things. I don’t need to be forgiven by her, I wouldn’t accept it if she gave it, because I’ll never forgive her. She can do one, I may not have the ‘mob’, but I do have integrity. 

You know what’s funny? I am pretty sure in the post I said I’d never forgive her. Maybe that’s what triggered her to it? 

Also, pretty sure she weaponised throw away last minute ‘art’ I did at college scrabbling enough just to get a grade. Photographed it. Like…a lizard, collecting trinkets to weaponise later? Who thinks like that? That’s crazzzzzzy behaviour. 

Speaking of that, I know my grandparents meant well, but when I was super little and upset, they’d lock me in my room. I had footballs on the carpet, is was red. I don’t remember the bed so much, and I used to hit my head of the wall. After care, I know their intention was good, truly good, they were giving me a time out, I guess. But…I needed idk. I think I was angry with myself. Or frustrated like the therapist said, I don’t know.

‘Nobody survives him’ is another thing Lizzard said. Implying my nanna and granda died because of me, at least, that’s what it felt like. But that’s an interpretation, not a factual recollection. Which is funny, because…my ex? Thriving, all of them. My friends love me, for me. I just don’t want to be, involved with ‘them’. 

It’s always been strange to me, that of a family of four children she was the golden child, and only one that didn’t turn to drugs and crime. Can’t fault her for that, but it is weird. She also gave my nanna the silent treatment when they would argue, cut contact, until my nanna made things right. K would still come around, though I’m pretty sure she had a go at K for coming around one time. 

Lee/george said to me. ‘After everything we’ve done for you’…I’m sorry but once nanna died I navigated life alone, the training wheels were off. I fucked up massively, but idk, I’m trying to grow now. They haven’t…they’re making out like the moved continents for me. I will say, Kelly and Lee let me stay in theirs for a couple of weeks, and I felt safe, like genuinely kind gesture. They also, got me a place at generator, for 4 days or so. But…that statement…is so out of touch with reality. So I’m not supposed to air my grievances, when yours with me are very public, just shut my mouth? Nah, because for years they’ve been flattening me, berating me, making me a joke a monstrous caricature, and I’m supposed to say thank you? 

I got through college, despite everything alone. I came to London, alone. I supported myself, alone. I got a job and worked, alone. I survived, alone. I don’t owe any of them anything, and I’m not gonna pretend I do. I’m grateful, kind of, but considering I paid that debt off in emotional abuse, no.

She emphasized her  concern for me, but it wasn't until I told her one thing in particular that she brought up CPS.

I'm gonna get an MRI sometime this week just to confirm the doctor’s belief that I have a stress fracture.

1o0tob4,"Adoptive nDads ""dying wish""","Hey everyone. Haven't posted in a while. I apologize if this is jumbled.

I went no contact with my adoptive parents in 2023. I have seen them twice on technicality since, first at a funeral and then when I needed my car title signed over. But since having the car title signed over, I have had absolutely no reason or desire to see them again. I actually have more reason to be angry at them now than before I went no contact because I found out that my adoption was open in the beginning and then they cut my biological family off without warning. My bio mom died before I could meet her, but she could have been in my life all along.

No one from my adoptive family has my phone number, though they do know where I live. Some of them do have my fiance's phone number.

Last week, my fiance walked into the room with this ""you're not gonna believe this shit"" look on his face. He said that my aunt called and left a message and was asking that I call her back. I knew instantly  that this was a flying monkey call. She was calling to tell me something was wrong with one of my adoptive parents.

And I was right. Adoptive Dad had surgery and it didnt go well. The doctors want to do another surgery but he doesn't and is basically giving up. He expressed to my aunt that he wanted to be able to talk to me one last time, so she wanted to be the messenger to let me know all of this. I told her thanks for letting me know and ended the call.

I also want to note that I went through something like this right before I went no contact. He was having similar issues, and a similar surgery. They were always very vague about what information they would tell me and made it out like he was dying. They used it to try to get me to visit more often. So in addition to the standard feelings, I don't know if this is manipulation.

I have gone through an emotional roller-coaster this past week. The first couple of days were anger, and guilt, and sadness. I had to leave work early the day after and take a mental health day. I made an emergency appointment with my therapist. I reached out to my best friend who I hadn't actually talked to in over a year and cried to her.  

Between my therapist, my best friend, and my fiance, everyone was saying they would support whatever decision I made, but they were all trying to remain neutral because I was saying I didn't know what to do. A friend/coworker definitely chose more of a side when he said outright ""Fuck em, you don't owe them anything."" That helped, and I definitely think it's what I wanted to hear. 

I have officially decided that I am not reaching out, and now I have to sit with that for however long my brain needs to. Trying to tell myself that I don't owe anyone an explanation for why (yes, I realize that this whole post is one giant explanation, but y'all are different). Thanks for reading. 

Tl;dr: My adoptive dad might be dying and I'm preserving my peace by not granting his dying wish of seeing me or talking to me one last time.

1o0sn5e,I’ve stopped cleaning her room.,"I’m not sure I’ll make a lot of sense because of my current headspace…It feels like a pathetic triumph but she conditioned me to believe it’s my duty to do every single thing for her and put her needs above mine. 

I work full time and she still expects me to do all of the cleaning and most of the cooking in our flat. Over the last month, I’ve at least stopped cleaning her room. What I used to do weekly/fortnightly for her bedroom:
- vacuum
- dust and disinfect all surfaces
- change and wash bedding
- all laundry, including folding and putting away
- organising her cupboards and throwing out anything old/broken

She waited 2 weeks before finally putting a load of laundry in and I still had to put her clothes in the dryer so I could wash mine. Whenever I’m cleaning my own stuff, she makes comments about how selfish I’m being by not spending time with her or how her room is dusty so how dare I clean mine first. 

There’s a constant tension in air and I know she’s waiting for me to cave in, and I probably will. My friend wanted to come over but the flat is a mess and I’m too burnt out to clean it. She’s invited some family friends to stay over the weekend and I know she’s expecting me to clean and get beds ready for the guests.

1o0r4yk,Grew up with a narcissistic parent and now realize the other one might be narcissistic as well,"I need help with understanding my mother's behavior

Firstly, my father was really controlling (he was the narcissistic and the abusive parent growing up) and i grew up in a household where everything had to be done with his permission, even for breathing we had to ask for permission

Now my parents are divorced for 4 years now and they've been living separately since 11 years. Ive been living with my mother since they separated. Im 26 now but still live with her. Rent was too high also in our culture it's normal to live with parents so it was convenient for both parties.

Anyways back to my mother. My mother always acted like she was the angel compared to my father, and i believed her.

But something happened today, well actually this behavior isn't new but something made me realize things aren't normal. My mother always tells us that we should communicate with her (she says should and not must like my father used to) saying it's for our safety and always tells me a story of a relative who was found dead in an hotel room and police couldn't find the culprit because his family had no idea who his friends were. So my mother keeps telling me that we should communicate, that we are adults now as im 26 so i don't have to ask for permission but i should communicate with her about what im doing.

But today something flipped in me. I drove to a city that is 4 hours away because i had an appointment. When hearing that im going there my aunt gave me a package and told me to deliver it to a little town next to that city. Somehow i thought that a cousin of mine was living in that town so i contacted him, apparently he was living in another town. The plan was I'd go to the city (let's just call it A), go to that little town, deliver the package, meet with the cousin in city A then get back to where i live.

But plans changed. I arrived early so i delivered the package first. Because i delivered the package first, my cousin couldn't arrive in time to city A so he told me i can meet him in another city (let's call it city D) next to city A so i got on the road. On my way there my mother called me asking me what i was doing and i told her im on my way to meet with cousin. She straight up told me off (passively and ""kindly"" and hiding her anger like she always does) saying there's basically no reason to meet with him and that i should turn back. Then milliseconds later she said if i want i can meet with him but added that this wasn't the original plan.

I arrived there and learned that my cousin informed my uncle of my arrival so they of course invited me for dinner.

I just had my dinner and my mother called me. She got really angry at me but she is expert at hiding her anger and showing her anger passively and she told me i should've contacted her, that the problem isn't that im at my uncle's but rather that i haven't contacted her/communicated with her

Excuse my english but i feel like she's as controlling as my father she's just expert at hiding it and manipulating other people thinking she's actually the good one here

1o0qyef,"""I'm so proud of you!""","It's the phrase I always wanted to hear as a child, but never did. I remember having to ask my Nmom if she was proud of me, because she just... never said it. The only time she really did was the night before I moved out and went NC. It was part of a larger campaign: threaten to throw away family heirlooms, talk about how ""scary"" my destination city is (it's amazing and moving out here was the best decision of my life, hands down), offering money and assistance (to be used as a bargaining chip)...

But I still remember, starkly, that that was the night she told me multiple times, unprompted, that she was proud of me. She knew I'd wanted to hear that. She knew that was something important to me. And she used it as a bargaining chip, like an ace up her sleeve. 

I read somewhere about children of abuse growing up to be the people that they needed when they were younger, and I internalized that. I like to tell my friends all the time about how proud I am of them, and how wonderful they've made my life. 

To you, reading this on the raisedbynarcissists sub, I know how hard of a journey it's been. Navigating life without supportive parents. Learning how to grow up on your own.

1o0qply,My mum’s response to ‘I can’t pet sit’ was to torch our relationship and threaten legal action,"Throwaway account. I (34M) went no-contact with my mum last month after years of being treated like her unpaid staff/ATM/therapist. This year it all came to a head.

TL;DR: Said no to unpaid pet-sitting 12 animal ‘farm’ on multiple occasions because I had minor things like court duty supporting a traumatised friend or other life stuff. Mum ignored, then harassed, triangulated, love-bombed, went nuclear with flying monkeys, blocked me everywhere, and is now threatening legal action over a phone bill in her name. Relationship’s not strained, it’s dead.

None TL;DR: Alright, context time. 

For years, I’ve been her unpaid pet sitter, especially when I lived at home (I live with my partner now). We’re talking all times of the year, including my birthday or Christmas. 12 pets (4 dogs, 8 cats). She also held my phone number, despite years of trying to get this into my name, it was always never a good time. I tolerated this because I had been effectively conditioned to be the pliable “good son”, and I’d been the victim of splitting, isolation tactics and more from her before. The stuff I could go into…

She first demanded this year I pet-sit in July for 10 days around my birthday (surprise). I said for the first time ever I wasn’t sure, as I was a court witness for a traumatised friend, and my availability wasn’t clear (you’d think your son being in court would be a moment of understanding, but nah). She ignored that, triangulated my partner to pressure me, minimised court duty (and she literally said she had always wanted to be in court “like Law and Order”…christ, read the room) and treated it as confirmed anyway. 

When I held the line, she “cancelled” (framed as a noble sacrifice), then came back a week later bargaining me down to “just a few days” and spamming me with cat photos as guilt bait. I still said no, I still had court to attend. She went on holiday anyway, clearly had alternatives, and never once checked in during my court week. Cool. 

While this was going on, she casually dropped a second demand: I’d be pet-sitting in December too. No dates, no details, just “you’ll do it.” That’s fair, I’ll just block out an entire calendar month I guess 🙃 After patterns of ignoring me for weeks on end and more guilt tripping, by September she was pressuring me hard: “I need an answer now.” I replied: if you need an answer now, I can’t commit. She later twisted this into me having agreed “in principle.” 

Then came the harassment: repeated texts, copy-paste messages, calls, testing drop-ins, cross-platform spam, dragging my partner in again. When I finally drew a hard boundary (“I’m not available in December, stop contacting me about this”), she ignored it, went into an extinction burst (13 calls in one evening, guilt-tripping love-bombs), and then escalated further by getting my sister and other family members to block me (misery loves company I guess). She then pulled the classic martyr routine, told me it was my loss for “treating her this way” and blocked me too. 

I’d had it, so: new number, cancelled the standing order I’d been sending her for the phone account in her name, and told her plainly: do not contact me outside of genuine emergencies, in writing only. I told her any issues with the phone number in her name was her responsibility. 

She waited a week and half and then breached that boundary too, an email threatening solicitors if I don’t pay off her phone contract balance came through today. The account has always been in her name; I only ever transferred money to her account while I used the number. It’s her liability, but she’s now trying to scare me with legal action. My mother, ladies and gentlemen!

That’s where we are. From guilt-bait over unpaid pet-sitting, to harassment and triangulation, to smear campaigns, to financial threats. I’ve never escalated. She has, every step of the way.

The relationship is dead. She’s proven her “love” was conditional and transactional. She’s not just boundary-stomping anymore, she’s in full destroy mode, leaving me to pick up the pieces. My partner is utterly aghast at the situation, and can’t comprehend how vile my mother has been. 

I’ve wondered if I should post this here, but I think it’s probably best to see what others who have survived this and worse might have to say. There’s more to the story (when isn’t there), but I’ve tried to be as succinct as I can. I’m somewhere between “yeah this checks out”, incredulous, and livid, but it’s wild to me how quickly it went from syrupy guilt bait to legal threats, but here we are.

1o0p5ck,I lost everyone by cutting him off,"I (29 F) have been no contact from my nfather for a little over a year now. To summarize, he is a textbook narcissist that mentally, verbally, physically, and borderline sexually abused me (grooming tactics, would walk around naked). I got to a point last year where I simply couldn’t take it anymore. I was so tired of all the mental gymnastics 24/7, feeling like I was under his thumb at all times, etc. I’ve been in therapy since I was 17 with the same therapist, so it’s been over a decade of trying to heal from the abuse while still seeing my abuser on the daily… surprise: it just doesn’t work like that. 

I recently got married a few months ago, so naturally, my father was not invited to the wedding. Most of the people in my life were very understanding, since he’s shown so many people his true colors at this point. He’s tried to reach out multiple times, and you could imagine what those emails/letters said… it’s all the same as what anyone else shares on here. Never a true apology, zero accountability for what he’s done/caused. 

My estrangement caused a major riff between my grandparents and I. My grandmother does have some narcissistic tendencies, definitely not on the same level as my father, but it’s easy to see where he got it from. My grandparents are getting older and older, I continuously try to maintain a relationship with them, but it seems like they really don’t want much to do with me unless I reconcile with my father. I have so much grief and guilt. 

On top of this, my younger brother has been slowly distancing himself from me since the estrangement. He’s always said that he “understands” why I did what I did, but that I “have no idea the pain that I’ve caused,” particularly with my grandparents. As far as I know, my brother experienced the same amount of abuse, minus the SA, but still continues to defend my father. My brother did end up attending our wedding, but things just aren’t the same. I was really hoping, if nothing else, that me and my brothers relationship wouldn’t change… since growing up in that house, all we had was each other. But he also seems to want nothing to do with me, and also seems to be picking up a lot of our father’s habits and characteristics. 

I often get so anxious and so depressed just thinking about the family that I lost. Sometimes I start to think that maybe I am the problem after all…. It’s such a conflicting feeling that I can’t even put to words. Sometimes I think, - well I can’t be that horrible of a person, I have friends that are like family to me… I have cousins, aunts, and uncles that I’m close with… I feel like I care about everyone and make an effort to be in my people’s lives - But other times, I just feel plagued with shame and guilt, and I believe that maybe I am something awful that my grandparents and brother don’t want to be around. 

Can anyone share some insight? Is this a common thing to feel?

1o0ow3w,Does Anyone Else Think The Don't Deserve Good Things?,"This is an active self-sabotage behavior I am trying so hard to break. I don't even talk to my therapist about this one, since I don't think he gets it. 

For context, I went no contact with my family, sold a lot of what I owned from the enmeshed situation I was living in, and then as I re-furnished my new apartment, started buying new things. A wobbly (new) desk that I absolutely hate and makes me uncomfortable to sit at, a stained bookshelf, and an antique dresser whos drawers don't open and the wheels stick. 

Then, since I couldn't fix the antique dresser, I bought a second one off Marketplace for $60 thinking I could staple the drawers and fix it. But once it was delivered by the woman selling it, I realized there was no fixing this thing, and I've just been using a busted dresser for 6 months, which pisses me off every time I use it because I think of how stupid I was to purchase garbage, basically. And I don't have a real support system for anyone to even help me haul the stupid thing to my apartment's trash - or to help me get a new one. 

For me, I think it stems from both of my parents encouraging me to follow my dreams - and then being incredibly critical and humiliating to me when I actually tried to do something. Write, perform, try out for a sports team. Anything.

1o0ov7y,Narcissist using narcissistic abuse terms and using them incorrectly,"My narcissistic sister often uses the narcissistic abuse lingo like gaslighting, love bombing, projection… I can confidently say she uses them incorrectly pretty much all the time.

The craziest one was “you are projecting the old me on to new me, I am no longer that person” after I asked her to take accountability about something she did 3 weeks prior.

She is struggling in her marriage and says that her spouse is love bombing her, he is trying for few days and then not trying as much. My understanding of love bombing is going out of character and bombing someone with love to control them which is not what she is describing at all.

I try to tell her that these terms carry heavy meanings and her situation doesn’t seem to match up, she is using the terms incorrectly. She tells me I am invalidating her and sometimes tells me I am gaslighting her… because I did not agree with her.

1o0oew3,Help : Trapped by my parents in Russia,"Help : Trapped by my parents in Russia

Thank you for taking the time to read and sorry if I make mistakes, my english can be bad
So for the context : I am a 19 year old french girl, my father is french and my mother is russian, both of my parents are very very toxic and abusive and since childhood I suffered emotional and physical abuse from them
Every year, me and my mother went to her hometown in Russia to visit our family during school holidays and then came back to France. But when we went to Russia in august 2024 (I was still only 17 and that same month I turned 18)
Suddenly out of nowhere my mother tells me that we will stay in Russia for an entire year !!!!
I was completely shocked !!!! I told her I don't want to, I called my father who was in France and I begged him to pay me a plane ticket to return (via Turkey for example), but he said NO. So basically I am major, I am supposed to be finally free form my parents (and actually my plans when back in France, were to move out and work to finally be free from my parents) but I find myself stuck in Russia (a foreign country for me) with no money, no social security, with nothing, so basically : I lost my freedom, I am forced by circumstances to live with my mother, I am literally TRAPPED (I have all the reasons to think my parents did this on purpose because, they don't want me to go away from them, they want to keep the control on me, they're completely crazy)
During the year I have tried to earn money by giving english lessons to russian kids, but I didn't find a better earning job like for exemple :  waiter or cashier because my russian is not good as I have lived my entire life in France and I don't have all the official documents to work legally. And all the little amount of money I managed to earn went to buy clothes for the harsh russian winter, I didn't have the choice.
One year later I am now 19, I lost an entire year of my life trying to survive, I am still here in Russia, my parents don't want to give me money to return, and I just feel like I can't do it anymore, I am stuck in a country where I have no future, no purpose, I have no chances to escape, I desperately want to return to my country that I miss so much (I am litteraly crying while writing this), I want to be FREE
I did some research, I found the website of the French consulate in Russia. It was written that the French government does not help french citizens in complicated situations to be repatriated to France. And I have no one to help me (I lost the contacts of my french family and friends)
My mother abuse me verbally and physically regularly, it's only getting worse everyday, she controls everything in my life, EVERYTHING, I have no freedom at all, I suffer a lot

1o0n4qt,“Oh that doesn’t count as coercive control.”,"Semi-follow rant up to previous rant: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/s/2gL646adlQ

While trying to get help filing temp restraining orders against my partner’s abusive parents, I was asked questions concerning my situation. One of those was regarding coercive control. 

Because my (sort of) in-laws are friends with our landlord, they regularly made threats with this in mind. Such as: “You only have a place because of MY friend” or “You’re asking favors of ME keep that in mind” in reference to housing. 

I am a disabled full time college student and my partner is the only one who can work (we didn’t have a car at the time), so his mother would also deny transportation to my doctors appointments or his work regularly to get us to comply with “how she ruled the house”. (Which was essentially her not letting us have any space at all though we paid half the rent)

Not only that but when my partner got a temp restraining orders put on both his parents, immediately after we got a notice to vacate from our landlord. 

My therapist AND psychiatrist who I’ve told these events to have both said that’s classic coercive control. But idk, because his parents don’t own the house directly and we don’t have a contract with them it doesn’t count? Make it make sense.

It's hard to even use the word ""abuse"" because I've been told all my life that this behavior is not only normal, but it's actually good for me, and that I just don't understand because I'm still a kid. I'm still being told this now at age 29. I've had to translate, negotiate bills, buy and sell items on Craigslist, negotiate with telemarketers, and resolve account issues for almost all bills and services for my dad since I was 9 years old. And then when I inevitably screw up, or break down from the stress (because i was 9 years old), I am told I am incompetent, and that I am being ungrateful because this is how I should be repaying him for his kindness of giving me food and shelter. This has been ongoing for 20 years. He has done this with the intention of training me to become a tool that would be most useful for him. At the same time though, my dad continues to treat me like a child. Invades my private spaces, digs through my stuff, throws away my personal items, tries to control how I spend the money that I earn from my job, tries to control what/when/how fast I eat food, and monitors my location every single day. He has told me directly that I should be grateful for this behavior because I'm not ""capable of taking care of myself"" at 29 years old, when in reality, I'm living with him because he's very elderly and cannot speak English or drive. I have had significant long term mental health issues because of this, but I had always believed that it's simply because I am weak minded or too sensitive. I've always known he was a narcissist but I guess I just always thought it was my own fault I turned out this way.

1o0kpl7,Going on trip with covertly incestuous Nmom,"Hi all,

Heads up for possible sexual abuse.

My mom has recently ramped up the amount of sexually inappropriate comments she makes at me, like constantly bringing up sex or talking about my body (I was in the car awhile back with her when she said I have ""really nice breasts"" while looking and smiling at them like a perverted creep.) A couple of weeks ago, she started undressing right in front of me as soon as she walked through my door. I was on the phone with her this morning talking about my skin problems and she told me I ""have to have sex"" in order to clear up my skin. wtf She has always been very touchy-feely with me, caressing my legs or shoulders, and wanting to sleep next to me even now as I'm an adult. She'd go into my room, just to tell me something innocuous like what I want for breakfast, while being completely naked. She's called me sexy. She's kissed me on the mouth several times. I was underage and she would be buying me thongs and enjoy telling me how ""sex is great"", ""nothing is wrong with prostitution"", etc. When I'm walking up the stairs in front of her or even just standing around in public, she likes to suddenly pinch my butt because apparently she finds it funny. She also finds it funny to suddenly lift under my shirt or pants and ""peek"" under there so she can make fun of my body hair. She's made fun of me for ""having no tits and no ass"" when I was still just a child. Anytime she goes to the bathroom, she starts making moaning VERY loudly for some reason. Moans that sound so sexual, it's like someone is having sex with her in there. She's done this even with other family members around. I feel crazy that I'm the only one who seems to have noticed that or cared. I've never heard of anyone else sounding like they're in porn like that every single time they go number one or number two, lmfao. What kind of person loudly goes ""MMMMMMM"" and ""OOOOOOH"" every single time they pee or poo?

She would do this weird thing where she would make do jumping jacks in front of her, after commenting on my body, but I feel like it was again to just embarrass/humiliate me and/or sexually harass me. Might be a complete coincidence, but given all of the other stuff, I also find it weird that her favorite curse word of choice around me seems to be ""Motherfucker"" and favorite saying is ""Fuck your mother!"" when cursing around me.

I know for a fact she likes younger people. She's had a long-distance boyfriend that was almost my brother's age. It was while I was underage and she even once tried to secretly have cybersex with him  while I was in the room next to her.

I've always thought she's messed up in the head, but don't think she is messed up enough to actually molest me or anything. It may be moreso her taking enjoyment from making me uncomfortable and trying to re-assert her control over me rather than having a sexual attraction to me. I think she also keeps pushing the subject of sex onto me because since she's getting older now, she is getting more desperate to have grandchildren. I'm not planning on having children and it looks like neither is my brother.

I still definitely feel increasingly uncomfortable around her. It leaves me with such an ""ick"" that I want to throw up. She is way too comfortable doing all these pseudo-incestuous things around me. I'm especially worried because I'm supposed to be going on a trip with her in a few weeks and I feel uncomfortable with being alone with her. However, I think it's too late for me to cancel because she will never give me the money back that I paid for my share of  the hotel and transportation, raise a giant fuss (She will 100000% refuse to go alone), and I don't feel comfortable walking back on PTO I already requested with my boss. I did also want to go on this trip, though... Is there any way I can go and still keep myself safe around her, if at all?

tl;dr Nmom has always made a bunch of weird and inappropriate sexual comments and actions toward me my whole life. Recently feels like it has gotten worse. I'm going to be alone with her on vacation soon so I am concerned about that.",raisedbycysts,1759856921.0,87,0.96,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o0kpl7/going_on_trip_with_covertly_incestuous_nmom/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o0kpl7/going_on_trip_with_covertly_incestuous_nmom/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o0k05t,I've become such an asshole kid...,"Mainly just a rant post, but it had me thinking 

Since about 2 years ago my nmother has been up my ass about my boyfriend and his family. I started staying over at his place for weekends or longer, but apparently to her I'm a reckless wild child that is running off to a dangerous family who's apparently trying to manipulate me to get at my nmother. Mind you, I'm 22 with a job and going to school, but even with all the evidence of what I'm doing and openness on what I'm doing. But every time I get home its always the same spiel of his family and him, or how I'm some idiot who cant think for themselves, or that I'm just a whre/slt who only has d on their mind...

But since the start of these comments about me or my man, I'm been either questioning all her accusations or false statements. Recently I'll wake up and try to get something to eat and she immediately starts questioning me on my bf's family and then calling them criminals (she's literally never even met them, and no they're not). I'll tell her to back off, its way too early for this type of bother. And then she tells me how I can't say or do shit since I'm just the child and she's the parent. She also says how I can't act all high and mighty because I don't pay for anything in the house, but I LITERALLY pay more bills for the house than she does. (She literally doesn't work, all she does is smoke, is noisy even when people are trying to sleep, not clean, rarely ever cooks, and is so fucking rude to me and my dad. still has the audacity to ask us to buy her cigs tho...)",wizxarddix,1759855434.0,2,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o0k05t/ive_become_such_an_asshole_kid/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o0k05t/ive_become_such_an_asshole_kid/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o0jyxj,Advice on toxic mom,"This is going to be a bit long, but I need to add context first... I have never really been close to my mom because of who she is as a person. She had me young, at 19. I have two younger siblings in their early 30's. I am in my late 30's. She's an alcoholic, has always been pretty immature, never takes accountability for her actions, loves drama. She is toxic. When I was in my late teens, my mom started to drink beer pretty heavily. She's about 58 now and that hasn't slowed down. The alcohol pushed me away from her further, and we got into some bad fights. She can be extremely nasty when she's drunk and she loves to fight with people. When I started dating my now-husband, my mom seemed jealous of my happiness and would constantly look for a problem with him. More than a few times, we've left my parent's house upset after having a fight with her. She always oversteps. She tried to sabotage my wedding day. She cracked a beer open before I even walked down the aisle, then once the ceremony ended, my mom was off drinking with her friends the remainder of the day. I barely saw her, until later on, when she caused a scene and my brother had to drag her off home. She refused to apologize after and was pissed at my husband for yelling at her. 

Fast forward to five years later, my dad passed away suddenly from a brain aneurysm in May 2021. My dad and I were super close, and it was the most devastating loss of my life. After he passed, my mom was a walking disaster. She sold my parents' house very quickly in September 2021, then moved into my grandma's house. Throughout the grieving of my dad, it was me constantly picking up the pieces, all the messes my mom was making. She managed to push my brother away to the point where he doesn't speak to any of my family anymore, including me. She pushed my sister away for three years (but though she came back into our lives recently). I literally didn't get a chance to grieve myself, because of all the havoc she wreaked.

To get to the point, my mom has been dating random men for the past few years. They have all been bad. One conned her into leasing an apartment in her name, where she bought all new furniture for every room. He was verbally abuse and controlling - he had her cutting/coloring her hair his specific way and dressing a specific way he wanted. At that time, we were not talking, because I did not support her. This ended after about three months where he threatened her with a butter knife in their kitchen, and the police arrested him. After that relationship failure, she went on a few more dates with random guys, then found her most recent boyfriend, John. She's been with him for about two years. He seems decent enough. But he drinks vodka regularly, so her drinking is not getting any better. I heard from my grandma that they'd get drunk a lot and then fight. My mom continously told me how bad she wanted me to meet him, always dropping hints, but whenever I was home visiting, she made sure he didn't come over. I found out through my grandma that John is a huge Trump supporter, and he would often get into heated arguments with my grandma, who despises Trump. John is a big enough Trump supporter that he's influenced my mom, basically brainwashing her. This is ultimately why I have hesitated for so long to meet John, because his values do not align with my own. Also, my husband is Asian and he is extremely uncomfortable with meeting this man. Throughout dating him, my mom has ambushed me with him when we're talking on the phone - John will randomly start talking to me, even though she doesn't inform me he's even there. It's annoying and intrusive, especially when I don't even know he's there. It's made me feel even more distant with my mom, because I don't want to talk to her on the phone if she's just going to keep forcing us to somehow communicate, even though we haven't met. 

At the beginning of September, I was visiting home. I live in New Jersey, my family lives about 5 1/2 hours away in NY. It was a nerve wracking trip because I was going to see my sister, her fiance, and my niece after us not speaking for almost three years. While that went wonderfully, we picked up right where we left off, my mom had a plan that I was unaware of. While my husband was forced to prepare dinner for seven of us (thanks, mom), in walks John. My husband was cleaning raw chicken, and he tried to come in and first greet my husband, then me. My mom was sitting next to me like nothing was wrong with the situation. I was flabbergasted - I felt like I was backed into a corner. I said hi really quick, then turned to my mom and said ""Really mom?? Really??"" Then I walked out of the house. My husband berated her for doing that to me, then my mom quickly spiraled, crying and causing a scene. When she freaks out like this, my grandma immeadiately freaks out too, because she always gives in to the toxicity. It's hard for my grandma because she isn't able-bodied, so she relies on my mom for everything. My mom was trying to say that it's unfair my sister can have her fiance, I can have my husband, but she can't be happy too. It was incredibly selfish of her to act like this, turning everything around on me like I'm the asshole. John left for about an hour, then came back and they just hung out in the backyard until I left. For the remainder of my time at home, I barely spoke to her, but I still hugged her goodbye before going back home. After that, I didn't hear from her until the day of my wedding anniversary, which was a week later. She tried to act like nothing was wrong between us, not taking an accountability for upsetting me. I had to call her out - I had enough. I let all of my feelings out there on the line. I told her I am happy for her, but she can't force me to meet her boyfriend, putting me on the spot and making me look like an asshole. She freaked out, saying she's allowed to be happy, that she's sorry I don't want to get to know him. She asked me how I'd feel if she told me I had to leave my husband at home when I visited. Then she told me John was extremely hurt by the way he was treated and so was she. Then she played the pity card saying ""you try living alone and see how life is... not fun and it hurts me that you won't allow him in your life... I think it's very childish. It's not like dad and I divorced. He is gone!!!! And I miss him!!! John is extremely nice and very helpful to grandma and me so I will not apologize that he stopped over to get something from me. You have Jack. Let me be happy. That is all I ask. Have a great day! Love you!"" I flipped. I told her she can't just brush everything under the rug and to take responsibility for being a shitty parent. That she always plays the manipulative toxic victim and that I'm over it. That she lives the same life day in, day out, never trying to fix her drinking or fix anything else in her life. I told her I always push my feelings aside to avoid conflict but that I'm over that. That she makes it really hard for me to love her. That she's put me through so much trauma in the past few years. I told her I never said I didn't want her to be with someone, that I'm happy she's with someone that makes her happy. But that she can't ambush me. I told her unfortunately his politics are shit. He has a gay son, but yet he supports a man that wants to take away gay rights. That he supports a man that doesn't give a shit about POC or women. I reminded her that she has a Black (almost) son-in-law, a half-Black granddaughter, and an Asian son-in-law. I told her I didn't want to be around someone that feeds my mother bullshit and starts influencing her to say dumb shit like every other Trumper. I told her she cannot think for herself and that it's unfortunate. I said that I don't have to be around anyone that makes me uncomfortable. That this is my life and we only get one life to live. I proceeded to block her right after, because if I didn't, she'd fire off more hurtful texts. Since she couldn't get to me, she attacked my grandma, who I'm inifinitely more close with. She flipped out at my grandma without context and said she was moving out that night. My grandma called me very upset and confused, and I had to explain what happened. My anniversary was messed up, thanks to her. Not suprisingly, she also did not move out like she threatened. 

Since then, I haven't spoken to my mother, but I am going back home to visit and I'm going to have to see her. My grandma keeps asking me if I'm going to talk to my mom. I am just trying to figure out where to go from here. I feel like I have to say something to break the silence, but I want her to take accountability, while also avoiding another run-in with the boyfriend. I am so tired of living this way. My mom has made me feel like I'm the crazy one. 

What do I do?

1o0jwqb,"Adopted and parents tell me the orphanaged abused me, not them...","I've been in 3 mental hospitals, 5 therapists, so many medications to find out it's my parents all along. For context: my parents are both pastors--Presbyterian to speak. They homeschooled me with Christian books, unreliable sciencetifc input, and got envious if I spent time with my friends. 

I was adopted at 5 years old by them. I had a lot of medical conditions to begin with but they did help me find the right doctors to treat me. However, as a child, they had to do medical things to me I didn't understand and if I didn't behave, they spank me with anger even when I was already crying. They said that they were following doctor's orders. As I got older, my dad would drag me in the floor, pin me again the bed and tell me I was the problem and no will would love me because who I am. Teenage years, my mom kept telling me I didn't treat her like a human and stop giving her attitude. I hurt myself for attention but the last attempt was suicidal. She told me she broke her break for me and I ask for to much....this was when I asked her if we could talk like reasonable adults without her critiquizing me and not explaining what I did wrong. I've been told I'm a burden and sensitive, even when I called me Dad out for making a Hitler joke in pubic. 

I always blames myself and most of the time, I still do. I use to be the perfect daughter. My mom even called me her favorite when I was wrapped around her finger. At age 16, I was forced to go to church when I didn't want to. My parents told me they kick me out. I kept my bf I secrete for a year because I wanted it to me and him, no one else and my parents are piss at me. I kept life360 so they can make sure I'm safe even when I moved for college states away. 

Now they are treating me like a child and says I'm untrustworthy yesterday when I asked for help. Last year I told them I felt of them hitting and constant emotional abuse. Then they told me that happened at the orphanaged and blamed me for everything over family therapist...the therapist agreeing with them. 

I always feel like a mistake. I'm a produce of ra**. Now my parents are going on vacation and telling me I should've saved money in college and not get out a loan. I only had 5k to start. I am so conflicted, been crying ever day, stressed with loans and school, and still try to give my parents the benefit of doubt. I felt if I was somehow perfect and didn't confess my feelings, be controlled and stepped on like my older sister, I would have a family.

1o0jo7s,Nmom constantly complaining about technology.,"""Rant"" because this periodically involves ranting at me to fix/tell her how to fix something that either a) is outside of my control or b) she refuses to listen when I tell her what's needed.

What prompted the post this time is one of those moments that has me convinced she's a walking techbane... certain forms of technology just don't work for her the way they do everyone else even when she (presumably) uses them the same way.

The rant is because she always acts like _that specific device_ is defective... technically possible but it'll be due to a problem she's had with literally any device with the same function, case in point this morning a step counter.

We all have Samsung phones, we all have Samsung watches--with the nparents having the same model as each other in both cases but different from mine.

See, the ns went shopping today and ""walked all over the store,"" with the result that ndad's phone reported he walked over 5,000 steps while nmom only walked 700. She claims this is why she's so frustrated with that phone (or maybe the watch) but... her previous phone did the same thing. Her FitBit did the same thing. Her Wii U Fit Meter does the same thing. It's not just the one device, it's devices _she_ uses.

And finally, I can understand tracking steps to ""make sure"" you're getting enough activity (though using the exercise bike or Gazelle while watching TV would accomplish that and I don't know when I last saw her trying), but unless you care about bragging rights, why give enough of a fuck to get mad about it? The app just gives fake internet points, it's not like she's using apps that would earn her money from it....

Last time I offered a ""solution"" it was to suggest that maybe she walks too lightly for the device to detect her steps (she's the heaviest person in the family, but you can't ""feel"" her walking around the way you can ndad and nephew--possibly a lingering coping mechanism from dealing with her own n-family) only for her to refuse to ""stomp around"" to get it to work.

Oh, and she'll never actually try to make a warranty claim on the basis of the supposed defect... she'll keep using it for years and complain the ""defect"" has existed since day 1.",SideQuestPubs,1759854712.0,2,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o0jo7s/nmom_constantly_complaining_about_technology/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o0jo7s/nmom_constantly_complaining_about_technology/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False

1o0jeos,My mom went berserk on me for helping my brother.,"Today, my brother came into my room to help him with Minecraft for the Switch. I could find out how to fix the issue (None of the buttons were working), so I had to close the app and reopen it.

As I reopen it, my little impatient brother demands it back, funnily enough, he doesn't know how to navigate the menu. So I politely tell him that I've gotta open his world and see if they would work. He shouts at me to give it back, then my POS mother walks into my room demanding I never help him again.

 I, knowing she's overreacting, give it back, telling him I happily fixed it, while trying to seem nice so The Overreacter doesn't get even more pissed off. Before Little POS brother leaves, I tell him that he should let the Switch charge (It was at 17% battery). 

This causes my mom to go berserk.
She proceeds to tell me that no one will ever like my help and I should never interact with him again. I tell her not to worry about that as I don't appreciate either of their attitudes towards someone who wanted to help. Mom grounds me and slams my door on the way out.

1o0i5ts,Dreamed about my dad last night—grieving,"I got diagnosed with PTSD, and estranged from my parents, a week ago. I posted on here recently about what happened. I still haven't reached out because if I do it feels like they're winning, and I know they'll suck me back in.

For a while right afterwards I was crying constantly, downright catatonic (which is normal for me, dissociative episodes are part of my diagnosis, but it was really bad). Then I got really numb and just started functioning normally. Last night, two things happened that brought back the sadness.

1. At work, someone threatened to have me jumped. I work the late night shift at a grocery store in a rougher area of town. This lady is a repeat offending shoplifter who I have deterred before. Last night, my manager trespassed her from the store, and this lady decided it was my fault. She got in my face and almost tried to fight me, then implied that she's going to send someone to have me jumped in the parking lot. What made me sad about it (besides the fact that I'll have to be on my guard for a while) is that she reminded me so much of my grandmother, who raised my mother. Just that extreme poverty, probably addicted to meth, no resources and deep lifelong pools of trauma that result in no emotional maturity whatsoever. It made me sad for my mother, and ashamed that I think my trauma is so bad. I just got the next level of it, the watered down trauma, the leftover trauma my mom didn't deal with before she had me. Well, she didn't deal with ANY of it actually. I dealt with all of it and left the house at 18, then she decided a 12 step program might be nice. Last night I almost wanted to reach out to my mom, but I have to protect myself too, yeah?

2. I went to sleep and had a dream that my dad gave me a birthday present, and it was this math textbook that he illustrated himself. It was so pretty, themed around fish and sharks, and he drew them all and colored them and laminated the book. As a teen he tutored me for hours every week in math, and science, and this book was a review book, a comic-book style recap of all the things he'd taught. I think learning from him is what I miss, like when I was a teenager he always used to tell me how smart I was, and take me under his wing because I was smart and worth spending his time developing. (There was definite narcissism, and still is, narcissism can feel good sometimes and for me it often used to. I was the golden child and my sister was the lost child, now we're reversed).

1o0hmpd,Parents treat me like incompetent child,"Hi, I'm 21 female currently in college. I'm a few states away from family. The reason why? It's because my parents wanted me to go to a protigsis school even tho they forced me to go to community college for 2 years. Anyway, a lot has happened with me being in school and I told them how I felt through text of being abused by them. Of course they didn't take it well. Anyway, back to the present. I need a personal loan to get an apartment for my Externship. I asked my parents and they refused to do it because ""they don't want it to hurt their credit score and I'm unreliable."" Why am I unreliable, you think? It's because apparently to them, I lied of keeping life360 on when I'm in college. First, I was forced to keep life360 and told them I would to shut them up. I pay for my own phone bill and an adult. But yes, I am unreliable because I don't want to be on life360. And now with another loan I offered, they said that they will ""consider it"" but I can't be trusted. 

Thankfully, I have someone else that will co sign for me and hopefully they will get approved.

But this is different, because this is not some drinks with a friend or something. This is a new JOB. I honestly cannot tell if this was just extreme carelessness on her part (my stuff does not matter to her in the slightest), or an active act of sabotage.

The reason I suspect the latter is because this wouldn't be the first time she sabotaged my career. I had to leave a previous study because of her. And in hindsight,  I think she knew what she was doing. To keep a very long story brief, I was studying in a different town. She was, I can only describe, twisting my arm into coming home to visit her more and more often, under the guise of ""I'm lonely"". And then when I got home, she would always seem to develop a ""bad back"" or something, which meant I had to delay going back. I got in trouble repeatedly for this. Even when I told her I REALLY must spend more time studying, she didn't listen and would actually get angry with me for ""resenting"" being a good son and helping her out after all I did for her. After over a year of this, I couldn't go on any more, and I had to give it up.

As time has gone on I've always felt she was actively trying to sabotage my studies because she felt I was growing too distant and out of her control. And now I worry she might be doing the same here. This isn't a good start. Of all the times to book this surgery, why would she do it just days before I start a new job? After everything I already went through with her, I can't help but see this as a calculated sabotage act.",FeelThePower999,1759849575.0,29,0.94,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o0hcld/nmom_sabotaging_my_career/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o0hcld/nmom_sabotaging_my_career/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False

1o0g8pn,Mum being too controlling and selfish,"21M a college student (Asian, this would save some explanation hopefully) who is living with his parents cause i have no other choice. My mum is being too controlling and selfish. She herself has called me an investment. A failure in her eyes as I chose to pursue computer engineering instead of medicine as she wanted. She keeps bringing up that i didnt get into a med school to this day and from the day she figured i wasnt gonna do medicine her attitude towards me changed drastically , she talks to me with disgust and looks for the smallest of the reason to scold me.

NOW COMING TO THE ACTUAL PROBLEM:

I started dating the loml and we have been dating for a year now (my only relationship in 21 years ), I kept it under rug (I did not want to tell her until I was financially independent so she cant go against it )as ofc Asian parents. My mom has always been against me dating but now somehow that she is suspicious of me dating her attitude has worsened. It has worsened to a point where she can't even stand my voice she starts scolding me for the stuff that happened in the past. She keeps threatening to kill me? Her exact words are ""Ill poison you to death"" either that or ""Ill cut you up into pieces"" and no these are not in a sarcastic tone. I dont know if this is common in Asian households and she's been saying this for a while now so idc enough to be honest. She might do something that I dont date any girl as she thinks she'll lose control over me.  
But honestly I am positive about my current relationship and dont want to lose the only person who keeps me from falling into depravity and depression. 

AM I DOING THE RIGHT THING?

* As of now am gonna keep denying her assumptions even though she is sure 
* Keep riding the low wave for the next two years until I finally leave 
* If she is still persistent and it comes down to the wire I am choosing my girlfriend over her 
* Have as much less of a contact as possible (she would manipulate me)

Is this the right move?",Ordinary-Fan3259,1759847102.0,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o0g8pn/mum_being_too_controlling_and_selfish/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o0g8pn/mum_being_too_controlling_and_selfish/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o0g57l,"Wanted to share some of the things my ndad has said/done in the 8 months since my amazing mother sadly passed away (pancreatic cancer, age 60). Me (27M) and my sister (29F) still live with him.","* Told me that he saw me giving my mum hugs and kisses while she lay asleep in the hospice on her deathbed and asked me why I don't give him physical affection like that.  Ndad saw that affection and felt jealousy – he genuinely said “Why don’t I get any of that?”. 
* Told me I was a 'loveless person' because I didn’t verbally agree that him, me and my sister should ‘lock arms’ on the way out of the church at my mother’s funeral (leading to a big argument two nights before the event). His intentions were clearly that he wants everyone to think we are close-knit family unit than to make the effort to actually be one. In the same conversation I said I don’t really like physical contact (I’m ok with it, I just don’t like *him* touching me). He said “what about last week with mum? You didn’t seem to have any problem with physical contact then.” i.e. in the hospice. It was in this conversation I actually told him I thought he was a narcissist and his response was ""**I won't change, I don't want to change, I don't need to change.""** We haven't talked about it since.
* When my mum was in the hospice he frequently said things like **“This is going to fuck you up for the rest of your life”, “You’ll never be the same.”, “There’s no recovering from this.”** Within the last month we were talking about bereavement care that the hospice offers to families and I said, “You know what? I think I’m doing ok actually.” And before I could draw my next breath, he said, **“You’re never going to be ok, mark my words.”**
* 8 months after my mum’s passing, ndad is still using her ‘blue badge’ to use disabled parking spaces (i.e. to help her when she had doctor's appointments, chemo, etc.). I’ve asked him to stop but he won’t. If he’s gone somewhere and all the disabled bays are full, he’s even had the nerve to say “there’s no way all these people are disabled”, when he has no disability himself (apart from the clear issues being discussed here).
* He’s taken my mum’s phone. We all knew the password, so I know he is reading her messages, including active groups of her friends that her phone number is still on. Every now and then I go on Facebook and her profile is active so he’s clearly using her account to 'stalk' her friends (be nosy). He also turned the location services off on it when he went away recently so he's clearly gone somewhere that he doesn't want us to know about and taken my mum's phone with him for some reason. I've little doubt that he's also probably deleting nasty messages/emails between him and my mum, of which I'm sure there were many over the years, and emails where he’s asked her for money (he owes her father several hundred thousand pounds, and she died not knowing or trusting that he’d ever pay him back. Her parents in their late 80's still live in a care home nearby and will have to move to a much cheaper/worse one within the next year if ndad doesn’t pay them back in full this year.)
* One evening recently, he came back from the pub and asked me how I was. I said “I’m OK, thanks, just really missing \[mum\] at the moment.” The next words out his mouth were, **“Well, if you think about it, you only really knew \[mum\] for about 20 years, I knew her for 41.”** Then he walked off, no doubt pleased that he had won the competition of who should be more sad about my mum dying.
* Everytime I see his friends in public they ask if he's OK in a very somber way. Normally I would expect this is normal but I just know that he is not depressed about my mum's passing at all, as he continues to do whatever he wants, go to the pub on a Tuesday and come home at 4am, verbally abuse me and my sister on a regular basis, and look forward to the next chapter of his life having been bailed out of his financial woes by mum's life insurance money (because my mum's diagnosis was so acute and sudden, he talked her out of putting me and my sister in her will - he said to just put that it should all go to him and 'we'll discuss the rest at a later date.' Unsurprisingly, it never got changed after that.)
* I recently (not proud of this one, but I don't care anymore) caught a 2-minute glimpse of his usually well-guarded Whatsapp messages by sheer chance and have become aware of what we all suspected, which is that he has been in a relationship with another woman for several years. All of this while my poor mum lay at home dying of cancer, wondering where he was going every night, wondering what could be more important than being around during that time. Unsurprisingly, from the few messages I saw to this other woman, I would even say the messages to her were also textbook manipulative and abusive too. One from her even said ""Please be nice to me tonight."" which makes me feel sick.
* Plus the usual going through people's trash and opening my mail 'by accident'.

  
Vent over for now, thank you for reading if you made it this far. Often I find myself writing these things down to remind myself he’s a POS when he can be so polite and charming to the ‘outside world’ - this is just the tip of the iceberg of what's gone in my Notes app in the last year and a half since my mum's diagnosis. I've been seeing a therapist almost weekly for the last year which has equipped me to deal with ndad's shit until I can afford to move out - though I think it's little surprise me and my sister are approaching 30 and still living with him when he has an unquenchable thirst for attention and needs our help doing absolutely everything from sending emails and posting letters to doing food shops and cooking (he recently gave up boiling eggs halfway through because it was taking too long). My experience with this narcissist shows that they are fragile ego-d, emotionally immature, short-tempered children in adult bodies. My strategy of just agreeing with him and saying what he wants to hear keeps him calm and I get out and see friends 2-3 times a week which keeps me sane. Felt compelled to share this in case anyone has experienced something similar and wants to talk about it.

1o0efzo,I finally said how I felt.,"Yesterday I finally snapped. My mum’s been emotionally abusive my whole life. She never apologises for anything and is always the victim. She pushed me yesterday, belittled me, and I finally stood up for myself. Told her not to talk to me like that. Twenty minutes later the conversation had somehow flipped to how I made her sick when I was a baby. I said some very hurtful things in response to this onslaught and now I’m the monster apparently. 

I told her everything. That she’s manipulative, emotionally abusive, and a narcissist. She did her usual routine sarcastically agreeing with any criticism, “yes, I know, I’m an evil monster.”

I already feel guilty. I know her abusive traits come from a place of pain, but I’m tired of that being my problem. I’m tired of being pushed and pushed and pushed until I react, and then she plays the victim.

And I feel… empty. Angry. Confused. She’s the one who hurt me, but somehow I’m the one stuck feeling guilty for finally standing up for myself.

I don’t even know if I want a relationship with her anymore. But she’s my mum. She has no one, she’s pushed everyone away and I’m literally all she has left. I’ve been trying my whole life to build a relationship with her whilst everyone else has given up. How can I have a relationship with someone who doesn’t care how I feel? Who won’t go to therapy? I’ve been in therapy for 10 years on her behalf.

Despite everything, I still get defensive when other people attack her. Even though they are right. I deserve better. And I’m still sitting here thinking this is all my fault.

1o0db6b,"Tired of the constant feelings of guilt, and of the expectations to be their care taker.","After an estenuating work day trying to support and make two of my students think about their actions, emotions, feelings, I received a message from the physician that has my adoptive parents in care.

A picture of a list I made with medical visits my adoptive mother has to undergo.

I explained the content to the doctor.

He, in a way that I read as passive aggressive, answered stating that he will sign the requests then asked who is going to take care of the booking,  because explaining what to do to my adoptive father is impossible.

Meanwhile the judge who has to decide about the nomination of a legal caretaker to help my old adoptive parents both in administrative and personal care, is taking their time.

The guilt erodes and consumes me daily, every day, either if I work, or I take care of house chores, or I  have a social life,or I enjoy a bit my life, I have this lingering feel of guilt, like I was abandoning two fragile people who have done so much for me (starting with my adoption) instead of maintaining my distance from two people who are toxic, from a man who, whenever I stay more than five days at theirs, start belittling, insulting, provoking me, who has stated that I am not his son, who has menaced me just few months ago.

1o0d2p0,"Sometimes I understand why narcs do bad things, and because of that I despise them even more","Most of the time I only have unanswered questions of why narcs do those things.... But sometimes I understand why they act that way. I can see why they would want to do a bad thing. I can see what pushes them to be a bully, to take advantage, to manipulate, etc.

THE THING IS.... even if I can see several reasons to do bad things, I CHOOSE NOT TO. I choose to do the better way. On the other hand, narcs and sometimes even enablers, choose to do the bad thing. And that's why I despise them even more.

Some examples:

There was a time I had an uncomfortable discussion with a relative (not a narc). We both gave each other a chance to speak and listen to each other. This relative is usually soft, quiet, and generous. But at that moment, she started raising her voice at me. I was shocked and in my mind I thought ""What right do you have to scream at me?"". But immediately, I also thought ""Wait no, that is how my Nmom and Nsiblings think. They would target a soft and quiet person, then expect that person to not speak up and stay silent."" So I asked the relative if there was a specific issue that was bothering her. We discussed things and the issue was resolved. No grand screaming match happened, because instead of reacting emotionally, I chose to do the right thing and speak about it like adults. If a narc was in my position, the issue wouldn't be resolved.

Another example is.... I have this covert Nsibling who is very highly manipulative and loves taking advantage of people. Instead of asking, she would take things that aren't hers behind people's back. I tried to speak to her about it but she only denied and deflected. Then she does it again, repeatedly. I thought ""The easy way is I could take advantage of her back to make things even."" But no, I couldn't stand being dishonest especially if there are other ways to do things. So even if I knew that she would be angry and lash out at me, I still chose to speak to her directly and firmly state my boundaries.

TLDR: I understand the reasons why narcs do bad things. They have a choice to NOT do it, but they still do. That's why I despise them even more.

1o0blpb,How to deal with parents' death when it happens one day,"Back story, my mom is a grandiose narcissist, while my sister, who lives with them, is a covert narcissist (who also has BPD). My dad is a spineless doormat who has admitted he doesn't want to go against my mom or sister as it will upset my mom. 5 yrs ago I cut off contact with my sister after 20+ yrs of daily abuse, even after I got married. My parents, of course, decided to back my sister and wanted me to ""forgive and forget"". My husband and I tried explaining some of the abusive things she did when they weren't around, we even did family therapy with my parents. In the end, they couldn't keep their side of the compromise we all agreed to, and kept creating scenarios to force me to spend time with/see my sister (to see how much she's changed).

I noticed it immediately in the months afterwards. She's no longer as careful to hide her narcissistic ideas/thoughts/behaviour.

1o09wvl,Tortured mother going on holiday…,"So my mom is going on holiday, I’m staying to continue my studies. It’s been known that I couldn’t take her to the airport because I have classes (it’s also my first week). Everything went well until she realizes that my classes are online that day. 

She starts saying that I could take her to the airport, I also don’t mind. But I couldn’t for a few reasons :  

- after each lesson there’s a quiz, I couldn’t carry the luggage AND study at the same time in the train. 
- it’s a 1h30 trip to go and 1h30 trip back using public transport. 
- I couldn’t use my phone, it only works using the computer. 

So I’ve basically told her it was impossible unless I bring a computer on the train and also carry the 2 huge suitcases that she herself told me would be hard to carry alone. 
She finally agrees and is a bit sulky, I am too because I would’ve liked to help her and I would’ve if I didn’t have classes. 

So the day comes and in the morning my mom is panicking and packing last minute. She leaves in a rush and I couldn’t really say goodbye but I thought it was okay. She calls me later and tells me that I was torturing her because I didn’t help her bring her suitcases down (literally 2 stairs). I didn’t realize because if she couldn’t bring it down 2 steps then she wouldn’t handle 1h30 mins in public transport. She said she needed to save her strength and that I didn’t even think of her. I can accept that, I could’ve been more attentive and at least helped her all the way. I did apologize. 

But what I didn’t like came after, she already left and went to the train station. She realized that the luggages were too heavy and called me to order her an uber. I told her that it would be complicated because I don’t know her exact position so it would probably be best if she searched for a taxi by herself first and use the uber thing as a backup plan. She tells me that on top of not helping her down i didn’t even want to order her an uber, she says that I love torturing her and that she would always help me when I went but I didn’t help her. And of course our voices were raised by this point. 

I’m just tired to be honest, how am I torturing you ? You chose to bring so much stuff on your holiday, I couldn’t drop you off because of class and because I didn’t help you down 2 steps I’m torturing you ? 

She even says that her shoulders always hurt from carrying heavy stuff but I’m like how am I the cause of that ? You could’ve cut the amount of things you had to bring ? Know your limits ? Like I can help you no problem when I’m available, but this time I’m not. That’s it.

1o07sgy,should i move out or what do i do? also asking for advice on what other things i can do,"so i'll start from the beginning, my dad was abusive to my mother and just a bad partner but never a bad father, they end up separating when i'm 7. after moving, she finds a new partner, and this is where she begins hitting me (her 2nd relationship ever i'm assuming) i'm not really sure about the details of their relationship but this man has had 4 failed marriages, so after shit hits the fan (he cheated on my mom (married this woman) from another country, after my mom had his child). throughout their relationship we had to move from a small town to a city for me getting bullied and needing high school, thus making them long distance which lead to the cheating, when we moved to this city she said it's ""my fault"" , so i interpreted it as blaming me for why she had to leave her partner, (this is important) and constantly made me feel like i'm a burden to her relationship, saying that she wish she didn't have kids so she could go out and have fun (i was 10-11) and was just overall neglectful to me. 2 years later she meets my stepdad and they've been together for 4 years now and married for 2, we had to move into his house, i know i was being rebellious as i've had rules taken off me but stricter rules being put on me again, i've always had trouble with my mom saying she'll send me away to my grandparents or my bio dad, which i just refuse to go because i have alot of stuff like school, jobs and friends where i am, moving to another country in my last year of hs, or a diff state with a diff system that would basically mean ill have to drop out of school. i feel like now that they're married he's feels like he also has a right to say this, wanting to kick me out but also saying they aren't kicking me out but just not tolerating my behaviour and just taking my phone and stuff which i hate. it also annoys me because they had this problem the other day and i went and told my friend that i trusted (they want to keep things that happened inside, inside the house) and he heard this, lots of words were said because of my resentment towards her that was never solved, or i just never got an apology. so fast forward a day later im not in the mood because of the overwhelming stress and they are all jolly again, so later in the evening hes mad at me because i have a bad behaviour ? (just avoiding talking to anyone, having a sad impression on my face because i did not wanna go out) so after a couple hours spent by myself just thinking how im gonna get out of this household for good. im putting away groceries and he tells me to put something down and sit in the corner of the couch, as im putting what i have in my hand down, he grabs my wrist to try and pull me out of the kitchen, i am saying ""ow ow"" and backing in the corner and just screaming ""don't touch me"", and then he proceeds to saying ""im not gonna be set up by you"" ??? like i just don't get how when hes the one who's tightly grabbing my wrist to force me into the corner of the couch when i was gonna comply anyways. so that lead up into the present now, i might've forgotten to add some key points as im writing this solely to get my feelings out, i dont really know what to do, i dont really have alot of money saved up but i do have a job and am able to get another one and i graduate school in about a month so im looking into my own place but im worried on how ill struggle with money because im also trying to get a car of my own. 

my plan is to take a gap year and work, and if i get accepted into uni, i'll go but if not i wanna join my states police force, any advice? for ref i live in australia and i just don't know if i should behave like how they want and bide my time and save money for a car first and then leave or  should i move out in a months time just to escape and try to save up for a car eventually.

1o07lkw,Parents breaking NC via my work repeatedly resetting my progress.,"I've been NC with my Nmom for several years now & mostly thriving, but I work a fairly public facing job - my work contact details are easy to find. After exhausting all other methods of blocking my Nmom, including paying monthly for an app that blocks voicemails, she's recently began using multiple accounts to contact me via my work emails.   
She alternates between giving me life updates from a family I don't want to to hear from, or shocking guilt trips and insults. 

While my father is not a narcissist, he defends my mother and reports back to her, so I am also NC with him. Several years before I went NC with both of them, he tried to spike my drink with a controlled substance as a painkiller after I repeatedly declined the offer - I suppose I shouldn't be surprised that he also wouldn't respect my request for no contact.  
Recently, he tracked me down at a work conference I was attending, and attempted to reinitiate contact during the most important event of my career. I sat and spoke with him, but after seeing no evidence of change I declined to get back in contact. I told him that if he was to ever have contact with me again it would be on my terms, not his or my Nmoms - but now I fear that he'll show up the next time I'm on a trip.

It took me weeks to recover from that interaction, and every email from my Nmom puts me into a brainfogged and insomniac state for days after - just being reminded of their existance is putting me back into the same mental survival state as when I lived with them. I've been thinking back to my childhood regularly and it's becoming increasingly distressing.   
It's just so frustrating to be brought back to all of this when going NC has allowed me to start living a fulfilled life!

If either of them appear at work or an event again I'm going to have to call security, but it's not a situation I want to have to consider. It's not the sort of role that I can ask anyone for accomodations on - I am functionally self-employed.  
Giving up my career is not an option as I love the role I'm working now, even with this issue. So far I've been ignoring the emails out of a fear that responding will lead to a greater frequency, but I wonder if it's reached a point where I should be responding with a firm ""no thanks"". Should I begin making legal threats.? 

Admittedly I also have not attempted therapy in my adult life after a bad experience with a college therapist - is this the kind of situation that therapy would help me get through?

Any advice for dealing with the root of the problem (or the emotional effects) is very welcome, but so is any commiserations from anyone that's dealt with a similar situation. I feel very alone in this as it's not something anyone I know has to deal with.

1o07gor,Shocked at the age of “realisation” on this topic.,"Whenever I read the comments on here I’m a bit surprised but also a bit sad “how late” most people come to the realisation that their parents have a narcissistic personality disorder. 
Most comments say something like : “ I realised when I was 45” or “ I realised when I became a parent”. 

Accepting/integrating the truth is one of the hardest things we have to do as adults. 

I guess we all know why it’s so damn HARD! We’ve all read books, listened to podcasts and lectures on why this feels so heartbreaking. 

My question is: *how do we make sure that future generations don’t wait as long as we have? What do you guys do other than being active on Reddit to tell YOUR TRUTH?

1o073q9,I am the bad daughter who argues with her mom,"My mom keeps humiliating me and tries to provoke me to get a rise from me, every single day. 

 Most days I grey rock and pretend I don't care. But then it starts building up inside me and one final insult from her and I start reacting. 

It feels my mom just tests my patience.

 Anyways, when I react, I start telling her what she has been doing to me for so many days and it often ends into an argument. I start shaking, crying, have loss of voice and also start stammering (though I never have stammered in my entire life. This happens only when my mom blames me for something she is doing to me!)

 I get loud, not screaming but good enough. The neighbors can hear us as the walls are thin and even connected. While every family has fights, i wonder what they must be thinking about me.

 Because my mother abuses me for days but it's hidden and my reaction to her abuse is loud.

And when i react, my mom sits back and enjoys my emotional outburst and acts like the poor victim mother.

 Maybe the neighbors think i am a bad daughter! I dont know! The other day a next door neighbor was looking at me in a different way.

Also is there way to stop this emotional outbursts and keep the insults from building inside me? 
I know the situation yet unable to stay calm.

1o06hrc,My parents got mad at me for refusing to invite my siblings everywhere. Now we’re not talking.,"Basically, my (29 YOF) siblings (27 YOM and 25 YOF) and I have been sheltered our whole life, I have recently (past 3 years) found some independence by moving out, getting a fiancè, etc. My siblings still live at home. Recently my brother was on a work trip and texted me “Hey can I pop in real quick on my way back from my work trip?”, because I live in between my parents house and where he usually goes for work. He’s done this before, hung out a few hours and left. I told him of course. I knew I had a board game night with new neighbors (I recently moved) that night, but knew he was coming over around 2, so I figured he probably wouldn’t be staying through that. So he came over at 4, and when he was over he asked if he could do some stuff on his work laptop. I prepped a charceuterie board for the game night while he worked. He didn’t really ask me about the game night, nor about my board. Conversation focused mostly on him. We got food, he played video games with my fiance for a bit, then we noticed it was approaching when we were supposed to leave for game night and my brother realized it was a good time to go. As he was headed towards the door my dad called him asking where he was at. I asked my brother if he told my dad he was stopping here and he said he forgot so I figured my dad was nervous about where he was, or he was expecting him. All in all it was a pretty good day with my brother, but when I was at the board game night, which was hosted at my neighbors by the way, I started getting bombarded with texts from my parents scolding me for not inviting my brother to the game night.

 I tried to explain to them that I felt awkward when it was a night for the neighbors to get to know each other, and because my dad asked where he was I figured he was expected at home , and he didn’t show any interest in it, and from his text, I just figured he didn’t plan on staying long. They were being VERY hard on me regardless. I reached out to my brother, confused, because he never told me he was upset. He told me he wasn’t bothered at all by it until my mom “reminded him of how much he loves board games”… so I started to think about it and got upset my parents got involved in the first place when my brother and I were able to calmly talk through things. 

So I asked my mom to stop getting involved in things and encourage her adult children to just communicate with each other. She got highly defensive. I told her I wanted an apology for how she came down on me and I would be pulling back from communication until she did so. She gave a lot of gripe until finally she apologized. I gave my dad a similar message, wanting to hold him accountable too for barraging me with my mom, and he simply said “so be it”… without apology. So as of now my father and I are not on speaking terms.

And then recently a similar situation happened. My cousin told me that she was planning a trip to California and her two friends dropped out, so with three days notice she asked me/her sister (who are both currently unemployed) to go. We both said yes, because..why not. She booked flights, accommodations, and I think she may have had stuff planned already or reservations but idk. Well my mom called me irritated I didn’t invite my sister. I told her my sister has a full-time job, she wasn’t invited because there is no way she would’ve been able to get three days off with two days notice. My mom told me I should’ve invited her anyway. She then proceeded to call me selfish and that I don’t prioritize my relationship with my siblings. Well, she deleted THAT message but I had already seen it and texted her “too late” and she said “well, just like dad said, so be it”. I told her again to stop getting involved.

 I personally, don’t see why any of this is so wrong, given the context of the situations. Plus, there’s plenty my mom does that she does not invite me to, my sister does, hell even plenty them four do without inviting me. So now I’m not on speaking terms with my dad, and very well might not be with my mom.

I’ve been reading this sub for a few months and so much of it sounds like her, she sets him up to fail constantly, then threatens to destroy his belongings, pull him out of school and move, driving recklessly to scare him, silent treatment, screamed at him for hours on his birthday because he posted on insta thanking my daughter for a great birthday instead of her, just on and on.  He helped me with some boxes the other day and I thought of mentioning how helpful and sweet he was to her but I thought twice because she would definitely use that against him in some way.  I do not feel it’s my place to offer this kid advice, or would that be ok? I’d love to mention the Gray Rock technique.  Is my daughter safe around this woman?

1o05q9n,Feeling like there's no real adult around,"I have felt like in my experience with mom who is a covert narcissist and my emotionally avoidant father who has a few narcissistic traits - it's almost like there was no solid adult around. I didn't have any other relationships with adults that could help me - my aunts and uncles lived in different states, and I was so quiet and anxious in class that a lot of teachers didn't get to know me. It felt like there wasn't a mentor or someone to talk to, that would react reasonably if I had something going on. 

This has impacted my therapy and healing journey a lot - I think it's something that propelled it forward. It felt like for so long I had no adult to talk to, no guide, and it just over the years became unbearable. It became easier to change and become emotionally mature myself rather than wait for my parents to do so. So I learned how to control my emotions and regulate, and ways to treat people in arguments that are healthier. I learned why people get triggered by things and how that prevents actual resolution from happening. I had a lot of attachment issues from this situation - fearful avoidant attachment, so it took me many years to do all of this. Years of therapy, learning, the right SSRI, because on top of that I had severe ocd from my experiences and an eating disorder. 

I currently am still living at my dad's house because I'm in eating disorder recovery and can't work at the moment. There are so many times where he lashes out or says something rude or just is NOT able to control his emotions or be regulated or be an adult. He gets mad over petty things and I can't remember the last time I felt guided by him. It sucks. But I also know that we would be in constant conflict if I hadn't learned not to respond to triggers and outbursts from therapy. And that makes me relieved. It's exasperating, that he acts like this sometimes. But I know how to handle it, and therefore my life is pretty peaceful because of these boundaries I put up. I'm wondering if this has been a propelling factor in anyone else's experience. That you've almost had to work on things, go to therapy, because the alternative - being in conflict all of the time - is worse than dealing with all of the shit in your brain.

1o05692,"Just recently realized after an argument I had with my mother that she likely remembers none of the shit she put me through specifically, and i realized i resentbher for that.","I recently had an argument with my mother about something,. and at some point, i raised the topic of a specific example of past physical and emotional abuses to prove a point: I was 9 or 10 and was taking a bath to get ready for school. I was told I'm staying home to finish the chores i didn't finish the night before (I'd been up late till 12 or 1 am the night before cleaning the house). 

Her response ""I have never kept you from school at all!""  ""Then why do I remember it?"" ""Maybe because you hate me that much that you think i was a shitty mother?"". With every argument we've ever had, she'll gaslight me and my words around that ends in me feeling like maybe i am being an asshole, and my mom's crying in her room closed off.

It was at this point i realized: NO! That absolutely did happen. I won't be gaslit into thinking what she did to me was never real, so I've spent hour remembering, then writing a list of events i can remember. I can never show it to her because I realize she'll never acknowledge it. And i realized how much i resent her for that. So i need to get it out there. I have no therapist, and no friends i feel would understand or care. so i guess this is a good spot. I guess im just looking for acknowledgement somewhere. So here it is:


-I remember Mom getting in a fight while holding me. This is the earliest memory I have.

-I remember Me and Diamond playing on the bed with mom  She asked if i loved her and i said no as a joke thinking we were still playing. She spanked me, locked me out of the apartment and said find a new mommy then as punishment. I was only playing.

-I remember staying home from school one day to help clean.

-I remember being beaten if i didn't clean the kitchen within a certain time period.

-I remember staying up late lots of nights on a school night cleaning.

-I remember anytime I attempted to verbally defend myself would result in beatings for arguing.

-I Remember (many times) mom yelling at me while i was crying after she had beaten me. Then a look would cross her face and she would start beating me again because I had given her a dirty look or was ""thinking bad thoughts about her"". This is why i can't look someone in the eyes while being yelled at.

-I remember mom beating me if i didn't look her in the eyes while she was yelling at me.

-I remember mom holding my wrist down and hovering a knife over it threatening to slice. I still have nightmares about this.

-I remember mom grabbing me by the throat and throwing me into a wall while she was yelling at me one time.

-I remember having suicidal thoughts from the ages of 9 up until DHS temporarily removed us.

-I remember telling myself often: ""When I grow up: I'm moving far away from here.""

-I remember having to fake cry while mom or dad was beating or spanking me so they wouldn't beat me harder until I actually cried.

-I remember that wooden spoons and switches fresh picked from trees hurt the worst.

-I remember the beatings getting worse when we lived next to Helen. Helen would encourage her to beat me harder because mom wasn't being hard enough. 

-I remember Helen was a twisted bitch of a woman who befriended my mother and was also given full permission to beat us when she babysat. She later stole some stuff from our parents while we were away and they were moving. I don't resent helen for that and sometimes think it was karma.

-I remember several times, my mom hitting me so hard in the stomach i couldn't breath.

-I remember having to wear clothes that covered the welts and bruises. 

-I remember knowing even at 9 that something wasn't right at home and I would never treat my children the way i was treated growing up.

-I remember feeling safest at school because the school counselors were kind to me and made me feel safe. My mom hated her.

-I remember when I was 9 after one of the more severe beatings, packing a backpack full of clothes and attempting to run away. I returned because i was scared.

-I remember getting yelled at for telling teachers and counselors the truth about the welts and bruises and every time the schools and CPS started contacting my parents to schedule visits. 

-I remember the time I spent at the child shelter as the happiest time of my life. THE FUCKING CHILD SHELTER! Because the adults didn't beat me or yell at me for looking at them wrong. I did chores but i had help from the other kids and adults. 

-I remember crying when i returned home from CPS. Not because i was finally going gome but because I didn't want to go.

-I remember the suicidal thoughts returned up until I entered middle school. Sometimes they come back.

-I remember the family therapist/counselor telling me I had ADHD and depression.

-I remember the same counselor/therapist saying my mother had (either) borderline or bipoler personality disorder. She says she was never diagnosed. But I remember it.

Because of my past experiences as a child, seeing an adult strike a child angers me more than it would anyone else, I have suicidal thoughts, my defense response is freeze and fawn, i have great difficulty standing up for myself, seeing children upset makes me irrationally upset, i cannot look authoritative figures in the eye, and when someone has a certain look on their face  i shy away and try to placate instead of defende myself.

All this has resulted in one fucked-up, depressed, anxiety ridden, adult and i hate that i resent and blane her for that but i finally realized I'm not wrong.",nate_ranney,1759811311.0,20,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o05692/just_recently_realized_after_an_argument_i_had/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o05692/just_recently_realized_after_an_argument_i_had/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o04ydq,Help with MIL,"Im (H) 24F seeking advice to deal with my MIL. I’ll keep the back story short: my fiancé  (D) (25M)  and myself love separate lives for right now until we are financially ready to move into a house. We are trying to not have any other added stress onto our plates and my MIL is causing actual health issues due to stress. 

Early in the relationship I got super sick (like near death) and my MIL kept repeating to D “she’s gonna d** and you’ll have no one else to take care of you” “they will never find out what’s wrong with her…” “you’ll never see her again…” stuff like that. Spoiler they found out what was wrong with me. Besides the point. 

My MIL is SUPER dedicated to the church. Like hard core Catholic. Once she found out that I was not raised that way she acted like I was scum. MIL has told the Father at that church every single thing about D and made herself out to be the “saint” that she thinks she is even through MIL eggs on D to get a rise.  MIL even had my brother -in-law’s gf tag up on me on Mother’s Day because I had to work and afterwards my fiancé and myself were going to go see my mother for dinner but because my MIL had last second (legit) plans to go for brunch and my fiancé said no everyone had to get involved. I went on a 5 day cottage trip with them. Of the 4 nights I was there I cried myself to sleep every night because of the harmful words she would say about my body image, my fiancé and our relationship and just overall making us feel shitty. My FIL bought MIL a brand new car (50k cost) and a new house (that MIL’s parents demanded FIL bought) all because MIL refused to clean their old house and treated her old car like garbage. MIL will ,and continue to do so, call her parents to throw a tantrum and blames it on anxiety (she’s been on the same pills for 20 years on the same dosage), slams doors and just yells at everything when she doesn’t get her way. 

D used to work for his family and then he got a much better job with less stress. MIL was doing payroll so she would see how much he worked and how much he earned. When he got the new job she flipped because now she has no control over him, doesn’t know what he makes and what his hours are. Instead of saying she’s proud of him, she put him down saying “the family business is in shambles now that no one can take it over” 

Both D and myself had to get new vehicles. I don’t make much but I was still able to get a reliable vehicle. Once D got his car, MIL’s exact words were “I don’t know how H can afford her car she doesn’t work that much” (I work 40hrs/week meanwhile she has 3 jobs works 20 total hours and can’t even make more than over the poverty line) and D defended me saying that I work hard and don’t foolishly spend my money which she does when there’s dozens of Amazon packages coming to the house every day. 

MIL had opened packages and letters addressed to D and have taped them back up. I caught MIL once and screamed at her because it was my engagement ring that was shipped and she opened ruining that surprise. 

D recently got into an accident and MIL decided to show up at the scene and act like she was the one that got hit. Once D said leave and some other cuss words she flipped out and drove off after D said that I was on my way to assist, MIL said “it’s not H’s responsibility to help you tell her to turn around and leave. Later that week MIL decided to have a “family meeting” ended up being an ambush that ended with MIL saying “you’re no longer a part of this family”. Yet my family has welcomed D into their home and lives and treats him like one of theirs. There is no bs with my family. 

We have tried the silent treatment, we’ve tried gray rocking, we tried setting boundaries and nothing is working. She seems like the big boss of narcissists. I’m scared of what is coming next once D and myself move in together and start a family. We have already decided on cutting all communication since we feel it would be better for our health. 
Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you! ",Automatic_Spend4673,1759810608.0,1,0.99,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o04ydq/help_with_mil/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o04ydq/help_with_mil/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1o04ht8,im starting to think my mom is an abuser but i want a second opinion,"\[TW: INAPPROPRIATE TOUCHING\]



first off some general background information.

my (19mtf) parents have been divorced since i was 3, unless stated otherwise assume my dad was either unaware or uninvolved at any given point.

i have an ADHD diagnosis but i strongly suspect i could also be autistic (mom is strongly against letting me get a diagnosis).

i have a lot of different things i want opinions about so theres a good chance this post is going to be all over the place, please forgive me.

  
i honestly dont know what to think about her because one moment she says she loves me and does something genuinely nice for me, then the next she dismisses my feelings, yells at me and calls me a parasite.

ive tried talking to her about this but whenever i try to she either denies ever doing that, says she doesnt remember or starts justifying her actions and explaining her reasoning.

she generally doesnt respond well to criticism of any kind, occasionally she will sit down and pretend to listen only to then change nothing about her behavior.

she very often boasts about all the good things shes done for me and tells me to be grateful for having her as a mother.



quite often when i reach out for help she starts complaining about how hard raising me was and how i never take her feelings into account.

for example when i wanted to drop out of school due to constantly feeling stressed and anxious whenever i was there she told me that i didnt give it a real chance (despite having been at that school for 2 years) and got angry that i didnt appreciate all the work she put in to get me into that school, she was also quick to remind me that i chose to continue my education (the alternatives were all even more demanding and would have drained me even more).

another example is when nearly every morning in middle school through high school i would ask her to let me stay home because i was feeling awful, to which she would tell me everyone struggles in school and that i just need to persevere and that it would get easier with time.

when i told her i really couldnt go she would stand her ground and argue with me until either i gave up or she had to go to work, either way she got angry at me for wasting her time.

  
she also doesnt really respect my boundaries, she barges into my room whenever she wants (took me years to convince her to even let me close my door), looks through my phone, email and text messages.

whenever i do anything without her she badgers me for details, be it a meeting with friends, a conversation with gaming buddies or a therapy appointment.

for nearly 10 years now shes also had a habit of telling me how much she ""loves my butt"", after which she proceeds to slap it.

  
whenever she doesnt get her way or feels that im not contributing enough she tends to threaten taking away my possessions, for example taking my phone or disconnecting my PC.

about 4 months ago she also threatened to kick me out of the house, after which she ""apologized"" by saying that she was angry and wasnt thinking clearly.

  
lately shes also started exploiting me financially, this last month ive paid for restaurants/takeout nearly every time, as well as paying the electric bill in full.

this is in addition to other expenses i now have to cover, such as clothing and meds.

she also very often ""jokes"" about how she knows i will take care of her when shes old to pay back all the good shes done for me.



i also forgot to mention that whenever i have a panic attack or any other form of clearly visible distress in public shes more worried about making a scene and how it makes her look rather than my wellbeing.



im sure theres more stuff im forgetting but i cant think of anything right now, i dont really know what to think or do so i would love any and all advice you might have for me, thanks.",unicat42,1759809133.0,4,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o04ht8/im_starting_to_think_my_mom_is_an_abuser_but_i/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o04ht8/im_starting_to_think_my_mom_is_an_abuser_but_i/,raisedbynarcissists,True,True,False,False,False,,False

1o043f6,Silent treatment from Nmom while pregnant,"2 weekends ago my mom and I got into a fight. I still gave her a hug at the end of the night and told her I loved her while she ignored me and didn’t thank me for helping her move furniture. 
She’s been giving me the silent treatment ever since. She’s been doing this off and on ever since I was a child. I’m sick of it. I told her several times that it’s not cool and if she wants to drop out of our lives that’s fine, to let me know and I’ll remove her from everything. I even apologized for what I said during the argument. She has left me on read several times. She keeps this up for as long as she feels like it, sometimes can be weeks sometimes a few months. 
She sent me a video on Facebook on Sunday so i figured maybe she wasn’t that angry anymore, so I sent her picture updates from the sonogram I had today. She ignored me again and left me on read. I was going to have her in the hospital room while birthing but if she wants to continue to be a child and neglect me some more than why should I let her have anything to do with me and the baby? Of course she still wants to be buddy buddy with my boyfriend, although she doesn’t talk to him unless we are together. 

Do I go no contact? do i go low contact when she decides to start responding like nothing happened? Do i leave her out of the hospital and away from the baby for awhile? 

Which would be smart because she’s a smoker and looked at me like I had 3 heads when i said no smoking around my baby and she has to wash hands and change clothes, like she won’t take my seriously. 

What do I do?? It’s pissing me off since this is the 6193752th time she’s done this!!! She’s 47 by the way !!!! And still a fucking child!

1o03zdw,Coming to Terms with NParents,"Coming to terms with my parents behavior and looking for any advice. For context my parents are very conservative and religious. Some examples of behavior I remember experiencing growing up include my mom defaulting to “well I guess I’m the worst mother ever”, my dad cherry picking which accomplishments of mine were worthy of praise and never mentioning or diminishing others, extreme tracking of my online content and then drastic punishments (for example they found porn and threatened forcing me to go to the college in my hometown so they could monitor my behavior), required me to share my location with them “as long as they were paying for the phone”, my NDad in particular can never be wrong no matter how many facts you try to present to the alternative. Despite these they were still supportive and loving in many other ways as a disclaimer. 

In college I started dating my now girlfriend and at one point in my sophomore year my NDad found evidence that she had stayed the night and lost it and when home seething. I kind of just from then (4 years ago) until now just was WOES to not risk losing their financial support. Now my girlfriend and I live together in a different city and I have heard from my brother that my parents still make comments to other people about how they don’t approve of how we live together or how I’ve gone off the deep end politically etc. For all of these reasons I’ve never really felt comfortable talking with them about feelings or personal issues growing up out of fear of punishment or being brushed off etc, and now that I live on my own I’ve pretty much gone LC only visiting a couple of times a year for holidays. 

Now my brother is a freshman at an out of state university 6 hours from home and my parents had said they would pay for his tuition. He is in a newish long distance relationship and he and his gf have been doing  alternating visits every other week. This last weekend while she was visiting our parents showed with little notice to his apartment and found some of items of his gf’s. They then ranted at him for an hour ultimately saying that they wouldn’t be paying for his tuition anymore. It’s also important to note that they have already paid ~100k~ on a trailer that my brother was supposed to live in the next four years of school. Which of course was used as a leverage tool in their argument. 

Obviously they can choose to not pay for his school. I think it’s just the rational and the way they’ve gone about it that makes me feel like this is more about control than anything else. Now my brother and I are pretty set on not going back home for Christmas. I don’t think my parents have even considered that we might respond to their actions in kind. I’ve also told my brother I can help him out in the case that they escalate to fully cutting him off. It’s become the final straw for me and I’m tired of letting their comments slide. Right now I’m planning on not saying anything until they bring up holiday plans. But any suggestions or advice are welcome!

1o03kue,"Black sheep, how did you process cutting off your entire bloodline?","I 28(m), the youngest and black sheep, have been no contact with my NP’s for 3 months after I pointed out it had been over a year to which I told them over the phone I was going to kill myself that night, to which they made the phone call about all of their issues and problems and showed no concern, and never followed up with my well being after that. That got defensive when I pointed it out, go figure. I sought out support from my oldest sister, who at first was supportive and validating, but the covertly began to weaponize therapy, intellectualize, and push to conform me to fall back in line and remove my boundaries through conditional support and love. Accused me of “piecing together my own narrative” on how things happened after countless therapy sessions of my own. Had no issue going NC after that. Finally the golden child older brother. Haven’t talked in months. Relationship was always superficial, this week I thought I had nothing to lose so reached out for support for everything. What do you know, still has “hopes that I can have patience with the NP’s, and fulfill their needs of wanting to have grandchildren”. Then continued to speak about importance of family, and that I should hope the NP’s can get into a better place so I can be a good son. He did say some validating things, and tried understand my perspective on things, and that he wanted to take time to try and imagine some of the trauma from my perspective, but I’m not hopeful for anything and am just as prepared to go no contact with them as well. 

I’m just trying to understand, how does one process cutting off their bloodline entirely? I know the good to come out of it as I’m already feeling it, but I don’t know if I’m just numb to things, or don’t know how to feel at the fact that my family doesn’t love me unconditionally and that the fact of cutting all ties without hesitation doesn’t bother me one bit? 

Update: I was shocked waking up and seeing the amount of overwhelming support, advice, and relating experiences. I’m very grateful to everyone who commented. I found every comment helpful and comforting. After reading everyone’s comments I’ve been able to understand a lot more about how I can cope, as well as realizing it’s what’s best for me.

1o032kn,"""You don't like me, but you like your mother, haha.""","Yesterday, I visited my parents for some pastries, tea, and a chat.  (Let's call them Bob and Mary.)  Within minutes of us sitting down, Bob yelled at Mary for interrupting his monologue to offer us extra fruit.  ""Can you stop interrupting me?  You don't talk until I'm done talking!""

The younger me would have intervened and confronted Bob, only for the situation to escalate and for Mary to call me later, asking me why I'm so disrespectful to the man who raised me.  She'd make excuses.  She'd remind me of his good side, of his traumatic past.  She'd harp on his dedication to paying the bills and the fact that he'd never cheated on her.  ""He's also never hit me,"" she'd say, like my abuse never happened.  ""Kids can handle it.  It's how we discipline them.""  I'd ask her why she doesn't leave someone like Bob.  She'd say, ""I'm too old and useless now.""  Then she'd cry.  She might even bounce back to asking me to reconcile.  ""No one will ever love you like your parents, you know?""

I bit my tongue and leaned away, disgust on my face.  If Bob noticed, he didn't show it.  Mary disappeared into the kitchen, smile gone.  Bob's eyes lit up, and he picked up the thread of his monologue.  He had ironically interrupted Mary when she mentioned a biopic she was watching, rattling off his opinions before Mary had a chance to share what she liked about it.

Bob doesn't notice when people are turned off.  Bob's like a honey badger; Bob don't give a shit.

Bob ran out of opinions about Mary's new show -- no, he wasn't watching it -- and Mary got a chance to share what she'd learned so far, between sweetly offering him more fruit and pouring him tea.  The conversation migrated to current politics.  Bob looked at me and dipped his toe in the water.  ""I know you don't like to hear me talk about this, but I blame the Jews.""

I nodded and made an unamused hum, glancing at Mary.  She wasn't bothered.  She'd read Currency Wars.

We started grasping for different topics to talk about.  I excused myself to go home and do chores.  I smiled and hugged Mary, and as I turned to hug Bob, he chuckled and said, ""You don't like me, but you like your mother.""  He wanted reassurance.  I just hugged him.  I heard his breath catch.  I managed to shut the car door before the sorrow caught up to me.

1o02pvy,My parents have went insane..,"This is my first time posting here and I was recommended by a friend when I began telling her what was going on, I feel like I'm crazy and like a horrible daughter. 

I (24F) got a call from my mom (53F) saying she discovered my “dad” (53M) has been paying  $300 a week  to some  Asian dating site  that promises men a “wife.” She noticed the recurring charges ,  over $2,000 total, and when she did some digging, she confirmed it really was one of those international “find a wife” sites.

When she confronted him, he got furious and told her he doesn’t love her anymore. I’m still trying to wrap my head around how fast everything’s fallen apart.

About six months ago, he was diagnosed with low testosterone and has been on several different hormone meds. Now his estrogen is supposedly high, and he’s taking pills for that too. I don’t know if this is connected, but his behavior has gotten a lot worse.

For context: I’ve always had a strained relationship with him. He was abusive toward me growing up,  physically and emotionally , though he never hit my mom back then. Recently that changed. When my mom tried to take his phone one night, hes choked her hard enough to leave fingerprints. He’s become extremely hostile and unpredictable. She refuses to all the cops because it'll "" ruin his job"". They're in there  50s and are semi making it pay check to pay check because of so many poor financial decisions they keep making. 

What’s confusing is that less than a year ago, he was devastated when my mom was diagnosed with cancer. He was terrified of losing her. We even went to the aquarium as a family just a few weeks ago, and everything seemed normal. Now it feels like a switch flipped.

My mom is stuck between saying she wants a divorce and begging him to talk to her. She’s always chased this fantasy of a perfect family and refuses to face the reality of the abuse. When I’ve brought up how he treated me in the past, she shuts down or says she’ll “talk to him,” but nothing ever changes.

I’m terrified for her. I love her deeply, but I can’t carry her emotional weight anymore. Since I was a kid, I’ve been the “parentified child” ,taking care of her feelings after her divorce from my biological dad. It’s exhausting. She calls me crying, asks me what to do, or wants me to go places with her at night just so she’s not alone.

I want to support her, but I can’t keep being her emotional lifeline when she won’t protect herself. I feel guilty for wanting to step back, but I’m burning out. I don’t know what to do anymore.

Has anyone been through something like this?  How did you handle it? I feel like I'm going crazy and the stress is eating me alive. 

To top it all off I recently just got engaged to my long term partner and we are planning for a child, the stress is killing my PCOS and mental well being.

1o02ibl,Finally No Contact,"(Trigger warning: mention of suicidal thoughts.) 

This is my first post here after my cousin telling me how supportive this group was for her when she got away from her narcissistic mom. 

Backstory: I was always a “daddy’s girl” growing up. I was his favorite. But when I moved in with him in high school, it all began to unravel. I was his favorite because I realized he needed the love, praise, and reverence young me would give. I looked up to him. But as I got older and realized that I was his emotional support, that everything HE did was MY emergency, that if I tried to set a boundary, I was degraded and more, that whole relationship began to wither. 

Almost two months ago, I finally cut him off. I wanted to be away from this Earth because of him, and I knew that if I didn’t make this choice to be rid of him now, it was over for me. I pretty much ghosted him, since all of my previous attempts to try and talk sense or explain my case resulted in degradation and manipulation. 

I never thought I’d be able to start healing until he was dead. I know that sounds bad. But now that I finally feel a little safer, I’m doing some unlearning and healing. I didn’t realize how much he made me hate myself. I never felt worthy of anyone or anything, and have been a bundle of anxiety and depression. 

I’m sure I’ll be venting here as my journey continues. It wasn’t just narcissism. But there was so much of that. I can’t believe I stood up to my life’s biggest bully. I learned that I can do hard things. I’m beginning to be happy.

1o0206f,Not only are they narcissists but..,"*not sure what to do; kind of just needed to get it off my back and scream into the void*

Theyre predators too? Which I mean by nature, I suppose, goes hand in hand. Let me explain..

So my mom tells me that she isn't sure between two brothers which may be my father so I've recently started doing a little digging and spoken to both potential biological contributors. One has actually kept contact with her over the past 30 years since my conception, and apparently still considers her a friend while the other has moved 2 states away and built a new life. 2 states away dude told her 30 years ago that everyone she had been sleeping with needed to take a paternity test before he would bend to her will. In classic narcissistic fashion, she threw a fit and started running a smear campaign that she was the victim and he was hanging her out to dry as a single mother. That's when the man that I have called dad my whole life stepped up and said he would take care of us and, of course, I give him credit for that. 

Growing up, especially after my parents had my younger brother, multiple family members called my parents out on the hypocrisy of their treatment between the two of us kids and one of my mom's cousins had called CPS at one point for the way specifically I was being treated. I had been in and out of the social worker's office with multiple schools since sixth grade and that CPS visit happened sometime in early high school. My parents say now that they ""just didn't understand why [I]had such trouble when [I]was younger"" but didn't have any issue rushing to take care of my brother when he experienced the same issues, like trying to kill ourselves. 

In my young adulthood, it was revealed that my parents had always had an open marriage and there were extra partners in their relationship from the very beginning. Thats what led me to find out that my biological father was undetermined and also pulled the curtain back on the extreme sexual deviancy my parents participated in, although that curtain was pretty sheer to begin with if we're being honest.

Now to the point I'm trying to make about their predatory behaviors. In speaking with one of my potential biological fathers, his recollection of the events he participated in with my mother were very coerced and deceptive, which is why he isn't particularly fond in digging up any history on my behalf, to the point that he has lashed out at me for, by his perception, having ulterior motives. 

The man that I call dad has been a willing participant in my mother's song-and-dance from before I was even a twinkle in her eye and it's been recently revealed to me that he may also be a different kind of sick and twisted. My cousin, who is my mothers sisters daughter, and is about the same age as my brother, told me that the man I call dad had been playing cards with her and her fiancé, along with my mother, and he had been making very blatant sexual suggestions about partner swapping. When the fiancé called him out about it, he later began snapping my cousin's bra strap and had poked her upper arm repeatedly with enough force that it left bruising. Unfortunately, I am aware that my parents do regularly participate in impact play so he knows what he was doing. 

So it leaves me very concerned that I am living with two very toxic people, in more ways than one,  and due to the fact that I would be literally homeless if their basement wasn't available, i have no way out of their influence. I barely make enough money to put myself through college and afford basic necessities, even though I'm making the most money I've ever made my entire life so far. I've already been homeless before due to an abusive partner which is the whole reason I had to come back to my parents' house in the first place. My younger brother now has 2 kids who I feel could be in danger in the future and my brother makes excuses to enable my parents' poor behaviors, talking down to me about it as if I'm not mature enough to understand why they behave the way they do when I'm the one who's going to school to be a social worker so it's literally going to be my entire job to understand why people behave the way they do.

TL/DR - my parents are hypocritical narcisisstic sexual deviants, and I have no means to support myself and get away from them.

1o01leo,How did your nParent react when you got engaged/married?,"I am currently engaged and living separate from my fiance, but when my mom knew the relationship started getting serious, she suddenly started not liking my fiance. She says that he’s gonna leave me one day and not to trust or rely on anyone but her. When the topic of me moving to live with him gets brought up, she just goes dead silent and doesn’t talk to anyone or changes the subject. 

I feel like the subject of me growing up and getting married is kinda like her grip is getting loose on me. She has even cried in front of me and said that she can’t control me anymore because I want to leave and is giving me a really hard time since he lives across the country. 

She says a man is supposed to leave his family when he gets married to be with the girl and her family, when in my culture and almost every other culture it is more common for the girl to leave her family. She picks and chooses what parts of our culture she wants to follow when it fits her narrative.

1o01b8q,Advice on wanting to go no contact with my mom after years of abuse and manipulation?,"I (late 30s, F) am struggling with a decision that feels both freeing and terrifying going no contact with my mother.

I’ve shared bits and pieces of my past on Reddit before, but lately, since becoming a mother myself, everything has hit me like a tidal wave. I’ve started remembering things more clearly, and I’m realizing how deeply my mom’s behavior has shaped (and damaged) me.

When I was little, my mom was physically abusive. She would choke me, slap me, pull my hair, or hit me when she was angry and then immediately twist it around as if I caused it. I still remember being maybe 7 or 8, her hands around my throat, screaming in my face because I “talked back.” Afterwards she cried and said she only did it because I “pushed her too far.”

That was her pattern. Everything she did was somehow my fault. If she screamed, it was because I “made” her angry. If she hit me, it was because I “needed to learn respect.” If I cried, I was “being dramatic.”

She never treated my siblings like that just me. And that made it worse, because it made me think something was truly wrong with me.

In public, she played a completely different role. She loved showing me off, calling me her “beautiful girl,” making sure I was dressed up, even in outfits that were way too mature for my age. People thought we were close. They thought she was this proud, doting mom. But it was all a show. Behind closed doors, I was the emotional punching bag, the scapegoat for whatever mood she was in that day.

She also overshared constantly. I knew things about her marriage to my dad that no child should ever know deeply personal, sometimes sexual, sometimes violent things. It made me grow up way too fast and gave me a warped sense of what love and family were supposed to look like.

One of the worst moments I can remember was in my late teens. We were in the car, arguing not even yelling, just me trying to calmly explain that something she said had really hurt me. Suddenly, she backhanded me across the face while driving. My head hit the window, and she just kept screaming. I remember the smell of her perfume, the sound of the car indicator clicking, and me sitting there in shock, staring straight ahead while she told me I was “lucky” she didn’t pull over and “teach me a real lesson.”

That’s the kind of person she is.

When I was eventually kicked out (because she hated my boyfriend at the time), it was another explosion. She punched me, ripped chunks of my hair out, and both her and my dad screamed vile things at me things no parent should ever say to their child.

Years later, I’ve tried to move forward. Therapy, forgiveness, keeping the peace. I even convinced myself maybe she’d changed. But becoming a mother has opened my eyes in ways I can’t describe.

I look at my baby this tiny, trusting little soul and I cannot fathom ever doing to him what she did to me. I can’t imagine hurting him and then telling him it’s his fault. I can’t imagine using his love against him, or mocking him, or making him feel small.

And that realization has broken something in me.

Now that she’s back in my life a little (visiting occasionally), her behavior has only confirmed everything. She ignores my boundaries, refuses to follow rules we have for our baby, undermines me as a parent, and constantly reminds me of “everything she’s done for us,” even though none of it was asked for.

My husband used to think I was overreacting. He didn’t know the full story I’d never told him everything. For years, I stayed quiet about the abuse because my mom told me not to tell him. She said, “If you tell him about me or our family, he’ll see how broken you are. He’ll realize you’re an awful person, just like me.” And I believed her. I carried that shame and stayed silent, protecting her image instead of my own truth.

But over time, things became impossible to hide. My husband saw how she talked to me the digs disguised as jokes, the passive-aggressive remarks meant to humiliate. Then extended family members started quietly sharing stories of how she treated me growing up.

Now, he finally sees her clearly. He tells me all the time that he can’t believe how kind, loving, and gentle I am after everything I went through. That I broke the cycle. That I’m an incredible mother nothing like her.

He’s been urging me to go no contact not just for my own mental health, but for our child. He doesn’t want our son growing up around that kind of manipulation and emotional abuse. He doesn’t want her holding him and when we are at family gatherings he will refuse it.

But I’m scared. She’s the type to twist everything. She’s always the victim. She overshares to everyone family, friends, even acquaintances to gain sympathy. If I cut her off, I know she’ll tell everyone I’m cruel, ungrateful, mentally unstable, whatever fits her narrative that week.

And there’s one thing that makes it even more complicated: the mortgage. It’s actually for them. She manipulated me into signing onto it years ago, convincing me it was a “temporary arrangement” to help the family. I was young and desperate for her approval, and I didn’t realize what I was getting into. Now I’m financially tied to her, and she uses it as leverage a constant reminder that I “owe” her, that I “wouldn’t have what I do” without her. It’s the one piece of control she refuses to let go of.

On top of that, she manipulates through guilt and fear. Whenever I try to set boundaries, she throws her health or mental state in my face. She’s told me before, “I’m sick because of the stress you cause,” or “If you stop talking to me, you’ll regret it when I’m gone.” She’s even claimed she’s tried to end her life because of me.

I feel trapped. Trapped between protecting my peace and the constant dread of what she’ll do if I finally step away for good. I want to be free, but I know the chaos she’ll unleash the smear campaign, the guilt, the emotional blackmail. I will still have to see her at family gatherings as our entire family and extended family are close (they tolerate her but don’t like her)

So Reddit, what advice could you give me on wanting to go completely no contact with my mom even though she’ll twist the story, try to destroy my reputation with family, and use the mortgage she manipulated me into signing as a way to keep controlling me?",Visual_Armadillo537,1759799842.0,4,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o01b8q/advice_on_wanting_to_go_no_contact_with_my_mom/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1o01b8q/advice_on_wanting_to_go_no_contact_with_my_mom/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False

1o00gix,Narcissistic (sort of) in-laws put a TRO on *me*,"Back in June my partner’s parents (we’re not married yet) moved in with us (not by our choice, but theirs/landlords…another long story). They were hostile from day one which escalated into events that culminated in my partner putting a temp restraining order on both of them, which we failed to get extended into a protective order due to a technicality: the abuse targeted mainly me not him. 

The landlord is their friend, so when they got served their temp restraining orders the landlord gave us notice to vacate. Immediately after the hearing that decided that, they put a temp restraining order onto me, that is actually based on what I said about them at the hearing and none of that happened to them at all. They even attempted to get one for my partner too but was denied. 

While I will definitely still fight this in court for the principle, I also don’t care much of the results since me and my partner will of course not be residing with them anyway after the fact. The things a restraining order would restrict me from doing (ex: not going any places they would be) I would already be doing anyway, and in fact my partner and I were planning on moving away soon before all this bs started.

1o003ww,"My mom exploded over something small again, and I’m starting to see a pattern","I’m 25 and living back at home with my mom who I believe is an undiagnosed narcissist. She has a habit of yelling at me, talking down to me, and bringing up my past to guilt or control me. And this past weekend really made me realize something might be wrong with her. 

Before moving back I told her I wanted a pet and discussed it with her and my sisters. Apparently even though she seemed supportive of the idea when it was brought up and has never said yes or no, when my sister brought a cat from work she completely went off the rails.

She snapped saying we don’t care about her, we care more about the cats than her, we don’t do anything, we are lazy and she might as well move out. I personally, got over letting her outburst like this bother me, but it really affects my sisters so we pretty much had to get rid of the cat. And that was fine. 

However the cat was staying until Sunday. I was out Saturday night and though even if it’s temporary I should get cat supplies and I called asking if it was fine to get litter and a bigger box just so she didn’t poop on my bedroom floor (the box she came with was too little). 

She again started snapping and I just hung up the phone because I didn’t want to hear that especially while I was out trying to enjoy my already crappy weekend. I came home and my sister told me to come back later because she was mad at me and wants me out the place I pay rent, bills and where my name is on the lease. She’s no ignoring me and pretty much trash talks me to my sisters. 

I’m honestly just trying to understand how to handle her without letting it destroy my mental health. Or if I should just cut ties because I’m mentally exhausted and unable to take this anymore. 


Update: I’ve decided I’m moving out at the end of our lease. This year has really been about cutting ties with both my parents and both sides of my family. It hurts more than anything to accept that, after all these years, my parents won’t be a part of my life anymore. But I’ve realized I have no place here… I never did.

I’m drained. I can’t talk to either of them like an adult because they both act like children. These past two years have felt like the longest of my life I’ve moved five times, and I’m desperate for stability. I’ve accepted that I’m not going to find that within my family.

1nzzthm,Attacked because I asked her to keep the peace,"I have posted before about my lovely mother and her random attacks that are attached to her ego. 

This behavior just gets worse a few days ago she started having chest pains that she has had in the past but she refused to go to a doctor but this time it got to the point that she couldn't move so against her will I called 911 and she was in the hospital for three days diagnosed with Afib and got prescriptions.

Then she came home Saturday, this is Monday everything was fine until I started looking for some state fair coupons my sister said she kept from last year and since Texas State Fair is expensive every coupon counts ya know? So mom was helping me look in her closet and admittly her room is a mess giant piles of clothes and stuff everywhere which of course is why she lost the coupons in the first place. 

Mom got mad and was going to jump on my sister and said she was going to throw away whatever clothes and plushies she didn't put away within like two days (which in moms brain means hide them and act like they don't exist we must live in an empty showroom devoid of any signs of life) I knew that was ridiculous and my sister would lose a lot of things that were important to her because my mom would just start chucking things. My sister and I were also planning to go to the fair Friday so the last thing I wanted to do was fight or worry about something that could be taken care of gradually later so I said ""I know but I don't want to fight please don't start a fight"" *bam* explosion she started screaming in my face throwing things on the floor saying whatever insult she could think of.

 She eventually locked herself in her room all day, but she left her medication that she was just prescribed out here and was refusing to open the door and said she wanted to die to hurt me. 

Eventually this led to her threatening to shoot me and just now hours after locking herself up she came and threatened me again and said if she could have found a gun earlier she would have killed me. All I did was ask for her not to start a fight, her response? Immediately start a fight and refuse to tell me why she's violently attacking me. After literally saying she would have shot me she acted like she was a victim and told me that if I ever ""got in her face"" she would throw me and my sister out. And apparently simply asking a question and expecting an answer in a normal voice is considered an attack and getting in her face and I was harassing her by doing so trying to get her to stop or come out of the room which i quickly gave up hours ago.

 I never got in her face, she got in my face immediately after she started yelling in fact I only yelled once in the hallway out of pure frustration because she wouldn't take her medicine. She attacked me and somehow I am in the wrong and I did it was all my fault. Oh and the Afib thing that is my fault to I make her have Afib attacks somehow because apparently I make her attack me or something. 

I asked her why and apparently that is also me attacking her somehow and she threatened to throw me out. All I can come up with is I was somehow undermining her authority to treat people however she wants no matter how horrible by asking her not to start a fight because the only thing she keeps saying is that ""she has no right to say what she wants but it's her house"" Just because your name is on the deed of the house doesn't mean you can just randomly violently threaten other people that are in it.

I am very tired and very stressed I can't exist in the same space as her anymore without the constant threat of attack with little to no explanation. I am still unemployed and I am getting so frustrated it's not even about money anymore it's about trying to find a way for me, my sister, and my pets to survive because my mom has officially lost it.

Description: The brow is furrowed intensely, indicating deep concern or anger, with lines etched horizontally across the forehead and vertically between the eyebrows. The eyes are narrowed slightly, giving a piercing, watchful gaze, and there's a certain tightness around them. The mouth is drawn downwards at the corners, forming a subtle frown, and the lips are pressed together firmly, suggesting displeasure or suppressed emotion. The overall impression is one of contemplative anger or intense jealousy, where the person is silently seething or deeply disturbed by something. There's a stiffness in the facial muscles, particularly around the jaw, which further emphasizes the intensity of the emotion

It feels like no one loves me and I don't love anyone in turn. My siblings and I love each other but it feels like that matters so little to me that it almost doesn't matter. Since they'll never be people I can confide in, just people I have a responsibility to look out for, they still feel like a burden, which makes me still resent them a little and not feel that close to them.

Slowly rebuilt over the years, he got to see his grandkids some. (Not much, just because Dad has always been more about the IMAGE of a happy family, than actually spending lots of time together.). We’ve been visiting him every 6-12 months for the last several years. 

We’ve had a long-distance, okay-ish relationship. He’s been focused on simplifying and end of life for the last few years, as he and his partner are getting old.

A few years ago, my brother died. Dad helped out with his things, and with legal arrangements. 

—— And, now —— 
This year I separated from my spouse (early 2025) and started the divorce process (this summer).

Dad emails me (47F) and son (17M) to make sure he’s got my new address right, and I think, “Oh, he’s going to send [son] a gift or something.”

Yeah, he sent something. An angry letter about how my (again, teenaged, and also OCD/ASD) son deeply hurt him - my Dad - the last time we visited. Which was 14 months ago.  I included the entire text of the letter, names and a nonessential detail or two omitted. 

—— Question ——
What…what on EARTH could have caused my Dad to suddenly chose this time - two weeks after spouse and I decided to divorce — to write my son and start a #%@^ flame war??

Theories welcome. Questions welcome.  

I’m not at a loss of what to do… son and I have individually written our letters.  Dad sent a follow-up email that’s just as bitchy and petty as you can imagine. (Just expand the letter below and you’ve got it.) 

And, he’s stopped answering the phone. I had to call the Sheriff’s department to do a wellness check on them yesterday. 


—— The letter —— 

Dear [OP’s son], 
I realize that changes are happening with your family dynamics, but something you said during your last visit has been bothering me ever since. You said something about ""... those snobs and all their rules. I'll just avoid them or do something to make their lives miserable."" That was hateful and mean.

[Dad’s spouse] and I are in that group of whom you spoke; we have many rules that we live by. We even have names for them. We call them manners, etiquette, politeness, consideration, kindness, respect, and other names, depending on the situation.

We learned these rules when we were children and have lived by them our entire lives. They were critical to our success in our chosen careers, [Dad’s spouse] in [career] and I in business. Even now we follow these rules as we interact with friends and others that we encounter as we go about our lives.

With this in mind, we are sending you a book about these rules. It is a children's book, because that is when we, and most others, learned them. We hope you will read it to get a better understanding of their purpose and application.

We do not believe that following these rules makes us snobs.

My mom has always made everything about herself, from me being bullied at 10 to me having a boyfriend at 17. Whenever I wanna stay over at his she'll assume its because shes a terrible mom and I wanna get away from her or worse, she'll start saying stuff like ""you're a slut"", ""it's clear what you'll be doing with him"" and just overall acting like I'm the kinda girl to let anyone fuck me (I'm not)(this is my first boyfriend ever lol). Recently it's getting really bad since she lost her job abt a month ago and everything I do is somehow connected to her. I started going to the gym with my bf - we fought because she thinks I'm an entitled brat for wanting them to sponsor me the gym (its 40 dollars a month)(they don't mind spending twice as much money on my lil borhter's playstation and xbox subsriptions). I asked her if she could make me breakfast when I was sick and she obviously had time - I'm once again acting like an entitled brat because when she was my age being sick didn't exist. Even when I got my OFFICIAL ADHD diagnosis she made it all about herself and how I'm trying to ""copy her adhd"" (she's self diagnosed). Even when it turned out I'm allergic to dish soap she bought (knowing I'm allergic to rose-like perfume) she still got mad at me and said this was my revange on her for something she made up. She makes up a lot of stuff to make me look spoiled and will then talk shit about me to my boyfriend when he's over and when I'd point it out that the x thing never happened she'd call me ""too stupid to understand"". Recently she also started very openly speaking that this is HER house. She went through my stuff, found my vibrator (I'm 17 so idk why its a shocker I own one lol) and when I got obviously mad she started going on how this is her house, I'm just living there (which like... what?) and that I'm not allowed to be upset with her looking through my things. The real breaking point was when she found my birthday money and just... took out 500 dollars. When I pointed it out she started talking about A  FREE doctor visit I had like a week ago and how this is my way of repaying her for litreally just going there with me (bc I'm not allowed to go to a doctor alone yet).

Both were in their mid forties. It was always going to be about Nmom and her insane delulu. 

I grew up with my dad’s extended family. We have all been divided since my teen years. 

Now I have my own family. I understand my siblings and their kids are off the table. My extended family are hours away. They never write, call or visit. I’m pretty sure they are infected too.

I told my husband I want to leave the country to experience other countries’ hospitality. I’ve built somewhat an extended family through chosen friends locally but it can be hit or miss. A lady friend even picked me up from surgery. 

I’m ready to leave the country. I don’t know what else to do. I’m thinking Eastern Europe or South America.

How can get over this entire thing of being a complete island / orphan outside my own family. My ILs are elderly and ill.

1nzvnln,Raised by a classical musician,"The car ride was always the same. Cramped backseat. Cold leather. Classical music blaring so loudly it was hard to think, let alone speak. Tchaikovsky, Mahler, Brahms. French horns screaming like they were angry too.
My mother, a classical musician by training, narcissist by damage, would drum along on the steering wheel, locked into the music, locked out of everything else. “Do-do-do-do, to-to-dooooo... “ she'd sing along with her own part, always her own part. French horn, of course.
It was just after she’d laid into me again — something about being a disappointment, a failure, a waste of her effort. Maybe I’d forgotten something. Or said the wrong thing. Or simply breathed wrong. She’d grabbed me by the hair once, maybe twice, in that same car. And then, without warning, she’d switch.
As the overture softened, as the strings came down and the horns prepared to rise — her voice would change too.
“Now here... here’s where the horns come in. Listen. This is where the strings meet the brass.”
Her tone would shift to something lighter. Her voice might even crack, just slightly. A softness she never offered me directly — only to the music. Only to herself. It was the only time I ever saw her sound almost... human.
I learned to watch those shifts. I became fluent in the language of her moods, her crescendos and decrescendos.

1nzueon,Dad won’t let me a get a part-time job,"I’m 15 and i live in ontario. I recently went to an interview for a retail position that would be twice a week on fridays and saturdays from 4pm-9:30pm. The manager wanted my Dad to confirm he could pick me up late, and my Dad was hesitant but he reluctantly said he’d let me do it despite being firmly against it at first. This was until my Math teacher called to let him know that I am far behind and because i don’t understand the material, and that I have not completed any work. Mind you, I am in grade 10 Academic Math and I know maybe 3 quarters of the grade 9 curriculum because I was struggling last year aswell. (However I did end up passing with a 70%). My teacher said I need to fully involve myself and get extra help, etc. Therefore, my Dad said, for the next couple of months I cannot take this Job. This is an issue because this Job most likely won’t be there, especially with a Manager who’s so understanding to my situation, in whatever my father deems as “a few months”. I really need this Job. I can no longer stand living with my family because it deteriorates my mental health. I seriously wouldn’t be able to keep going if I end up having to live in this household past the age of 18. Even more so, if I remain financially dependent on them for any longer. Half of the time I don’t even have all my hygiene stuff, or they take away my phone at any time over small things for MONTHS, hindering any contact outside my home besides for the few friends I have on snapchat because my school has provided me a chromebook. They don’t even give it back to enable me to speak to my therapist. Meanwhile they argue with me, call me names, and don’t let me go out. They buy my younger siblings 3 water bottles each, but I still remain with the same beaten up one from middle school. I am supposed to wear prescription glasses (which are covered by insurance), but I can’t because my parents won’t go and get them. My family is so exhausting and insufferable to be around, they keep going from “happy” one day, to a full fledged war the next. I so desperately need to start saving up to move out, and I have no pocket money or any means to finance myself independently. My parents do not give me any money whatsoever, maybe once in a blue moon if I ask and they’re somewhat happy with me. They don’t have much money theirselves and they are in debt, apparently struggling to pay for even groceries. Anywho, I was feeling so hopeless and even slightly suicidal before this Job opportunity and I really need it but I cannot get it without my father’s approval. I seriously do not know what to do. I can catch up in Math and I just got myself a grade 12 tutor provided by the school. It may take some time for me to catch up with school entirely, but me having or not having this job will not affect that in any way at all. It most likely will negatively impact my mental health, furthermore inhabilitating my success in school. 

I’ve messaged my school social worker, and I’ve messaged my aunt for advice. I’m going to try and see if the social worker could help me try and speak to my Dad. Unfortunately, my Mum is under my Dad’s “Control” aswell. Therefore, she says she has no say. Ive messaged the employer to see if I can work without my father’s permission and I’m waiting on a text back. What should I do?

I’m (F29) who recently moved out of the house I was sharing with my mother (long story — lots of dysfunction), but unfortunately I’m still tied to that lease for a little while longer. So even though I don’t live there anymore, I’m still paying rent, Wi-Fi, electricity, and even my mother’s phone bill. I’ve been trying to just keep the peace until the lease ends, and then I’ll be completely free.

But recently, my mother stole from me.

I had a check delivered to the house — my check, in my name — and instead of letting me know it arrived, she opened my mail and had her boyfriend deposit it into his account. Then she lied to my face several times, swearing she never saw it. It wasn’t until I contacted her boyfriend directly that I got the money back. Turns out he didn’t know the full story and returned the money once I told him what was going on.

The crazy part? She was angry that he gave it back.
Said she “needed the money.”

No apology. No accountability. Just guilt games and silent phone calls.

It’s been a wake-up call. I’ve always tried to help her — paid bills, helped with paperwork, supported her through her health issues — but this was the final straw. I’m done. I’m going full no contact once the lease ends. The only reason there’s even a thread of connection right now is because of my younger sister, who I’m trying to protect from the same emotional abuse.

(TW: weight talk bc my mom's crazy),"So I had to ask for something from Costco, my medicine because it's cheaper and I get more there and she wanted me to go with her and I was like I haven't hung out with her in a few days maybe it'll be fine sometimes we have good outings and other times we don't? Idk

So the whole thing starts by her crying to me because I don't come upstairs to hang out with her every day (this situation is exactly why) and I was like ok? Then she asks me to leave my disability aids at home because she thinks they're distracting (ive told her multiple times they're necessary) and I said no because it's fucking Costco. Eventually we get there and every time I comment on snacks I like she tells me they're so bad for me and buying them would be ""enabling"" me because well, I'm fat right so I must be unhealthy (I have physical proof that I'm perfectly healthy and she thinks I'm just lying to myself so). I let those go because like they're gonna happen no matter what she's just insanely fatphobic and refuses to acknowledge it. But then she starts making comments about my chronic illness and about how I'm just lazy when I physically can't do the things she's talking about, again I was like she's weird AF but if I spend all my energy being mad I'll have a bad day and that's not worth it. I truly thought she was done, but I decided to buy two slices of pizza and then she started making all the comments about how she thinks I'm dying and I'm not prioritizing my health and how ""people who prioritize their health don't get pizza"" as if I'm not allowed to eat food??? So I was like hey listen I'm taking care of my body in my own way, you assume I'm not because I'm not doing it how you would and she was like why would I assume that and I said genuinely idk because there's nothing that would cause that assumption (besides her own bias but I'm not saying that) and I don't think she understands how her words hurt? Or maybe she does and she thinks she has to say the things I've told her hurt me because she thinks she's saving me? I'm just like it's insanely rude to assume I'm not taking care of myself and it's like wtf dude like genuinely the things she says to me about my weight and food choices, entirely unprompted, I can usually just brush off but like today it's like she was insinuating that my chronic illnesses happened because of my own choices when they literally didn't?? 

Also just what's up with adults thinking they can make rude as fuck comments unprompted without any kind of negative reaction like it's so out of pocket and unnecessary especially because I've told her to stop doing that shit it's rude?

It’s a very heavy job that includes customer service and thorough details with everything and I thought it would be a good way to start saving money because I got this job during the summer and my relative there seems to be handling well while studying too.

What I really didn’t expect was the job itself is very draining from the way you have to keep up with the pace and details without mistakes while simultaneously tolerating people you don’t understand or have miscommunication with, especially as someone who’s very introverted. I realized far sooner that it’s not for me and as much as I really tried to hold on despite the good pay, it wasn’t it worth how I kept questioning myself and having mental breakdowns from the slightest to biggest mistakes I make at work.

It wasn’t around this month that I decided to just resign and have a peace of mind after hellish two recent shifts and 3 months in, I ended up crying the whole day after that I couldn’t hold it in front of my dad. (Short backstory: me and my parents are not that close since they were absent during half of my childhood year and too busy working overseas to provide while I was handed my relative who ruined my perception of healthy relationship and self image) 

He ended up venting about everything to him: how I compare myself, I make many mistakes, and the peer pressure. He listened really good and advised me really well with his own experience that he quit some jobs early too until I made him promised to not tell my mother yet because she’s the kind of person to probably trespass the place and demand explanation that will cause trouble, of course I didn’t want to feel embarrassed and I want to be the one to tell her I resigned to focus on school.
 
That is, until I saw a message between them that my father already told on me before I could get to. Surprisingly, my mother was much against it and just told me to talk to my manager and how I’ll become an early quitter at my future jobs plus how she’s thinking about reaching out to one of my co-workers to let her know and reassure me when she clearly knows I’m afraid of conflict due to trauma. I felt my stomach dropped and just betrayed overall and now I fear she’ll contact my manager about it when I just want to quit in peace.

Am I overreacting??

I know I didn't do anything wrong, they're the one who sexually assaulted me several times. I am a victim, even though I am not perfect, I never abused them. Why am I doubting myself?

1nzqkx2,I never thought this day would ever arrive............,"I genuinely can't believe it. I'm going away from my nparents to attend med school. I'll be living in a hostel, away from them. I'm packing my bags as I type this.


Of course, there are caveats to this:

1) I'd actually gotten a seat in a med school farther away from home, but my parents turned it down and forced me to go to a nearer one. This made me so mad, but all I could do was bottle it up. And of course, the gotcha line to shut me up was ""Don't you love your parents?""

2) I still have to go back home once every week or two. So yeah, it's not like I'll never see them ever again. At their insistence of course.


But even with both of these caveats, I'll be away from them for the first time in my life. This is the last night I'll be under their thumb............at least for the time being.


I don’t even have words.

The movie didn't have jump scares by any means; it just contained going from silence to a sudden loud moment, and it was in these moments that I would literally jump in my seat. When I took a look around, everyone was simply enjoying the movie and didn't seem to be affected by any actions.

The noise ""jump scares"" would take me back to the lashing out episodes I had to endure from my Ndad with raging anger issues. I felt so embarrassed being the only person showing a visible reaction and not maintaining a stoic face.

1nzohg6,"Brother tried to poison me, family goes on as usual.","Hi. The title pretty much said it all. I posted elsewhere about this , so ill spare all the details, but i believe my brother tried to poison me with rubbing alcohol. It probably wouldn't have killed me, but i think it would've made me sick. 

I told mom and grandfather about it, and i basically got 🤷‍♀️. Mom was more or less like, ""Oh, Did he?"" and went about her day. Grandpa told me not to leave my drink unattended. 

My brother has always been mom's favorite child despite all the bad things hes done (like armed robbery). My brother resents me a lot. He hates that I told my mom that I would hit her if she ever hit me first. He told me that i should just let her hit me because shes the mom. He told me that i needed to be resilient against her like a soldier is resiliwnt against a drill sergeant. This was his actual comparison. 

He thinks she can take me in a fight. She is over 50, badly out of shape. I have been into fitness for over 20 years. In fact, she always discouraged me from doing fitness, but i never let it phase me. They both ganged up in me and called me a brat at our last family blow up. 

My brother dislikes me very much in part because I go against mom's wishes. Despite her I became a strong, person who does many different things like workout, read, and dance with fire. She hates everything i do that she wouldn't do. I learned early that I had to go against her for my own sanity. 

Anyways, im glad I have someone to talk to. Yes, I love with my grandfather in a multigenerational home. My brother stole what was a konths rent from me and never paid me back entirely, think $100 out of the $1100 he stole. Many landlords nowadays have a triple rent rule. I lost my only friend. I dont have a boyfriend or husband I can run to. I tried to run to a man years ago, and he ended up being a lot like my mother.

1nzofvm,Just venting,"Hey there, to anyone reading this, just wanted to vent out in an open space. It's all very stuffy and suffocating right now, always has been but reallll bad today. I really need this off.

So, I was the world's greatest insufferable mommy lover. I loved my mother more than anything in the world. I remember having these full on meltdown fight because a girl at school remotely said something about my mom ( don't even remember)

You can understand my horror when the realization hit me that it's actually all just one sided love. No my mommy dearest doesn't love me unconditionally. Infact, there are so many conditions to her love, they dimmed the living lights out of me.

And it's all well before I ever had the internet on my hands or I ever shared with my friends about it. I often got some remarks from ignorant fools saying the internet brainwashed me and echo chambers can do that to you but nooo. 
The unripe old age of 4 and I saw my mother slap, pull my hair, ostracize me, and kick me out of my litter ( she purposefully showered love on my brother and sister for an entire week while cursing me profanities, what can a 4 year old possibly do😭😭) all because she had a fight with my father and she saw me cozying up to him ( how dare I not understand, when she's angry with someone, I have to be too)

Her attitude would obviously very flippantly change back to the loving, sacrificial mother, who is a martyr. Part of the reason, why it took me so long to really see through her bipolarish behaviour and even resent her because I used to think it would be a sin to think any ill of this lady, the lady who did her duty of motherhood to the T.

Anyways the blind has been off for a long while now, and I was just reminiscing about just how much of a naive, young trusting girl I was, to look up to my mother as the pinnacle of love. Poor me.

So the current rift right now between me and her is about *cough* boys *cough*. 
Context: I'm 22 years old now, have never had a bf for this very same reason that I have a giant bomb sitting right at home who would make my life a living hell, if she ever finds out and I kinda don't want to put whoever my potential partner to go through so much of secrecy, like it would have to be militia level top secret and that's exhausting for me, of all people.

I've had romantic experiences but I always had to cut them in the nib and be nope nope, yup I can't hope more than this.

So despite never having a bf, never having kissed, hold hands, count anything romantussy, I am constantly slut shamed. Like now I think, I should HAVE been in relationships, damn taking the heat for no reason, atleast make it worthwhile, you shaming me.

Saying I'm a whore for hanging out with boys ( there's one guy in my friend group, in a group of 3 girls for God's sake) and she somehow found out my friend's public insta account and saw all of our group's pictures ( I never share anything with her, she doesn't know Jack shit about my social life, grey rocking the entire time) and now I have to sit through this daily ordeal of "" Go sleep with your friend"", ""Selling your bodies at hotels"" ( she saw us hanging out at a Korean BBQ restaurant, a college group of 8-9 people, about which she knewwww).

It's so frustrating to get stuck up with this hyper ultra pro conservative parent who won't let you breathe around the opposite gender. I see other kids my age whose parents are chilled and relaxed about such mundane stuff and I see them sailing through in their social life like cool breeze.

And it all the more makes my relationship with people pop put in ugly contrast, me the awkward being who thinks 20 things before interacting with peers my age. I hate that my mother's incessant censure and hold and bleeding in my life has locked me in a mental cage. There isn't one I know and I am like say 0.5 percent better than what I was before ( I constantly try to be my cheerleader) but goddamn are some people sooooo unfit to be raising kids.

I've tried to bring these topics up in civil manner, but my mother's tendency to fly into rage and derail the topic leads me nowhere with her, which just makes me resentful, and I've lost all hope and love for her.

It's not about boys. I could care less at a point about that.

Yesterday it was about how I take my tea a certain about way.

Day before about the haircut I did on my own violation ( she didn't like it of course)

Tomorrow it will be about why I have a personality and not the version she imagined me to be. To the T.


It feels a bit better now. 
My mom's still in the other room bitching about me to my siblings. Lol

This helped me drown out the noise, if anyone may need this.

I had deep effects from that psychologically and socially. Cant begin to speak what things he did and i absorbed everything and i somehow attracted all the guys like him in my life.

1nzno2u,Feeling overwhelmed by my abusive parents and lost about what to do,"I’m 20-something, living in India. I grew up in an extremely abusive household. I have proof that my dad sexually abused me when I was younger. My mom didn’t believe me for years until she found out he was cheating on her. Since then she’s been more “supportive” but still guilt-trips me about my life choices (smoking, drinking, going out) instead of acknowledging the damage done.

I’ve been in therapy, but my therapist isn’t available this week and I’m in a really dark place. My dad is pressuring me to celebrate his birthday with him soon. I don’t even feel excited about my own birthdays anymore because I’m nowhere near where I thought I’d be in life.

I started smoking and drinking to survive the pain. Without it I honestly don’t know if I’d still be here. I know how harmful it is, but right now it’s what keeps me alive day to day. Please don’t tell me to “just quit” — I’m already aware of the risks.

I don’t have a safe house to go to, no other family who will take me in, and only a small handful of friends. Even those friendships sometimes feel like people are using me or drifting away.

Right now I feel stuck, worthless, and like the world would benefit if I disappeared. But a small part of me still wants to live, heal, and find real care. I’m trying to hold on to that.

I don’t know what to do about my dad’s birthday. Should I go? Should I stay away? Should I get a tattoo, run away, anything? I’m so lost. Any support, advice, or even just a kind word from people who’ve survived similar families would mean a lot.

(Please no harsh judgment about my coping methods — I’m just trying to stay afloat.)

1nznmql,Realization you might find useful,"Long story short, my mom and dad are both addicts and different strains of narcissists. I’ve done 13 years of therapy and read tons of books on fawning, codependency and basically have been focused on what I can do to manage my side of things both past and present. So I am now engaged to a man whose mother is incredible in all the ways I’ve wished for in a mother. His mother is like a prayer answered and provides such a sense of normalcy, predictably and strength. 

This past week, I was really sick so a couple days ago, I mentioned this to my MIL. Immediately, she said she’d make me some homemade chicken noodle dumpling soup and would drop it off at our house which she did. I kept thanking her and was so touched by her responsiveness. 

Cut to several days later, today, I get a text from my dad who’s an extremely emotionally immature type narcissist. He guilt trips me with how I haven’t seen him in so long, etc. (it’s been 3 weeks since I’ve seen him and he forgot he made plans to come over, never came over yet it’s my fault ie I haven’t seen HIM). I say I am really sick, several plans had to be rescheduled, so I’m busy this week and can’t come over, basically. He texts back “sad”. I say “what”. He responds “is it really going to take you that long to get over being sick? I feel like you are punishing me and it hurts”. Long story short (again, lol): my parents smokes inside the house with my special needs dependent sister and I’ve begged them for 5 years to stop. They stop smoking inside then boom, surprise, they start again and it starts a fight and round we go on the merry go round. So About 3 weeks ago, I stopped over at my parents house and boom, surprise, there’s my dad smoking a joint with his cigarette trashcan next to him and an ashtray with cigarettes. I communicate to him how I will not let this go ever, I will advocate for a smoke free environment for my sister and how selfish it is to smoke inside when outside is literally right there. I calmly express to him that he is straining our relationship severely by smoking inside. 

When I was single and only had my family to interact with, because a sense of family is meaningful to me, while I had boundaries, I also constantly made concessions. Reading books like “Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents” were a god send for me but in retrospect, it was hard to practice what I was learning since narcissists are always baiting you into testing boundaries. 

Today, when my dad texted me, it was so interesting, almost in the form of a case study, of how he responded to me being sick versus my MIL. My MIL’s caring gesture, follow through and focus on me was really meaningful because I am so used to something more along the lines of my dads response which was basically “can’t you get over being sick sooner so you can see ME? You haven’t seen ME in so long.” And I thought wow, the emotional neglect, when there’s nothing else to replace it with, is really hard to be honest about. Conversely, when I have someone like my MIL who responds with care to my needs, even then, it’s hard to see and feel what goes on with both my parents but I can at least anchor to the goodness in my life, being treated decently and ask for that treatment with my parents. Even if I fail, like how they say they won’t smoke inside and then do, I feel so much stronger and so much less guilt sticking to my guns and letting there be some consequences. The more I learn and the more I zoom out and use the tools I’ve learnt as an adult, I see my parents dysfunction less about me and more as their norm that I will never allow to be mine again. 

So I just wanted to post that if you’re dealing with a narcs baiting or emotional neglect, I hope you have someone in your life who treats you with basic care and dignity. I hope you have something or someone to look forward to. If you feel you don’t, I hope you can give yourself that basic care and dignity, big or small. I hope you don’t get lost in the maze of the endless drama of the narc. My dad seems to live to be the victim and usually, I argue with him how he’s wrong but it’s such a waste of time… Our lives were impacted by our narcs but if we’re here, if you’re reading this, I think that’s a great sign and means you’re fighting for something different for you.

1nzmhgv,PTSD diagnosis ended in parental estrangement,"I guess this has been a long time coming. Going to therapy just sealed the deal.

I finally got some affordable therapy! I went to therapy and got diagnosed with PTSD. (CPTSD isn't in the DSM yet, but my symptoms mirror CPTSD more.) I revealed the things that happened to me to the therapist and she, thankfully, actually believed me and validated that it was abuse and hard to deal with. Anyway, definitely have CPTSD, right?

I was really contemplating whether or not to bring it up to the person who (I believe) caused it. I finally did, very respectfully and tentatively. I simply said, ""hey, I know you need me. But I might need to take some space here soon. I'm going through some stuff in therapy and it's brought up some hard feelings towards you. I've been diagnosed with PTSD."" When they, of course, asked why, I said, ""Do you think that you had an unhealthy/obsessive relationship with my body growing up? I remember some things and it's making me feel gross/ashamed now. But what do you think?""

They got SO mad. So defensive. ""I have no words. I never abused you."" Just kept repeating that. Also saying ""my parent did it to me, what can I say, I can't remember, what do you think I did, I'm so far along in my recovery (they go to a 12 step program) that I don't remember anything. But if you need something from me so you can heal, let me know what I can do."" I told them I wanted to work through it to get closer, but since they're making me feel crazy I'll have to take some space. Then they just descended into their religion, saying they're sorry I have PTSD, they'll pray to Jesus for me to get better, etc.

Anyway. Yeah. Stopped talking to me, it's been the silent treatment from both parents ever since. My other parent tried to call me that night but I was too heartbroken and ashamed to answer. The next day they made a group chat with my extended family and included me in it, but then started planning this huge vacation with a number of hotel rooms that left me out. Not that I care, but still. Crazy.

I know it's not AITA, but am I being the a-hole for not reaching back out? It feels like if I do, I'm confirming that I'm insane and falling back into their illusion. Begging for forgiveness, for being honest and rupturing the illusion of my perfect childhood. Being estranged kind of feels good, it feels like I'm myself and strong, but it's also really heartbreaking. Whose responsibility is it to reach out first? I mean, shouldn't they care more than this since I'm their kid and I said I have PTSD??

And then of course there's always the possibility that I AM crazy, did imagine everything, and am therefore doubly the a-hole for not reaching out to apologize. But my therapist said to trust my body and I'm trying.

(I posted this in r/CPTSD too, I hope it's okay, I just want people to talk to about this because I'm acting normal in real life but I'm actually very sad).

During COVID and another localised event my sister reached out and very much started panicking about my well being and tried to imply that my life is in danger and that I should be careful. I know the words coming out of her mouth are my mother’s. I am wondering if any of you had this experience and if it’s a thing?

Yeah when most people say they are worried about your well being it’s a nice thing. But with my toxic family it feels like they want something bad to happen to me and that they keep saying they are worried about me to make me feel small and helpless.

1nzm09f,I hate the way trauma and abuse have blunted and alienated my family and the way they don't feel or act like a family,"My family are narcissists and alcoholics (I have 2 aunts and an uncle my mum died when I was 10) my Nan from what I can tell was abusive to one of my aunts and had low level BPD and depression because she seemed to fit the criteria with mood swings, splitting episodes, threatening to leave home every other week etc my Granddad was also cold and not a particularly sympathetic father one such case involves my aunt having some of her teeth removed at 18 and him complaining that he had to get a train to London where she was working to bring her home but didn't give her one ounce of sympathy at the time. I realise times were different back then but my family are warped due to this and the suicide of my mother back in 2001, no good has come from the ""onwards and upwards"" motto NONE.

We never go anywhere we never do ANYTHING, no restaurants, no holidays, birthday celebrations are always at my aunt's house or my other aunt's house and they're forced and dull as fuck, they've gone from seeing each other once a month or once every couple of weeks to seeing each other a handful of times in a year, they never talk about anything remotely interesting it's like in The Bear when the mum's boyfriend confronts the older brother and says you never have any new stories to tell you keep telling the same stories over and over my family do this and it's exhausting, they can only stand maybe 2 or 3 hours in each other's company and they all shout over each other to try and get a word in edgeways it's like being at a zoo or something they only ever ask about each other's work and that's it, their alcoholism has isolated them specifically my aunt and her husband who cut me out in December of last year because I told them they needed to take a gas leak in their house seriously (I'm not even joking with this) they brag about how they only want to do a ""solo Christmas"" they make out everything is effort they've always made out everything is effort like the years we used to go to my other aunt's house for Christmas and stuff, when I lived in my first home at 24 they didn't bother to visit me or anything I was working at the time as well and I found the time to see my friend and my friend found the time to see me my aunt said I ""moved too far away"" but my friend literally got on numerous buses to come see me and where I lived was at best 15 mins down the road. My aunt and her husband go on the same cruises every single year never somewhere different it's always the same, my other aunt has only ever taken her kids on holiday to France but that's literally it my family aren't exactly scraping the pennies they just live in a bubble and think they don't need to go anywhere else I guess?

I'm worried this type of isolated and narrow minded thinking of ""we don't need to go anywhere we don't need to experience anything new"" and thinking that the bare minimum is more than enough is starting to happen to my sister, she like my family has become addicted to working non stop every time I talk to her she's got a new project on the horizon, she's making or writing something but she's doing this so much it's become an obsession, she went to her first festival this year and she's pushing 40 even my Dad was perplexed about this it's not like she's never had the friends or the money to go with this festival was spontaneous it wasn't even planned, her husband said he couldn't stand the idea of going to a festival without being drunk so idk if she's copied him in that sense?? She won't go anywhere new that isn't within the area code of where she lives and COMPLAINS if she has to go outside of it like she's on fucking tag or something and she says she's got kids but her kids are both 10 and 7 them being in a car journey for what maybe an hour isn't going to kill them they've got Ipads and tablets to be entertained with and they wouldn't be neglected or anything because my sister is a good mum, I suggest we go to restaraunts, places with her kids, family days out and if its not within the Kent area she point blank refuses, in the past I've suggested we go on holiday together and she's shunned it saying once again that's she got kids and it's complicated but other people go on holidays together and they have kids don't they?? She's never even been abroad with her kids and again it's not like she hasn't got the money she's had money here and there my Dad just gave her a grand and she chose to pay a credit card off meaning she has £30 a month extra going spare which is smart but at the same time it's only an extra £30 and she could have used that money to put down for a deposit on a family holiday or something even her husband is upset they've never been abroad with their kids.

I have no right to tell anyone how to live but I just hate this I see so many festivals, different restaraunts, fun things to do I get excited and I suggest them to her but she shuts me down and gives me the ""you don't have kids you don't understand"" speech like having kids equals jail sentence or something, she also won't watch any movies or tv shows I recommend but gets funny if I don't watch the things she's recommended to me 🫤.

My family don't even make excuses for why they never go anywhere or do anything new they just don't mention it, I used to think they were an exciting fun family but omg the older I get the more I realise how boring and shut off they are and as someone who wants adventure and to actually make the most of life I can't stand this way of thinking, again if it was money related I'd understand but my family do very well for themselves even my sister earns more than my boyfriend and he's a gas engineer. Idk I hate seeing how other people do stuff with their family, have bonding experiences, happy memories etc I have 2 memories of family holidays in the last 30 odd years and they were both disastrous and all my family did were get drunk, argue and abuse me. Its like they don't know how to function or be anything resembling a family they just treat it like it's a chore that needs to be done and they bury themselves in their jobs.

1nzlkd6,"Escaped, but lost without the chaos...","TW: narcissistic abuse, physical abuse, substance abuse, sexual coercion

This is about my narcissistic partner, not my parents, however, it feels like I was raised by this person as I am completely brainwashed and left in the dark.

Total honesty here as I feel like we’re all in the same situation and I’m glad this is being posted anonymously. I have been abused by a (superstar) narcissist for 2.5 years, every day. Hit, locked up, passport burned, manipulated in the most dark ways, being told I was no one, talentless, ugly. Bottles thrown on me and being forced to have intercourse with this person in it covered in bl00d. Kicked me out of hotel rooms every night, suitcase thrown out of the window (this happened weekly). Got intoxicated by the abuser and woke up with abusers name tattooed on my arm. Forced to drink every day, do blow every day, to keep up this superior lifestyle of this person. At the end, I had no more self esteem, I did not know who I was anymore. I disappeared. I decided to check in to a rehab center where they told me I have very bad trauma and that this whole period I was numbing myself with alcohol not to feel the pain, I never really drank before being with this person. I am out now, but I am so lost. Who am I without this chaos, who am I without the devil next to me that I miss so much, but hate so much as well. I dream about us every night, I don’t have any car ride without staring into the sky and thinking about everything that I went through. When am I finally going to be normal again? I had a date a few weeks ago and I was bored after 5 minutes, because I was missing the mind games.

I hope there’s people under us that can give me a bit of advise, I’m having weekly therapy but I just feel that I am nobody. ❤️

1nzlfmx,"Children of Dysfunctional Families: What toxic 'role' (the 'son they never had,' the 'therapist,' the 'fixer,' the 'liable Scapegoat') did you have to adopt to earn conditional love, and what was the moment, or the single sentence, that finally caused you to break the performance?","I wish I only had one, but both of my parents wanted a shot at breaking me:


​My father called me his 'son' because I had finally found the way to make myself useful to him: I was a replacement for the boy he never had, and therefore, I was safe. To seal that twisted friendship, I had to lie, pretending I used drugs just so he would let me into his world.
​That night, snorting cocaine with him in the Wal-Mart parking lot, I learned the most devastating lesson of my childhood: Love is conditional, and the currency of my father's approval was my compliance with his corruption.

​This event didn't just expose me to drugs; it solidified the 'Son Persona'—the belief that my true self, the sensitive girl who felt uncomfortable, was worthless. My body was a threat to him, so I had to become a tomboy and a co-conspirator to survive. It shaped me into 'Little Miss Helpful'—the tireless satellite who would do anything, even dangerous, illegal things, to earn a moment of non-threatening connection. The price of admission to my own family was losing myself.


​
​My mother's moment was a breaking point where the lie I had been living finally shattered. My mother was sobbing, blaming me for her C-section scar, for 'hurting her' even in the womb. That single sentence—'Even in my womb you wanted to hurt me'—summarized my existence to her: I was not a daughter, but a liability, a walking injury, and the cause of her suffering.

​For years, I played 'Little Miss Helpful,' striving to be good enough, invisible enough, or helpful enough to counteract that inherent 'damage.' But when I finally shouted, 'You care more about your marriage than your daughters!,' it was the first time my authentic self spoke the truth of my childhood.

​This event shaped me by showing me two things: First, that the emotional truth, no matter how pure, would be instantly rejected and weaponized by them. Second, and most crucially, it was the first time I prioritized my own reality over their illusion. It was the genesis of the person who would eventually have the courage in slow motion to leave my family behind to finally find myself.

And, now I have BPD.

1nzlbza,I’m thinking of talking to my mom again… are these reasonable boundaries?,"I’m meeting with my mom on Thursday to discuss my boundaries, and if she agrees, I’ll let her be apart of my life again. I wrote all of these down a while ago, and I’ll provide some explanation in brackets if necessary. For context, I’m 23 and I’ve been living on my own for over a year now. I’ve had no contact with my mom for about a year and a half. 

1. I’ll talk to you when I feel like it. I don’t have to text you unless I want to. I won’t answer any questions that I don’t feel comfortable answering. I won’t see you in person if I don’t feel like it. 

[My mom is quite stubborn and if she wants to know something, she’ll keep pushing me and won’t give in until I’m crying. She won’t drop a topic if I ask her to. She’ll demand I see her or visit and try and guilt trip me.] 

2. You don’t have access to my location. You won’t know where I live. I don’t have to tell you where I’m going, or with who. You won’t have Life360. This also includes coming over or showing up someplace uninvited. If I feel like seeing you, I’ll let you know. 

3. You won’t tell me how to practice my faith. If I say I don’t want to attend a church service with you, I won’t. I don’t care to discuss my practices with you. My faith and how I practice is very important to me (as it is to you). God knows my heart and I don’t owe you any explanation. 

[I’d still consider myself a Christian, but recently I’ve gotten more into meditation and witchcraft. She found some of my things in my bedroom, and tossed them in the trash because she thought they were “satanic”. Things that I’d purchased with my own money and valued. It was just herbs and crystals and some incense. She also guilt trips me or says I’m going to hell if I don’t attend church with her.] 

4. Certain topics will not be discussed. In particular, politics, religion, or what substances I decide to use will not be talked about. I am an adult that’s capable of making my own decisions, and some things we will have to disagree on. I’ll also have the right to say “I don’t want to talk about this anymore” and I will expect you to drop the topic. 

[My mom is very heavily a right-wing supporter. I’d consider myself a centrist. We disagree on lots of things politically and sometimes I just wish she’d respect the fact that I’m my own person with my own views and opinions. I also enjoy a nice, LEGAL edible every now and again. I’m not huge into alcohol tbh, but my mom thinks that taking an edible you find at a vape store makes me a drug addict.] 

5. I don’t want to be posted on your socials. I appreciate my privacy and I expect you to respect this as well. If you wish to tell me you’re proud, wish me a happy birthday, or feel the need to say anything similar. I would rather you tell me to my face. 

[I’ve never heard my mom say that she’s proud of me. She always posts it on Facebook for her friends to see so they think we’re a perfect happy family. I’m sick of the disingenuousness, and I just want a parent that’ll tell me these things to my face.] 

6. I want an apology. A real, genuine apology. Not an “I’m sorry that you feel that way” or “I’m sorry that happened” but a true and sincere “I’m sorry that I did…”. I need you to take accountability for things you’ve done that have hurt me. I will also expect an apology from [brother’s name] and [my grandmother]. I’ve been alienated from my family for over a year, all because you’ve drug my name through the dirt. I won’t let anyone back into my life that doesn’t respect me enough to recognize when they’ve hurt me. 

[This is the big one. I was abused for 7 years by her ex-husband. She watched it happen, she watched my mental health decline and she did nothing. My siblings were abused as well, and I just want her to tell me she’s sorry for not doing anything about it. I would also beg for therapy, but she was jealous that I wouldn’t talk to her about things. I told her I was suicidal and she noticed and even asked about SH I had on my body. She just never cared, and was more concerned with her jealousy and love life instead of her children’s well being. She never initiated the divorce either, he had an affair and left her.] 

Sorry if all of this is long or confusing. I want to give my mom a chance but it’s so scary. I’ve been working hard this past year on getting myself into a good place and finding my own peace. I don’t want to disturb any of my progress. My mental health is at an all time high (I’m 10 months clean from SH) and I’m so very very proud of myself.

Thank you for letting me rant, and feel free to ask any questions if needed!

1nzl2gy,My NPD Mom Joked About My Worst Childhood Trauma,"One of my worst childhood trauma was revealed in one of my recent ayahuasca retreats. It was about when I was very little (3 or 4?) and I was really not companied by adults plus in bad health, so I didn't understand body signaling me its time to poop or sometimes I just couldn't hold it. That being said, I shit my pants a lot and ofc my mom had to wash them. She didn't do a good job teaching me how to understand my body or cared for my intestine health, but rather just shamed me over and over for it. 

  
One day I did it again, and I guess she was having a bad day, she lashed it all out on me, in a VERY VERY BAD WAY. she picked up a thick wooden stick and beat my ass so many times and for so long until the stick broke into half. I dont have any memory of that exact event (I guess my brain is protecting me from it), all I can remember was I was so badly injured that I couldn't sit for over a week and and had to sleep butt up for longer. I was so traumatized so after that event whenever I feel any stomach movements (as light as digestion movement or even some tiny gas) I would storm to the toilet  freaking out I would shit my pants again. 

  
As I grew up, I have always had this uncontrollable tight clutch in my private parts which created enormous problem for my regular life and sex life. But since this is too private, I dont even know who to talk to, and for decades I thought that was normal and thought it was all IN MY HEAD. 

  
The other day, my mom just casually joked about that event, saying how she beat me so bad and broke the stick, because she ""had no other choices"" and it was so ""Effective"" I stopped shitting my pants. I instantly froze and couldn't talk cuz my body was in shock and fight/flight mode. She didn't notice anything as always and moved to other topics but I left the room quickly and had a big big breakdown. 

  
I confronted her later on and had many other arguments, eventually I 100% cut them off but thats another story.....",No-Cauliflower-8082,1759761968.0,164,0.99,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1nzl2gy/my_npd_mom_joked_about_my_worst_childhood_trauma/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1nzl2gy/my_npd_mom_joked_about_my_worst_childhood_trauma/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1nzl1cy,Finally had the guts to cut my mom off for good last week after she tried to make my grandma pass away all alone.,"
First and foremost, I discovered this community 12 years ago and it was life changing for a kid like me who felt all alone with what I was dealing with. Forever grateful for that day in my room where I “dry sobbed” (couldn’t risk my mom hearing me and giving her a reason to verbally attack me that day) when I stumbled across this sub. I’m finally here to post for the first time as I’ve finally broken free. 

So much I could write but then this post would turn into a book. My mom would absolutely be diagnosed true NPD if she ever got evaluated. The absolute most disgustingly deplorable person I’ve ever known, right next to my stepdad. I’ve even been able to overcome falling for narcissistic friends and romantic relationships and learning to not accept that behavior anymore after it being normalized in my childhood, but I always figured my mom would be the “final boss” that I’d never be able to overcome because the anxious attachment was just too strong. I should’ve stayed cutting her off for good in my early 20s but she apologized for our childhood and I held onto that apology for dear life even when it was tremendously clear that she not only hadn’t changed as a person but in some ways had gotten even worse (going “ULTRA MAGA” as her phone case says was pretty much the catalyst)

She was helping my grandma these past few years with her cancer treatment. Long story short it finally stopped responding to treatment and she transitioned to hospice. During my grandmas final weeks my mom went snooping through her phone and financial records (my mom is already very wealthy through running a successful business complete with IRS dodging tricks, underpaying employees, etc etc, ya know, all the true American™️ business tactics) but it enraged my mom to discover that over the years my grandma had given my “disabled” uncle probably $300k and was also giving him half of her assets because the dude is a total loser who basically emotional manipulated the hell out of our dying grandma to con they money out of her. We read through his texts to her over the years and it was totally disgusting to see the explicitly-laden verbally and emotionally abusive way he would talk (scream) at her and threaten to cut contact whenever his bum ass needed money because he was always blowing his money and ending flat broke despite her already subsidizing practically everything for him.

Side note but my uncle is absolutely capable of working a desk or remote job despite his back issues but it was clearly easier to manipulate our lonely grandma who didn’t live near any of us (her choice, which we learned from her telling us in hospice he threatened her not to move closer to us or she’d lose his relationship with her) 

I say all of that backstory to say that obviously my mom like the rest of us had a reason to be mad, but in hindsight we should’ve known it was just about the money and feeling like my grandma took advantage of her (this is the same woman who loves to belt out in arguments that she’s “better than you” bc she has $5M and actually thinks it’s a legit argument…)It was also clear that my uncle had manipulated my grandma into viewing all of us in a negative light and she did have an “epiphany” about all of it before her mind started to go. There’s so much more I could say including the insane drama torture our uncle put us through with the cops, legal threats etc when he found out my grandma was staying with my mom/us for hospice but I digress

My mom confronted my poor grandma about the money and my grandma basically wouldn’t confess to anything and was kind of cold towards my mom, however my grandma is also fully aware like the rest of us how motivated by money our mom is so she was likely just trying to avoid a huge blowout. As the days got closer to her passing my mom started to discover more and more money being paid out, and instead of focusing on working with Adult Protective Services and the police to see if we could make a case for elderly abuse against our uncle, my mom took it personally and took it out ON OUR GRANDMA and the rest of us by just totally withdrawing emotionally and only doing what she needed to do with meds etc and otherwise nothing at all, and we later found out she would sit with our grandma when we weren’t there to tell her all the things she hated about her in her final days. Who by the way by this point was completely not lucid/mostly mute and clearly in lots of pain all the time.

Of course, as it always happens with my absolute witch of a mother, it all boiled over the day of her passing. My mom had multiple meltdowns and got her little minion (my stepdad) to come into the room while my sister and I were holding my grandmas hand and trying to tell her it was okay to leave, and he screamed at us to leave now because “your mom needs a break”, then said all of our shit was going to be on the porch at 5pm for us to pick up. I argued back that I wasn’t going anywhere for my poor grandma and he lost his shit (this is all on camera btw i have the footage with my poor grandma right there as he’s screaming at all of us) and screamed “BTW YOUR GRANDMA THOUGHT YOU WERE A SPOILED BRAT, AND YOUR SISTER WAS A B****. AND YOUR GRANDMA WAS A F-ing B**** TOO”. I had enough.

I confronted my mom, who like every brain dead MAGA person proceeded to take her phone out to film us since she was too stupid to realize the prior interaction was recorded on the baby monitor we got for my grandma. I didn’t give a shit, I told her she better hope trump doesn’t tank the economy she thinks he’s going to save because she’s going to need every dime she has when none of her kids are there to help her on her deathbed because we will never forgive her for this.

My sister then proceeded to grab my grandmas phones (the only text evidence of the elder abuse my mom has so I guess that’s why she took it as a way to get my mom to allow us to come back to be there for grandma) and I took the SD card from the camera so I could save the footage in case I decide to see if I can sue for some type of emotional distress or something. We were hysterically crying to our grandma and telling her we were so sorry and we’d try to find a way to come back and then we had to leave.

As we drove off my sister sent the footage to our closest family who basically had to convince my mom to do the right thing and let us back (not before she tried playing victim by sending the recording of me and trying to lie about wha happened as usual despite the footage we sent clearly disputing it all💀 they really are the dumbest fucking people I stg)

We show up, my mom lets my sister pass and then pulls up some paper and with a giant smirk on her face and says “see this? This is my power of attorney which states that I own the phones which you stole, so I’ll be pressing charges, and you’re not allowed in to see your grandma”. My sister then had to run back and say that she took them, which calmed my mom down as (without writing a whole novel like I said) she really only hates me of all of her 3 children, basically bc I’m just like her in a lot of ways but also an actually good person and the only one in the family who will talk back and give her a taste of her own medicine. I just stood there stunned. I knew in that moment that it was over. I just said to her over and over “you were going to press charges on me?? you would’ve ruined my livelihood with my career?? You would’ve ruined my life and left me destitute!” And she basically said she would’ve done it because she hates me and “well if I knew I stole a phone then I should expect to face charges” which whatever bc obviously she wasn’t going to do that to my sister

We rushed to my grandmothers side and she died 5 minutes later. That wasn’t coincidence, she needed support to pass. My brother was so close and got there right after she passed. I couldn’t even sit with my siblings and take in her passing which was SO unfair to them because I was utterly shaken to my core realizing just how evil my mother truly is. My mom walked in moments after her passing and just told me “you can leave now you can still make that flight” (she was utterly pissed at me earlier that day for telling her I was switching my flight since grandma still hadn’t passed and I couldn’t leave her side which in hindsight was a giant sign of what was to come). I told her she should leave since we all know she didn’t care. Minutes later the hospice nurse arrived and I hear her laughing in the kitchen with my mom and stepdad. I will never forget that laughter. Ever. 

We left promptly at my request because I was beginning to spiral and breakdown in a way I never did before. My whole world was collapsing. It was the longest night of my life

The next day she did her usual because too much of a p*ssy to face arguments head on (big part of why she hates me bc I show everyone else how much of a coward she really is if you just fight back) and lies through her teeth about how none of us helped our grandma in her dying days, none of us helped my mom in her house, how I deserve to lose my job bc she claimed she didn’t see me work as much on my laptop as my sister, how my sister did more to help than I did, how I dragged my siblings into “my” drama. I sent her one long final text that basically said the days of using your children to pit them against each other are over and none of your children agree with you, they agree with me over the drama YOU created. How I’ve always known she hated me, how I now realize how evil she is, and how she’s simply dead to me now. And most importantly, that I hope knowing that my grandma died minutes after us arriving would haunt her for the rest of her life.

It’s crazy how whenever these types of events happen I end up having this insane internal meltdown which basically sends my whole body into overdrive and the stress just builds and builds until…suddenly I snap and I break free. I woke up the next morning and it was like a total sense of clarity overcame me. I even went to get my shit off their porch with my sister and in the past these obvious displays of rejection, outcasting, withholding of love etc would’ve destroyed me, yet here I was no longer emotionally attached, and I just chuckled. Over how utterly pathetic these two toddlers are, still doing this bullshit well into their 60s. I chuckled for my grandma, to show her wherever she is that I’m going to be okay and I’m going to live a life she’d want me to live.

Days later we went to my grandmas viewing because my mom refused to give her a proper funeral. Before arriving we saw her obituary- my mother gave a photo of my grandma looking mad because it was her old drivers license photo, and completely belittled my grandmas life by simply saying “she liked reading, cooking, and being alone”. We had to get the funeral home to correct it all, but not before it unfortunately had already gotten published to the papers. We show up to the viewing and my mom’s sitting at the front with my stepdad standing behind her like a pathetic douchy looking body guard. We say nothing to them. They last 15 minutes before running away like the cowards they are. We collected all the photos except the ones with my mom in them, Hope that hurt that bitch tbh. We then buried my grandma, hoping to god she was able to find peace in her final moments

That’s all I have the energy to write today. It’s been a week and…I guess I feel “better”, though tbh my hatred for my mom has totally sunk in and cemented. You know what I hate most about narcissists? It’s how once you finally wake up and break free, you find that that they make you ironically hate them just as much as they hate you. I don’t like hating anyone, hell I’ve been done wrong a lot in life but I never have truly hated anyone (or been able to maintain hating them for long).

1nzkkxg,Did anyone else dream of having another family,"I have though of this since I was young. I always wanted a family that was more empathetic and compassionate. Family that like to do the things I like to do. Usually my family goes to sports games and leaves me out. They also don’t even bother to ask me what id like to do for my birthday. They yell at me for every single mistake I make even if it’s small. I accidentally dropped something, I washed my dish in the wrong sink, and I asked to have some of their toothpaste as I forgot to go to the store to get some. I feel like they want me to be perfect. My parents get mad at me whenever I call them whenever I have an emergency and need help. I was having a bad day and really struggling from the death of my family. We were at a baseball game of my brother. I sat below a tree I loved to clear my head. My dad flips out because I left the ball park and my brother got an award at the game. He always blamed me for ruining that moment for my brother. I was struggling from the death of someone whom I felt like was my best friend and he just didn’t care. I also saved up money to visit my grandpa before he passed away and after promising to help me go see him my parents went back on their promise. As a result I didn’t get to say goodbye to the other person who felt like my best friend. When I was a kid I had a neighbor whom was my best friend. She had an amazing family. I would always peer into the windows of the house and imagine what it would be like to have a family like hers. They enjoyed quality time together something I can’t do with my family.

1nzkijh,Were you given the silent treatment growing up?,"
From the time I was a kid, if I accidentally did something wrong, my parents would give me the silent treatment for several days not speaking a word to me and only give me icy looks, if that. 

I would get picked up at school and not a word on the drive home. Not a word in the house the rest of the night. Find a way to sneak dinner into my room. Go to bed, get up and face the same thing the next day. It would be such a relief when eventually they would acknowledge me because this awful silence in the house would finally disappear.

Even in college when I changed my major to something I liked (my parents had given me strict orders to go into a career I hated) my NDad didn’t speak to me for 3 weeks and we lived in the same house.

And now, in my late 40s, he and my mom still do this from time to time if I do something that isn’t of their approval. So I’m curious, is this emotional abuse and something narcissists do?

1nzjz4s,I succumbed to reactive abuse tonight and screamed like I was literally being murdered. Something just took over my body and I cracked and just screamed this deep blood curdling scream.,"Update:

I just wanted to preface this post with Wow! What a beautiful and supportive community this is! I really needed the support and I appreciate all of you internet strangers who took time out of your life to respond to me. You’ve have made a big difference and have given me a bit of oomph to get through this, move back out, get therapy and get back to healing. I hope this post helps someone else as much as it helped me! Thanks guys!!


Tonight was one of the most upsetting nights I’ve had in a long time. I had agreed to stay at my parents house for 2 months to look after their dog whilst they were away bur was blindsided when I got here to find my sister has moved back in. I only agreed to stay because I thought it was just going to be my partner and I. (My sister is a very toxic person and my parents are suspected narcissists) Instead, it’s been constant noise, intrusion, and zero awareness of boundaries.

I was already heartbroken because my partner and I had a huge fight earlier, which resulted in him leaving and booking a hotel. It was awful and he wasn’t in the wrong we have just both been under a lot of stress recently and it all came to the surface. I just wanted to quietly cook dinner and go to bed. She was cooking first, so I waited an hour. When it was finally my turn, I asked her politely if I could have some quiet while I cooked because I was upset. She didn’t stop talking. She sort of knew that my partner left but I didn’t want to bring it up with her and make it awkward for her. Then she left dirty dishes piled in the sink, it genuinely wasn’t a big deal I just mentioned I was going to move them aside so I could clean the pan and then go to bed. I really didn’t have the energy to clean her dishes for her. She suddenly got up and sort of pushed me out of the way and started arguing with me, saying I was being rude and dramatic and should have cleaned the dishes for her. I started to get upset and said please can you give me a break I’m just trying to be quick so I can go to bed I’m not feeling well. She just kept going saying things like I’m selfish for not cleaning it for her and then she said “this is why your partner left you, you’re so pedantic and annoying”. I snapped and called her and called her an evil bitch and how could she have no empathy. 

After this, she kept badgering me, making it about herself, until I finally cracked. I screamed not at her (I was facing away), just from complete emotional overload. It was very loud and animalistic. The kind of scream the neighbours call the cops over because they think someone is being murdered. I went to my room sobbing and having a panic attack. 

And instead of respecting that I needed space, she called my partner and told him I was “having a breakdown.” He came straight away thinking it was an emergency. She made this bug deal about it saying she thought I was going to hurt myself. I literally just screamed because I couldn’t escape her and had nothing left in my tank due to the earlier fight wirh my partner. 

She’s done things like this my whole life; pushing, invalidating, turning my boundaries into “rudeness,” then playing the concerned victim after she’s caused the damage. She even said once that if she killed herself it would be my fault because I wanted quiet and asked her to stop cornering me in the kitchen to tell me her office gossip when I was recovering from surgery and in a lot if pain.

I’m shaking as I write this. I feel violated, embarrassed, and furious. And now she’ll probably tell the rest of the family that I “lost it” for no reason.

I’m seriously considering going no contact. I can’t keep being around people who see my need for peace and quiet as a personal attack.


UPDATE:
Thanks everyone for your helpful messages. 

Not sure if this adds value but here is a text exchange that happened afterwards. What I find particularly hard is every time this goes down she turns around afterwards and says shit like “it’s not a big deal” “give me space”. Like she didn’t just completely ignore my request for space and for it to be left alone. She called me draining when I didn’t even want to have the interaction with her. Makes me feel like I’m going mad.

OP: Don’t ever interfere in my relationship again by calling SO. That is completely inappropriate.

I’m not having a mental breakdown I’m upset because he left. When I moved your dishes, it was simply because I was tired and wanted to quickly wash the pan before eating so I could go to bed.

I waited an hour for you to cook, which was fine, but when I finally had a chance to clean up, you could have waited 15 minutes for me to finish and then done your dishes. I was only moving them temporarily and was going to put them back. I didn’t want to clean extra dishes tonightX I also asked for quiet while I was cooking because I was upset, which is a very reasonable request.

Instead, you kept pushing when I clearly needed space, and then made a cruel comment implying SO left me because I wanted quiet and didn’t want to clean your extra dishes immediately. That was completely out of line.

I didn’t do anything to deserve that. I just needed empathy and a moment of peace. My reaction happened because I had nothing left in me, and you kept pushing.

Please leave me alone for the rest if the night. 

Sister: OP, I don’t agree with you and your version of events and how you see it but to be honest I don’t care enough, it’s trivial. This is the only message I am going to send you. The only reason I messaged SO was because regardless of what just transpired between you and I, you genuinely scared the shit out of me. You had a breakdown in front of me, screaming at the top of your lungs, holding your head and I called Marty because I was worried. Your behaviour scared me and I wouldn’t forgive myself if you did something to yourself so I asked him to come to see if he could help and support uou. That’s it. 

I am coming home now, I will give you your space but I also need you to give me my space too. 

OP: Are you actually surprised I reacted that way after you started a fight while I was already in such a vulnerable and upset state? I hope no one ever does that to you when you’re dealing with what I was.

It shouldn’t be that hard to give someone space when they ask for it. You kept badgering me until I completely cracked. The issue wasn’t me having a breakdown, it was you ignoring what I needed and pushing when I was already overwhelmed. You ignored about 6 attempts from me to ask for space. In fact you called it me being rude to you. 

Why did it bother you so much that I moved ur dirty fishes for 15 minutes. I wss going to put them back. The irony is what you accused of me you were actually doing. 

Sister: I don’t agree, I don’t see it how you see it and I am not going to argue with you about it. I am going to keep my distance now and give your space. I think it’s best we don’t talk if we don’t have too. 

Just look after yourself and get some rest 

I have a big day tomorrow so I need to come home and rest. I don’t want to talk about this anymore with you.

Just forget about it and rest 

OP: When someone asks for space and you view that as “you being treated bad” that is backwards and not right.

I was also trying not to involve u to make it not awkward for u and drag u into something I was going through with SO. I was trying to cook my steak and get the hell out of there. For you to go call him was completely wrong. 

Honestly you insinuating that I caused SO to leave me because of “the way I am”. On the same day he left me is something I will never forget you did tbh. Super fucked up thing to say to someone you supposedly love. 

Sister: you only see yourself, you don’t see others. I don’t want to discuss back and forth anymore. I don’t agree and I don’t see it like you do. also, my point was valid, what I said. I just said it to you in a vulnerable moment. You get fixed on things and sometimes you just need to let go, that’s all I meant. It can be draining for others. just rest and take care of yourself and forget about it. 

I am not replying after this. I need to switch off and take care of myself and my own mental health 

OP: You had the option for that when I asked multiple times to be left alone. Yet you kept going.

1nzijb0,There is light at the end of the tunnel,"Just found this group.  I’m 63 and cut my toxic narcissist father out of my life 8 years before he died in 2010.  We did speak prior to his passing - he knew he was gonna die and he apologized for how he treated me my whole life.   I accepted his apology half heartedly and when he died, I cried because i knew  there was never a possibility that I would have the kind of relationship with him that I always dreamed of… but I was relieved.  My tormenter was gone.  

I thought Mom would somehow find herself and enjoy life again after he berated and abused her for 50 years.   

Boy, was I wrong.   

She came to visit us (1500 miles away) and then Covid hit and we were stuck together for a year.   

Worst. Year. Ever.  

The “I’m a great mom” act disappeared in month 2.  She put me thru hell… always complaining about everything.  Teasing and ridiculing me.  My husband of 20 years (never met Dad) was in tears several times because he couldn’t believe this is what I grew up with. 

As soon as she got her 2nd covid shot and was able to fly, she was on a plane back to the Midwest and I went back into therapy which really opened my eyes.  

I feel I know both of them better than I ever did and have let everything go.  No more resentment.   No more feeling sorry for myself that I had a horrible childhood.  No more hate.  

Mom died last winter and it’s finally over.

1nzgvu8,"I cut my parents off from my life...will that adversely affect my kids, and if so, how?","(not sure if this is even the right sub for this)

In short, my parents (chiefly my father) did NOT handle a bunch of things between us well, threatened to sue me (which in my books is an unforgivable sin when done to a family member), and just in general our relationship has been a toxic one for the past 17 years or so, ever since I hit puberty.

Ever since I cut them off (cut my mom off too because she doesn't respect me either) I've been the happiest I've ever been. My life has been just filled with sunshine and rainbows. SUPER HAPPY.

But I'm concerned about my kids: I don't want this to negatively affect their self-images of themselves, like when they ask ""why didn't they come to my birthday party?""; I don't want them to think it has anything to do with THEM and that my parents don't like THEM.

My parent has always been difficult to deal with; very toxic, victimises themself in every possible situation, blames me for everything, awful compulsive liar (proven, not just my opinion btw). We recently had a bit of a disagreement (nothing physical, but big big big disagreement) over something so mundane I don't even want to give it the time of day, but they essentially overstepped my boundaries, upset me and made me extremely anxious, and then laughed about it all day.

They have since gone radio silent, blaming ill health, being busy, etc (all things I'm familiar with, they've done that my whole life), and this space has made me realise how much I actually enjoy low/no contact with them (after the initial anxiety, sadness that comes with your only parent deciding to cut you out ). I'm just so lost with what to do now.

Do I just let the silence hang, or do I clarify that I want to keep it like this and risk them losing it with me? And what do I do with the big missing piece in my life now? How do you fill the time that your N Parent used to take up without feeling guilty?

1nzfw12,Is my dad really a Narc if he let me move out?,"Ive recently starting thinking my dad has narcissistic tendencies. He’s very egotistical and selfish, and the only time he ever really took an interest in me was if it involved shopping or going to fancy restaurants. He’d encourage me to buy things he liked over my choices even if it was more expensive and usually focused on top brands and although he always insisted on paying, he’d later hold it over me. Or sometimes the opposite make promises of buying me something and never actually do it. Mutliple cases he said he would get me or my sister something then bought it for himself and showed it off.

After my parents divorced as the eldest child, I ended up taking on more of a parent role when we stayed with him cooking, cleaning, and helping with my younger siblings. His house is dirty and he can't cook to save his life but is very critical of food.

He discouraged me from moving out for a long time, mainly because of how expensive London is. At the time, it made sense to stay since I was just starting out working. Then i got married and stayed between houses and when i had my own child. His behaviour became harder to cope with, his rage that I used to brush off became scarier and i found it strange how much he put himself first and got annoyed at the baby taking priority. At this time I started stonewalling and stayed at my in-laws until we moved into our own place.

I’ve read that narcissistic parents usually never let their kids leave, but I wonder if that’s always true. My dad hates children, so I sometimes think that’s why he was happy for me to go. He never tried to force me to stay, and honestly, I’m relieved I moved far away. Because he also does the whole you need to look after me act and is unwell every week.My sister moved into my old room after I left, but she only lasted a couple of months before moving out too. Does it sound like he is a narcisst even though he didn't try control me into staying? He doesn't make much contact now other than dramatically to tell me he's so ill, moan about my sister or make plans to go somewhere for father's day or his birthday. He hasn't made any effort to visit me.

1nzf74s,Munchausen by proxy,"When I was in a therapy session a few months back and I was telling her about certain things my mother did and she asked me if my mother had munchausen by proxy.

This was because she would keep me off school and also when I was little I was meant to go with friends to a live show but my mum said I couldn't and then she told me to tell them all that I was ill and I wasn't and she kept insisting I lied when they came over and say I'd been ill.

Anyway, I said no, but there was something playing in the back of my head. I was talking about it with people yesterday and they said they thought it might be, so I'm asking here for anyone who might have experience.

So, when I was a baby I was ill and my eardrum burst, apparently it left scaring or something, I don't know, but my mum said because of that if they looked into that ear it would be red.

So if something was coming up or I had a cold and my mum wanted me to have antibiotics, she would tell me to tell the dr that I had an earache in that particular ear (even though I didn't have any earache) so that when the dr looked and saw it was red they would think I had an infection and give the antibiotics. 

I don't know if that's the same thing as munchausens or really what it really was at all TBH (same as a lot of things that happened). Also think maybe it's worth mentioning to my therapist probably.

1nzekr7,"Grandmother on deathbed, my mother thinks my asscrack psoriasis is important","I've had psoriasis for 16 years now, starting at age 21 when I was still living with my parents. While the scalp itching can be exquisite, I've never really said that I ""suffer"" from psoriasis, except that my mother makes me suffer from it. I've said this for years, without really understanding the depth of this fact. Now I understand of course, hence my posting here. Nobody in my life ever brings it up, only my mother would consistently remind me of it. When I would visit my parents, she would regularly bring out a full sized vacuum cleaner within 5 minutes of me sitting down on their leather couch to literally vacuum me and the couch. Without asking, of course. At other times, she would start slapping my shoulders because of the flakes, also without asking.

That's a bit of context, now for the episode that I'd like to get off my chest. My grandmother (her mother) was the only emotionally safe member of my immediate family. Her husband has been dead for almost 20 years, which was pretty great since he was probably a full blown psychopath. Because of her advanced age and close contact with my mother, I couldn't tell her about everything, but being with her was at least safe.

In the fall of 2024 she had a heart attack and ended up in hospital. From that point on, my mother controlled everything. For more than a week my mother didn't tell me where she was and what was going on. My father knew where she was, but otherwise he was kept in the dark like I was. Only on what was supposed to be her last night, after she had a stroke I was told where I could visit her. I suspect she made sure that I could only see my grandmother when she wasn't able to hold a conversation any more. Gotta make sure she can't tell me any ""secrets"" !

When I walked into her room my mother literally jumped on me, probably to put on a show for the other family members. Me, like the crazy person that I am was only thinking about comforting my grandmother, I went completely stiff and whispered to leave me alone. Then, she started to proclaim to my grandmother ""Your grandson is here, you can let go now!"" which I found particularly gross.

At that point I was the only one who still treated my grandmother as a real person, the others were talking about the time of her death as if they were waiting on a train. At this point it was unclear whether she was consciously experiencing everything, but I made an attempt to comfort her by holding her hand and stroking her shoulder on her non-paralyzed side. I did this until I was exhausted, then took a walk. I repeated this 3 or 4 times.

The next day she died, and I spoke to my mother on the phone mostly about practical matters wrt. the funeral like dates and what to wear. The only things she said referencing my visit were: ""When you sat down on the edge of her bed, your shirt lifted and your asscrack psoriasis was visible to everyone."" She said that in her typical ""triumphantly disappointed"" tone. I have a psoriasis plaque the size and shape of a CD/DVD neatly centered on my asscrack.

That is all.

1nzekjf,My mother can control her behaviour when she wants to - wtf is going on with her?,"TW: mention of suicide.

My mother has always needed to be the center of attention. She’s constantly “ill,” always at the doctor, always getting new tests. There’s always some kind of health drama. Often a new crazy and restrictive diet to combat the illness (when really she needs to stop drinking alcohol, which she wont do). At one point, she told me she had cancer and wouldn't answer her phone for hours afterwards. She didnt have cancer.

When I was six, she tried to kill herself in front of me. She posts passive-aggressive status updates on WhatsApp — usually vague things ""if only the world were kind” or “let down.”

She gossips constantly, can’t keep a secret, and often shares other people’s private information. At the same time, she talks endlessly about how her own mother was neglectful, but never reflects on how she’s treated her own children. My eyes roll but I find it upsetting. 

If I phoned her just to chat, she would cry because she said she hadnt heard from me in so long (3 days max). 

About ten years ago, I started setting boundaries and going low contact when her behavior crossed the line. Since then, she’s mostly stopped acting out with me — but she still does it with my siblings and my uncle.

For a long time, I assumed she might have ADHD because of the impulsivity and emotional volatility. But the fact that she can control herself when she wants to makes me think it’s something else.

My father is also difficult to live with. He has to be the loudest voice in the room and constantly seeks attention. His moods fluctuate a lot, and he gets angry very easily — especially if anyone criticizes him. He often calls us “snowflakes” when we say he’s hurt us, and he’s extremely controlling. He has periods of depression which are hard to cope with. 

Although my father is who he is, he is the one I go to when I need a level headed response from a parent because my mum is so emotional. 

I’m not trying to diagnose either of them (although maybe i am for my own sanity) — I’m just trying to make sense of the patterns I grew up with. Has anyone else experienced parents like this? I cant get over how my mother seems capable of control but only apply it selectively?",Spanner4444-,1759743633.0,10,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1nzekjf/my_mother_can_control_her_behaviour_when_she/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1nzekjf/my_mother_can_control_her_behaviour_when_she/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1nzej7v,Book recommendations for estranged/disowned children?,"Hi everyone, I was wondering if anyone had any good book recommendations for children who have been estranged from/disowned by their parents, particularly mothers.

I'm 25 and haven't spoken to my mum in over three years. We had a very difficult and complicated relationship when I was growing up - she was never overtly abusive, but was very emotionally manipulative, for example when I was in my final year of uni she told me on the phone that she was going to commit suicide and it was all my fault, and then hung up and refused to answer the phone again, forcing me to call an ambulance for her from another city, and then got mad at me for wasting the ambulance's time and causing a fuss when it turned out that she was absolutely fine. 

She also chose to be in relationships with men who were abusive towards me and my younger sister, one of which kicked me out of the house and told me to never come back, and she just stood there letting it happen. I had to crash at friend's houses until my grandparents let me move in with them because I had nowhere else to go.

Despite this I still loved her and just wanted her to love me back. 

The period of no contact kind of happened by accident. We had an awful fight because someone I was close to lost their life to cancer, and after the funeral, I called her to try and get some comfort. But she screamed at me down the phone because I was crying too much and hung up on me. And then... just neither of us reached out to the other for almost three years.

I have tried to do a lot of healing and growing in that time, and I do believe I am doing better. But I reached out to her a few months ago to ask if she would like to have a conversation and try to rebuild, and she just never replied, even though I know she opened the message. Despite everything, I am devastated. I guess I always felt like I was to blame for everything that happened, and if I could just be the way she wanted me to be, then she would love me. But now it's clear that she is done with me and wants nothing to do with me. I found out recently that she moved to the other side of the country and didn't even tell me, so I have no idea where she even is now. 

So... does anyone have any books about coming to terms with the fact a parent just doesn't love or care for you at all?!

1nzdcpu,Can confronting a covert narcissist parent ever turn out well?,"My mom - and to a lesser, enabling extent my dad - is pretty solidly a covert narcissist profile. 

It took me over twenty years to figure this out: for the longest time I just accepted the narrative that all the horrific shit that happened to me as a kid or teen was either my own fault or simple happenstance. That same narrative systematically downplayed their own involvement or wrongdoing. Everything bad that's ever happened to me is framed as happenstance, my own fault, or as ""care"" or ""tough love"" or ""doing their best"" when they're directly involved.

They're also the type to offer intermittent, context dependant reinforcement: these days we get weeks of peace interspaced by periods of fighting over being fucked over again. It's become pretty clear that despite claims of unconditional support and love they'll only ever tolerate my choices and actions of they would have made those decisions myself. The times I've gone against their wishes I've dealt with anything from coercion to second (and third and fourth...) guessing, passive aggressive comments, etc.

They're all too happy to parrot my achievements and feign support and congratulations...but they seem to be oblivious to the cost those achievements exacted on me. If I did everything according to their wishes academically and professionally...well I'd either be dead, or some burnt out shell (not that I didn't get close). If nothing else, any significant achievement seems like it sets the new bar for how I'm judged in the future.

Phrases like ""you're just too sensitive"" and ""tough love"" and ""it didn't happen like that"" and ""you're inventing things/twisting my words"" are common occurances in this family. 

I've found out first hand what active confrontation on my part gets me: blame, claims of entitlement, threats to my material safety,  getting kicked out,  gaslighting...all shrouded in a cloak of concern and needing to look out for themselves. 

It's gotten exponentially worse since I've come to terms with this fact, that I've stopped looking like their ideal of a compliant, family oriented kid - that I'm not playing by the rules anymore.  I don't know if my younger sister was spared most of this, if it took a different form for her, or if she's yet to realize what's happened...but she's also struggled on some of the aspects I did.

The latest bullshit example would be about how they put down the old family dog without asking me if I wanted to be there (I live an hour away for uni and could easily have been there), hid the dog's passing for me to ""discover"" and press them about when I got back and then told me I ought to have payed attention and I was being a brat for being pissed they never called me at any point (add weaponized grief and guilt tripping). Last month they kicked me out for a while and called my life pointless. The month before that they told me to get over being assaulted in public.

Anyway...I know direct confrontation is unlikely to help matters. Soon I'll be completely free of their material influence. They've offered to go to family therapy once, but I honestly don't trust them - given my history - to not try and weaponize that against me in some way. They'll sooner burn down any semblance of relationship with me than admit any sort of fault or attack the version of themselves they have in their heads. I used to commend how they didn't replicate their childhood trauma...but now I'm just realizing they're changing how it's presenting.

Is there any way this can ever improve?

1nzc3wx,I'm really struggling 🤷🏻‍♀️,"I've been struggling for years especially since becoming a mum. I had an abusive dad physically and emotionally and I'd say my mum was emotionally abusive and still is. It isn't emotional abuse where she sits and calls me names. It's a lack of love, never showing love or telling me she loves me. Abandoning me even as an adult. She goes months not seeing or talking to me even though she lives 15 minutes away. Doesn't help me in anyway and doesn't help as a grandparent either. She shames me if I ask for help, makes it about her. If I confront her behaviour she makes it all about her and blocks me and speaks to me like she's a child telling me to go away etc she's more like a stranger to me now. I used to feel so attached to my mum in a best friend sort of way despite her behaviour but the older I got the more I recognised how wrong it all is. My dad isn't in my life at all. He was both a physical and emotional abuser who didn't show me an ounce of love in my life and simply doesn't care (he's never reached out or apologised) I had a step dad who was wonderful and the most amazing parent to me. He came into my life at 18 years old and became an amazing step dad despite the fact I was an adult and my mum mistreated him something rotten even to the point she didn't believe he had cancer, called him a liar etc (he died of cancer) 

I've had C-PTSD since I was 18 probably younger (abusive childhood, SA and two abusive relationships plus losing multiple people to death) I'm tired. 

In 2021 I had a breakdown and the abuse I received for mentally not coping is unbearable. My mum would be so horrible I'd wet myself and I'd ring her crying and she'd hang up on me and tell me I can't cry I'm a mum. She used to cry in front of me constantly as a child. 

I have been battling agoraphobia for years since my breakdown. I can't travel far. I'm working hard on it. I have ocd, anxiety, ptsd. A chronic bladder condition in pain daily and pcos which worsens my mental health.

My mum doesn't talk to me
Doesn't help me
Doesn't want to listen or talk to me
None of family do (they're all the same) 

So essentially I'm alone which means I'm heavily reliant on my husband. Which impacts both our lives if I had support from family and outside of him things would be so much better but I have no one 

Financially I am struggling to the point I'm considering food banks. At risk of homelessness due to section 21 and begged my mum for help (she has money from my dad during divorce) she just makes me feel shameful and is horrible and refuses. Yet everyone helped her. And if we didn't she'd lose it. 

I just feel helpless and alone. I'm struggling money wise through no fault of own. Husbands income is good but homelessness in last house due to section 21 left us here (and going through again) plus emergency vet bills, car bills. We never spend our money apart from essentials/bills. 

I'm at a loss I had not having anyone to turn to for help. I hate feeling so alone. I hate I have no family, no emotional support, no one to turn to, feel close to, laugh with. Ask for help. Cry to. Why don't I have that? I never have or will. I'm so upset about it and as a parent I'm struggling. I make some of my parents mistakes I have no emotional regulation yet I also parent in a way they never did but my trauma leaves me making mistakes

1nzadrq,Anyone else feel like they missed life until they got away from their n parents?,"I went NC in my mid 20s and essentially realized I had to start my life over. My parents isolated me from kids my age and controlled me through fear and manipulation. My parents either ignored or sabotaged me so I never really did anything kids usually do, or even know about things normal kids were doing.

Once I left my parents house and into my early twenties, I started to recognize that there was a lot out there that I just didn't understand or wasn't a part of. But I think normal life was just too overwhelming for me to do anything but try to survive. Also my parents continued to try to sabotage me and control me, even though I no longer lived with them. I was still financial dependent on them to some extent, so I wasn't really able to separate from them.

After I went NC, I realized there were a lot of things that I had missed, etc. For example, I wasn't allowed to listen to music as a kid and didn't know anything about pop culture. I'd never had a girlfriend or really been on a date, even. I'd never really drank alcohol and was terrified of drugs, even pot. I realized my mom had bought me really bad clothes my whole life and I didn't know how to dress with any style. I also grew up with a very weak enabler father and a mother who tried to feminize me, so I was also not well adjusted in terms of being a confident guy.

The worst part was that I felt like everyone was moving forward in their lives and I was alone left behind. I know that people struggle with different things in their lives.

Even if I’m an adult that isn’t higher needs. They just think this because I have autism and anxiety and mood issues. I have no issues working and going to school. i just don’t like food, retail, and general customer facing jobs. I have straight A’s and a 3.9 GPA and I’m in an english honor society.

Sometimes when they say this I partially worry this may be the case, even though my friends and partner tell me that it’s not true. I’m also scared that they’ll do things like use the social security they have in the safe to take out debt, hire a private investigator, stalk me, etc if I move out.

I guess I need validation or some relating to help me feel better? I just feel so scared. I know I have to ASAP as I’m nearing 30.

1nz9zih,Trapped,"My mother is my abuser, both mentally and physically. No father in my life. Despite trying to get back up numerous times and heal, I feel trapped in an endless cycle of doom.

I’m a bright student and beyond that, I’ve always poured my heart out for things I’m passionate about. Even in the environment I was raised in, I was always fighting to do better and prove myself. I did volunteer work, participated in two internships programs, and after school clubs in high school. I had really good grades in middle school and high school all until the last year and a half of high school where the world was in shutdown due to Covid. During the pandemic, I was trapped at home with my abuser and it only got worse. I was so mentally beaten down that I gave up everything related to my life, and school was the last thing on my mind. My record of good grades and test scores was wiped away with a smear of Fs. 

Part of me still held on to hope that I could get out and still make something of myself. That’s when I first moved out. The moment I freshly turned 18, I turned to a friend for help and found a way to move out and for nearly a whole year I was no contact. I healed a lot during that time, but because of years of abuse I was suffering from mental and physical health issues, and even things like my future were wiped away. I wasn’t in college, I worked a minimum wage job and just focused on trying to live life normally. That would never be enough in the real world. I was able to pay rent (really affordable rent in a shared house) because I had savings and a job that covered my necessities, but that money would dwindle down extremely fast the moment I left that house.

After that year of staying away and keeping no contact, I felt much better, I applied for college, I couldn’t get into any top tier college at that point, but I still got into a university. I did well at that university and I was still living away from my mom, but I was receiving financial support from her for college as I started to reconnect with her. For a while things were good.

While I was in university, I was pursing a career and major that required connections. So I decided to transfer to a more prestigious university known globally for those connections and networks relating to that field that I could utilize. The problem was that tuition and living expenses were ten times more than what I was currently spending. My family could afford it, but it meant having to be more financially dependent on my mom than ever. I became very hesitant with proceeding. But I took a gamble and applied to transfer in my first year of college not thinking that I had a shot of getting accepted with only a year of college to show for it, but I got did get accepted and took it as fate that I should go. That I could go on to achieve greater things despite how much I struggled in my childhood. It meant I could start over. That acceptance felt like I could rewrite my life; which all sounds insane, I know. But, that’s what it felt like, that I had a rope that I could climb to get out of the pit I was in.

I could move from my small town to a big city with much more opportunities and see the world that I never got to see. So despite the risks, I took that chance not knowing I was only bringing more stress to myself. I drained all my own personal savings there, it was expensive to begin with, but I didn’t want to owe an even greater debt to my mother no matter how small I my contribution was because I knew anything with her has strings attached. My health rapidly deteriorated when I was there and soon everything came crashing down.

My hopes and dreams vanished. I had no money left. Nothing. I was forced to move home and be on medical leave. To make it bearable, I suppressed my emotions, but things always seemed to seep out.

If it at all sounds like I overcame my trauma during this, I didn’t. I just worked around it. I still constantly had night terrors and got ill from stress from the time I first moved out and all throughout college and even after I transferred. It never stopped. 

I was in therapy for the entirety of my first year of college and it did help with the depression and anxiety that I was facing in those moments, but I did nothing in helping me overcome the real damage of my childhood.

So imagine being me, still wounded and back at square one again. No resources to get me out. In close proximity with my abuser who hasn’t taken any responsibility for their actions, denies any wrongdoing, and expects me to play a part in their happy and healthy family dynamic. I’m not allowed to even be sad. Anything I do or say to defend myself or if I’m acting out because I’ve been triggered, she immediately victimizes herself saying that I want to kill her and want her dead. How suffocating is it that I can’t even exist and express the damage that she caused me. I have depression and anxiety, and whether she likes it our not my body is conditioned to fear her. Fight, flight, and freeze all of it has been triggered before. Just seeing her unexpectedly is enough for me to jump and scream unwilling from fear. She expects and demands respect like other parents, but she was never like the other parents. Her defense is that she does things that any other parent has done, her extent of wrongdoing that she’ll admit to is just the hitting. Other kids get spanked and hit, it’s not that uncommon, but if it were just that, I wouldn’t be so scarred. There is no justification for what she’s actually done and to say that she is like other parents is just her own imagination. Her constant denial, will always make me the crazy one. In her eyes, the way I act is because I’m “too sensitive”.

Even though for the last three years I’ve been working desperately get better and try to make a better life for myself and hope to fulfill my potential, I’m reduced back to nothing. If I act out in any way, she withdraws any financial support that I need to pick myself back up (medical expenses, basic necessities, etc.). Everything is in her hands.

How am I supposed to live? I can’t stop thinking I was never meant to be born in the first place. My other family members are finally starting to see her for who she is and the damage she caused me. From having untreated medical conditions from when I was younger starting reappear even worse, to new conditions that I have to face most likely due to being starved and not having proper nourishment when I was younger. And my mental state rapidly deteriorating from all the stress of suppressing my feelings. I can only see death as the option for me. Only in death will it become obvious that everything they called me crazy and broken for was caused by her. Yet, somehow that brings me so much peace. Even if I die, as long as it comes to light that I’m not at fault for being broken, I will be at peace.

No one has ever been on my side and I was never able to build strong relationships with others due to lack of trust and forced isolation by her throughout the entirety of my life. And now that I’m an adult, there are no consequences for her, she still gets a normal life while I suffer actually alone. What do I do? I feel like someone who doesn’t want to die but needs to die.

1nz9bym,Parents who guilt me to visit them and don’t take no for an answer,"Prefacing this with the following: I’ve been in therapy for a long time, have become way more comfortable with asserting boundaries and not letting them guilt me. I’ve been low contact with them. Mostly need to rant and feel validation for my frustration.

Backstory: my parents sold their house and moved across the country. They seem to think I can just get up and go visit them whenever they want and I’ve been extremely clear this isn’t realistic or possible. When I tell them no they challenge that and use it as an opportunity to try to persuade me. I’m going to stop explaining my
reasoning to them because they think they can offer up solutions, but in reality that isn’t going to change my mind. They’re not self-aware or rational enough to reflect on how these behaviors actually create the opposite effect (push me away and strain our relationship further when they crave closeness).

I’m just tired of parents who see me as an extension of themselves and don’t respect my needs/space/energy. I’m tired of feeling like I’m explaining basic social etiquette to children instead of full grown adults. I limit my communication and have gotten really firm with them and I’m proud of myself for that. They still manage to ruin my mood and are emotional vampires. I feel drained and frustrated whenever I interact with them and this is a huge reason I limit visits (aside from the obvious travel expenses and time).

I have plenty of healthy and loving and supportive relationships with a partner and many friends and am grateful for that. I wish my parents were more understanding of other peoples’ needs and not expect people to drop everything for them. Not really looking for advice here; rather support.

1nz8oxs,"I am tired and sick of living at home , especially because of  my mother.","
I don’t really know where else to put this, but I need to get it off my chest.

I’m a 25 year old woman from a South Asian background, currently doing an MSc in Physiotherapy. I have ADHD and find the course incredibly challenging. I even quit one of my placements because of burnout and almost dropped out, but my lecturer convinced me to give it one more try. I’m starting a new placement soon and still have my dissertation due, so I’m already mentally stretched thin.

On top of that, my younger brother, who will be 21 soon, has been struggling with long-term cannabis use. It has really affected his mental health, he’s paranoid, forgetful, anxious, and often crying. I was the one who realised something was seriously wrong and told our parents. My mum denied it at first and blamed his eating habits, but I pushed for help. I made the doctor’s appointments, filled in forms, called services, went with him, and did everything I could while trying to keep myself afloat.

My mum has been demanding and guilt-tripping me constantly. Tonight she called while I was out and told me to come home immediately because I should be “spending time with my brother.” She said I had “left home long ago.” I snapped and yelled at her because I just couldn’t take it anymore.

I grew up in a strict, joyless household. No family outings, no holidays, no warmth. Every time I tried to do something for myself, my mum would call, shout, and ruin it. It feels like she wants to control every moment of my life, and now she expects me to parent my brother too. She never acknowledges anything I do, only criticises or demands more.

Coming from a South Asian family makes it even harder. The cultural expectations, guilt, control, and the belief that as the daughter I owe everyone my time and obedience are overwhelming. Even though I’m 25, I’m still treated like a child. I can’t openly have a boyfriend, I have to hide the fact that I’m in a relationship. It’s frustrating because we can’t even be a normal couple and spend time together freely. I also can’t dress the way I want as well. It’s like I’m never allowed to simply be an adult or make choices for myself.

I feel guilty, angry, and exhausted. I honestly just want to move out and never come back, but I’m broke and trying to finish this degree. I feel like I’m stuck and hopeless.

I don’t even know what advice I’m looking for, I just needed to say it somewhere.

He’s always been one of those guys who has to be the boss and tells everyone what to do. 

The other night At 1:30 am my dog wanted out of my room and instead of letter her go by herself and bark at the end of their bed to be picked up i brought her up myself so that she wouldn’t bark and Ig i was loud bc he woke up and stated swearing at me to “get the fuck to bed” and stuff like that but my mom didn’t wake up and she wakes up super easily so I think he was already awake. 

Then again at 10:30 pm me and my friends where on fortnite and i was getting a bit loud and my mom texted me to quite down which is fine and i would have but before i could even respond to her he comes barging in saying “Ik your a nocturnal animal and never come out of your room but you need to stop being such a puke and shut up” (Which doesn’t even make sense since I work 5 days a week and the only time i’m on ps5 is when my friends are too). So i said “mom just told me too why do you need to come down and yell at me” Then he just went on about how he’s gonna take my things away like monitor and ps5 that I personally own and he had no part in paying for. He then goes on to tell me everything in this house is his. so since i’m 18 he’s not allowed to do that so I told him to go ahead and he must have known he couldn’t since he Took the power cord instead which i’m not entirely sure he’s even allowed to take that since its apart of the console.

1nz6k4x,Have your parents also been shitty for religious reasons?,"My parents aren't bad people (or so I think), always invalidating my traumas, ha ha ha. I am an 18-year-old woman, atheist and lesbian, a huge minority and likely subject to manipulation and abuse with parents who have that kind of attitude. They force me to go to a church I hate, there are dangerous people there, the pastor pressures me to be baptized, and I recently found out that he speaks badly of me. Well, that's not the point, sorry lol. 

Yesterday I told them I didn't want to go to their church, and they threatened again to stop paying for my studies and kick me out of the house, saying that I was indirectly responsible for the problems at home, that my dad wouldn't get a loan, etc. I recently got my ears pierced (their religion frowns upon jewelry), and my dad yelled at me and called me worldly. My mom did the same. I cried so much, and since then I've had this little voice in my head telling me that I'm sinning, at the very least. I am so afraid of them.

They have given me everything: an education, food, a roof over my head. They have been loving towards me, but now I see them differently, especially my father. I can't even defend my mom from his insults because he takes it out on me too, until I cry. But he doesn't want to be seen as the bad guy. He is the poor victim. He says he is a Christian, but he is a piece of shit. 

I will also never forget how my mother told me she would rather I get pregnant at a young age than see me with another woman because that is an abomination to God and she would take her own life if I continued with “my things.” Obviously, I have to pretend that I like men so as not to end her life HAHAHA. Haven't you heard about that commandment? Honor your father and mother so that your days may be long, otherwise I'll be cursed, typical bullshit argument from parents like that. Let me clarify that I HATE the God of the Bible WITH ALL MY BEING. Many people will probably tell me to report it, to run away, to go to someone else, BUT IT'S NOT EASY. Besides, I'm so manipulated that I also feel like I'm sinning by being a bad daughter and not meeting their expectations. I don't want to end up in a cult like them or be a miserable woman married to a man who will probably mistreat me like my dad does my mom. Please help.

1nz5fsj,Should I cancel my wedding to avoid emotional abuse from my parents,"I’m in my mid-30s and planning my wedding in Europe next May. I never expected my father to attend after everything that happened earlier this year when my sibling got married. We all traveled abroad for the wedding, and during that time, my father fell seriously ill. We found out he’d been neglecting medical advice and treatments back home, and it was a nightmare trying to get him the help he needed.
While he was in the hospital for a month recovering, I was by his side the entire time, but it was emotionally draining. My dad was verbally abusive to me the whole time, making cruel comments about how my family and I were off “having fun” while he was in the hospital, even though we were literally there 24/7. My mother wasn’t much help either, barely present at the hospital, and when I broke down from the stress, she told me I was “overreacting” and that “it’s just your dad.” It was incredibly isolating and traumatic, and I ended up spending nights sleeping in a hospital chair out of fear that my dad might leave.
Now, months later, I have a wedding coming up, and my father has expressed that he wants to attend, despite his health issues. I offered to host a second smaller wedding closer to Asia to make it easier for him to attend, but he insists on coming to Europe. To be honest, just the thought of him being there is so traumatic that I’m considering canceling the whole wedding. I don’t want to spend my special day dealing with the stress and emotional abuse again.
My mum, however, is looking forward to my dad being there and is very reliant on him. She doesn’t understand the emotional toll his behavior has had on me and thinks I’m “overreacting.”
I’m conflicted—on one hand, I don’t want to cancel my wedding and lose the chance to have a celebration that’s about me and my future with my partner. But on the other, I feel like I’d be walking into a situation where I’m setting myself up for more emotional abuse, and I’m not sure if I can handle it.

1nz4okj,Another narcissistic person,"I used to have a narcissistic friend and she literally tried to ruin my life when I cut her out.

She always made jokes at my expense. She tries to compete with me, like when she knows I like or want something, she will definitely get it for herself. The works. So I know how destructive having a narcissist in my life.

So I cut her off and, guess what? A new narcissist was introduced to my life. Let us call her Patty.

When I cut the narcissist out of my life, I was also entering a new era of my life. I quit my job and moved to Germany. I spent a year learning German, and that is where I met Patty through mutual friends.

She was very kind and charming at first, as was my ex-friend. The first red flag was when she urged me to treat everyone to pizza, which I did.

I have always been a generous person, and I saw them as beloved friends at the time.

As we were in the restaurant, they took a group photo without me. Actually, I was there but you can see me ordering at the counter when they took the photo. None of them took a new one. After that, I thought we were all going home and that they simply were about to go the same direction. But the truth was they had planned on hanging out without me.

Second red flag was when she tried to get my sympathy to give her a regular allowance for her family. She was asking me for help to pay for her exam. She said told me the sob story about her aunt telling her hurtful things so she doesn't want to ask money from her anymore. So I gave her momey. THEN she told me about how she needs more because her mother is useless and they have no money for food. ON THE SAME BREATH, she sends me a photo of her holding the keys to the house and lot her aunt gave her for finishing college. That was such a thing that my ex-friend would do.

So after that, I became more wary of her but SHE WOULD NOT LET GO. 

She kept wanting to meet with me, and when we did, she always has ""no money"" and hungry. But I had a gut feeling she would do that, so I also always leave most of my money behind. The thing is, one time, we were at this Cinnamon store and I only had money for the cheapest ones. So I made her choose the one I can afford to buy her, only for her to secretly tell the sales clerk that she wants the more expensive one. THEN WHAT DOES SHE DO?? ""Ugh, this is too sweet. It's not good."" Like??? I literally offered to just buy boba tea when she said she wants that but we went to the cinnamon store because I was craving for cinnamon roles.

After that, I just kept dodging her and I plan on cutting off everyone that is connected to her. She is toxic.

1nz4drt,I think I ruined my life,"I don't know where to start but basically I'm overwhelmed and no one can help me. Im sorry in advance, English isn't my first language.

1 years ago, I crashed out on my mom, and my dad for the bullshit they put through my whole life, i told them that i wanted to go away out of the house because of the abuse they put ne through( one time, my dad litterally tried pushed me off the stair because he thought i wasn't listening to him when i was trying to find a shirt to eat. It was five years ago). 

I'm a 20 year old female, living in Belgium probably dealing with an undiagnosed adhd and other trauma. I have anger issue and sometimes i can't control my emotions.

Let's start, it's been 2 years since my dad apologised, i didn't forgave him, at all because i thought he didn't deserve it( he literally let out a laugh and said:"" Well didn't i tell that if you had a problem you could have said it) and 5 days later he said something like, as his apology ("" i love you so much, you know our parent used to beat us too""/""I congrulate you, now when   )

I didn't hear ""sorry i beat you ass, i should have known better"". He only sorry because I call out on his bullshit... he doesn't want to take pay for his responsibility.

Now come the worst: My mother.

I'm pretty sure she is narcissist.

She thought that i was egotistical for not forgiving him and that one I'll do it (absolutely not and never will).

Next, she married that man the VERY SAME YEAR, and was upset that i didn't come to their wedding. Ok.

Fast forward march-June 2025, while i was bedroting and eating in the kitchen, iwas doing fine, she came out, i just put my leftover on the fridge, she became all fake ask what was going with me but i was going to my room. Literally Nothing, for once i wasn't insane.
She keep pushing for me to confess, but no, i wasn't going to because there were nothing. Im felling overwhelmed and i was beginning to raise my voice. I scream ""I'M NOT TELLING YOU ANYTHING, ESPECIALLY NOT TO YOU""!

Fast forward to that, she talking about ""her problems"" to her sister, she was just criticisim me for not finding a home to live, that all i do is resting on my bed"" i concronted her and all she was doing is victiming herself.

Im going to hard tine, I'm trying to survive with a shitty government who made service for people in help harder, i tried to find a lot of locations to live but i still couldn't decide to wich one is a better option. 

Fast forward to today, i was angry, i tried to calm down but i couldn't, my mom wake up because she was sleeping on the couch.

She started to make a big deal by the fact that i just destroyed one plate when i was trying  to clam down, she started to berate me, i threw a box of chocolate powder i her because she was started to get on my nerves, i lash out and said that she was a bad mom, litteraly that she is a kid beater too, that she criticised me a lit but now she doesn't to hear anything, she said that she has to go to school tomorrow that i should leave the house, and i wasn't her problem anymore.

She also said that if, i didn't find a home to live i could commit suicide. I'm not her problem anymore.

Daaaamn.

I leave this here, there are other things to say, I'll come back later.

1nz41kd,It's crazy to think about growing up in a space where you can NEVER ask a question.,"I did inner child therapy work tonight, and it was filled with very young flashbacks to around 5-9 years old. The flashbacks all centered around questions.

""I'm not good at hitting a baseball, can you help me get better?""

""I'm scared of going to middle school, what if I don't make friends?""

""How do birds fly?""

These are just a few of the many things I wanted to know as a kid, but had to bury deep down inside for fear of either being ignore, gaslit or give them ammunition and data to use against me later. 

It's *insane* to think about a child having to figure out so much on their own. I'm happy that I eventually learned the things I needed, but am a little embarrassed it took so long. There's been dozens of times I've asked for help or asked someone a question and then got a puzzling look not believing I did not know the information.

I'm hoping to grieve this out and keep letting my inner child and let it ask the questions it wants to get out and heal him the best I can :)",PattyIceNY,1759708473.0,40,0.95,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1nz41kd/its_crazy_to_think_about_growing_up_in_a_space/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1nz41kd/its_crazy_to_think_about_growing_up_in_a_space/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1nz3sew,"I don’t want to go therapy, do inner child work, or heal anymore.","
I want my childhood back. I want to re do my childhood and have a childhood I don’t have to heal from. I want an adulthood where don’t have to do inner child work, reparent myself and piss away money for therapy to heal from things I didn’t want or choose experience.



I want a childhood with filled with happy memories. I wanna childhood with a loving family where I feel safe, happy, loved and protected. I want a father that didn’t scream at me, call me names and throw objects at me. I want a mother who protected me. I want a sister who wasn’t able to get away with abusing me to because she was the favourite of both off them. I want a safe family home where grown adults weren’t screaming, swearing, calling each other names, throwing objects and slamming doors in each other’s faces everyday. 



No amount of therapy or healing will give me a what I want. No amount of healing will give me loving family, happy childhood or a safe home. No amount of therapy will give me back all the years I should’ve been happy but were miserable over those things I didn’t choose to experience. No amount of any of that will add an extra 20 years to my life to make up for the previous 20 pissed down the drain. 



I don’t want that love and protection from myself. I want that love, protection and safety from someone else I want that love and protection from someone older and wiser than me. Why do I have to put in so much time, energy and effort in finding love, safety  protection when others have never had to work for it a day in their lives.

1nz3fej,Is my family narc?,"I genuinely cant tell, as I know its a broad spectrum and the term is thrown around a lot. My parents are heavy on transphobia and religiousity. Please help
But basically - any time my mom is slightly frustrated, she really just kind of gets way too angry and yells. The other day, I was in the car, and last second I had made a decision I wanted to go to a little school-approved party with my classmates. She proceeded to yell and scream about how, ""you dont care about me!! nobody cares about me!! my life is so shitty!! i hate my life"" just because of a change in plans, which I explicitly said she could say no to. She loves throwing around this at her grown age, that ""nobody cares about her"" and ""you dont care about me"" ""everyone treats me soo bad"" and ""if i got sick you probably wouldnt care"" because of slight inconveniences or mistakes. She has done this for YEARS at any brief slight issue. 
 
Just today, I won't give full context to keep it brief, but basically my mom called my sister a ""dummy"". I said, ""huh thats not very nice to call her that"". It proceeded to be a lecture about how, she was just joking. And rather than calmly saying I misunderstood, it delved into the idea I never thank her for anything!! I never give her anything!! I treat my mom like trash just because I dont meet these expectations. I've thanked her before and bought her stuff.

Then she proceeded to say how bad it is that i joked about the terrible physical and social actions of my dad who is not close to me. (Hitting people and cursing them out a few years ago) She said, I should HONOR my father, and that it makes HER look bad. Also she implied my flaws I did a few years ago (as a teenager) should be just as forgiven as my dad who slapped people. Mind you, I am 18, my dad is old af. 
It always turns back on to, ""those parents look so ugly, you should be glad you have a MOM who takes care of you, and isnt as bad as those other moms""

she also blames a lot on her previous marraiges + family life not working, thus ""shes never been treated right' and that i am a narcissist and am just like those people.

Its always about how i ruined her day and fucked her life up and my career wont work because i disrespect her so bad, thus my bad traits will effect it because ""you cant even treat your own mom right""

Anything goes wrong, my mom says ""of course everything goes wrong for me"", and both my mom and sister say ""nothing has EVER happened to you""
and 
""im one of the best moms, i would NEVER change a single thing that ive ever done""

shes also said, ""People probably look at you dressing like a little boy, and think it reflects on US because they probably think you were abused sexually""

Ever since I came out as trans as a kid, all i hear is that ""we know best"" , ""youre brainwashed"", ""youre sexist"", ""im embarrassed to be around you"", and all sorts of insulting transphobic things (its demonic, etc), im going to hell, that i should desist and be feminine, because it makes them look bad, and i make their life bad because of this.

1nz3eve,No contact for 9 months and they called my husband.,"Been LC with Nmom for over 2 1/2 years. NC and blocked completely for 9 months. Nmom called husband’s number to talk about insurance agreement we had in place many years ago. Decided not to renew the policy beginning 2026. 

Nmom called from Nsister’s phone to do this. I can hear Nsister whispering to Nmom entire time. She eventually asks how we are, how everything is… and my husband is being his regular people pleasing self. 🙄 he’s sharing too many details about our family. I’m pretending not to be in the room, not participating in the call. 

So I’m typing out prompts for how he needs to stop sharing so much with them, and being so kind to them, after their foul behavior towards me in recent months and years… which is why we’re NC. DUH!Eventually Nmom and Nsister start asking more about me and my life, and saying they soooo miss us, and wish we could talk again but they don’t know how to contact us or how to do anything. 

Husband is again being pleasing instead of calling them out on anything.. their hypocrisy, their performative ignorance, their fake concern for us, or cluelessness of how to contact us (AS THEY’VE CONTACTED US?!)

I had a moment of weakness and got on the call to say this. I didn’t yell, I wasn’t even hateful. And again, I hear Nsister whispering to Nmom. Nmom starts saying “I need to go… I didn’t call to argue… I can’t do this. I have to go. I still love you (fake vocal fry)” then hangs up. That was it. After 9 months of NC, she’s still performing this role of a victim and confused mother who doesn’t know the cause of all this conflict. She can’t be bothered to talk about it, and hangs up. 

I’m upset my husband was so pleasing and polite after everything she and my sister have put me through. He’s seen how painful this has been for me. I have nightmares every night about my family. I wake up crying or screaming out of my sleep because of all the stress and hurt surrounding them.  I’m also upset that I have them what they wanted. Even though I truly kept my composure, confronting them at all was enough for them to hang up on me. They think THEY’RE the sane ones cutting off a toxic family member. I was hopeful this might have been a turning point for them to realize through my husband how wrong they’ve been. And I don’t think I’ll get another opportunity like this again.

1nz20m0,Is it okay to lie to them in the interest of your own sanity?,"
35F, first time poster here. Just started therapy a year ago after a horrific trip I took with my bf to visit my family. I’ve been sober for a few years and have been really trying to heal. I have contact with my mom and low contact with my dad, and I love them both, but it’s complicated. Very. Also I’m an only child and I live in a different state now.
Mom is the bigger issue. She will show up for me emotionally and I start to get my hopes up that she’s changing, but it never lasts. She refuses to go to therapy (I have begged) and accountability is her number one opp, so I am trying to get better at knowing she just cannot be a person I can expect consistency or real apologies from and try to accept her limitations.
One of the biggest issues we have is that she gets fixated on things that are none of her business and she will hound me about them. It doesn’t matter what kind of headspace I’m in, if I’m having a bad day and not wanting to talk about xyz thing she wants to talk about, it MUST be discussed, and if I get mad because she won’t drop it, then I’m the problem.
Her current fixation is about me getting health insurance. I know this is a big deal and it is a priority for me, but I’m a waitress and I have to get on my partner’s insurance if I am going to get it at all. He is fine with this, but he just got it himself (he recently went from contract work with no insurance to full time employee with awesome benefits). We are not married yet so we hadn’t looked into the rules on how to get me on there yet. Our state doesn’t recognize common law marriage. This is something we planned to get done and look into this month, but I hadn’t told my mom that yet because over the summer she had brought it up and it turned into a huge argument. Every time she brings it up (multiple times over the last year or so), it turns into a huge argument. She tends to bring up stressful items for me to think about during the most inconvenient times. It’s not that I think it’s crazy my mom wants me to have health insurance. It’s her delivery. Right message, wrong time, wrong attitude. Very forceful. Like “okay well, you’re 35 so” and then proceeds to launch into every possible thing that could go wrong. And I will say things like “I’m handling it” and she’s like “but when?????” And harps on me. It’s like she wants what she wants when she wants it. She has always been like this, and I have always had to rise above and be the calm one. My patience runs thin as the years go on.

I feel tricked, and betrayed, and that’s what’s got me so down. She had been really supportive the last two weeks, and I was like maybe she’s finally starting to see how our relationship doesn’t have to be full of drama and tension, maybe she’s getting stronger. She knows that I am going through a job transition right now that is very hard for me, I’m struggling with a chronic illness that just won’t quit, I’ve recently lost a friend that feels like a breakup, and I’m actually quite depressed. I had a bad morning and decided to call her since I had the time, and she, knowing that I’m not feeling 100%, decides to launch into the whole “when are you getting health insurance?” Obsession out of nowhere again. I just said “I don’t want to talk about that right now. I’ve got a million other things going on right now, but I’m working on it” and then she starts digging at my age, that we’re not married yet, and keeps going. I stay strong in “yeah, I really don’t want to discuss this so I will have to go if you keep going.” Her favorite thing is to say that things are “just a simple question.” She LOVES saying that. “I’m just asking a simple question.” I ended up hanging up on her because she doesn’t listen. In my mind it doesn’t matter the subject, the argument is always the same. She brings something stressful, negative, upsetting up when I am ill equipped to handle it - I voice that I am establishing a boundary around not discussing xyz with her - she continues - I explain again that I will have to move on or hang up/leave - she continues and tells me it’s a simple question - I either start yelling at her (I’m ashamed to admit) or I remove myself from the situation - then she sends me a text with a fake apology. The cycle continues.

I really do intend to take care of this, I’m a very responsible person, it’s just not happening right this second. My chronic illness isn’t something I’m needing to go to the doctor for, so there’s no reason why she would need to worry this much. She says it’s because “what if something happens and I rack up thousands of dollars in medical debt” - I think she’s worried I would ask her for money, which really hurts my feelings. I would never expect her to do that and have said as much. She’s freaking out about hypotheticals! As usual. Both my parents are complete hypochondriacs and this is normal for them to spiral over things that “might” happen, then they put their worry on me. Always have. It’s why I don’t want children. I am exhausted.

My question is…how unethical is it to lie to her about these things so she shuts the fuck up? I have tried logical conversation, screaming back, being calm and collected, crying, grey rocking, talking to her like she’s my child, being honest, apologizing to placate her, I have tried EVERY technique under the sun. As part of my recovery I’m very resistant to lying because I just want to live a moral life, but after getting off the phone with her once she got me all worked up, feeling unloved and sobbing, I realize it would have been a lot easier to say “actually, you know what, I do have health insurance, I just forgot to tell you.” And let the whole thing die. Like should I just start lying to her???? To make my life easier??? I’m sick.

And I realize how weird this is, I hope you guys don’t judge me. But these are the things she gets upset about.

If you made it through all this, thanks for listening. Any advice is welcome but please no comments about how I need to get insurance, I’m very aware of how important it is.

1nz1lej,"What things do ur nparent(s) swear made them a great, fabulous patent?","My nmom is pushing 70 and was incredibly abusive in various ways. She’s truly a horrible person. Evil personified. Would tell me things no one should say to a child, beat me with heavy objects while getting ready for school and on the way to school and say if not for you, I could’ve been promoted at my job n be there earlier. I mean there’s a laundry list of abusive things she’s done. I even called CPS on her when I was 12 when she attacked me with a broom because I turned down the volume of a radio in her room while trying to do my homework. Oc they did nothing, but she was awful, since 4 years old I knew she was evil, not to trust her, and that I wanted nothing to do with her once I was an adult. I always knew she was the problem. 

She was also incredibly neglectful. While she was around, she was abusive but she was also neglectful and often not present. I’ve never had a relationship with her. And that’s her own fault. But yeah I’ve never had a mother-daughter relationship with her, no bonding, etc. My dad was the main caretaker, the one cooking, making my lunches for school, helping w homework and projects, staying home w me if I was sick. I don’t think my nmom ever cooked a meal once in her life for me as a child. 

Yet she swears she was mother of the year! Once in my 20s I told her something on the lines of you weren’t a good mom. She flew into rage. Yelling I was a great mom, I drove you to school everyday for 8 years since there was no bus. Lmaooo. And then proceeded to try and hit me for simply saying you weren’t a good mom. She literally thinks because she drove me to school (going to school is required by law), that that made her a GREAT mother. Even tho I was late nearly everyday cuz she was always running late and even though she was verbally and physically abusing me on the way to school. Yes, you were a GREAT mom for simply taking me to school. And I was a planned child, you knew ahead of time kids need to be enrolled in school. 

Like they say, good parents don’t go around saying they were good parents. Good ones usually doubt if they were good enough. Only a total loser would say I was a good mom, I took you to school everyday. There’s so much more things that would make someone a good mom. She wasn’t even present! She was abusive. Notice she didn’t say I was a good mom, I was supportive, I was loving, kind, always there for you etc. 

Straight delusional. I think back in her day she walked to school or something. So because she drove me to school, she thinks that’s really something special. Despite all else. And gets angry when u say the truth. The only time my enabling dad called her out was once. During my childhood I remember them arguing once and he said you’re an absentee mother! And she yelled and went psycho how am I an absentee mother?!, so he dropped the argument instead of hearing her yell and carry on.

(yes this is an example of what just happened to me) for example if they offer to make you eggs, dont bother telling how many eggs you want with it, theyre going to use however much you want, whether it's too much or too little. do i know why exactly? no. if youre in the kitchen doing some tasks such as peeling the potatoes while you're talking to them, if you respond incorrectly or too ""disrespectful,"" you're going to build up their fuel so they can yell at you. if you happen to leave the kitchen after youre done with the task, and you're doing another task, and don't immediatley come running when they say the food is done but instead call out back to them and say ""yeah,"" as in ""yeah, wait,"" they will release their anger upon you. ""HEY! You've been responding disrespectfully all morning! Don't talk to me like that. You better not be hanging out with stupid friends.""

They failed to realize you weren't responding disrespectfully, you were just scared and responding confused, with a hint of anger at how you were being treated, and you wanted to protect yourself with short, ""disrespectful"" responses. They don't realize that they were the one's speaking disrespectfully to you, saying phrases such as ""The fuck are you talking about?"" and when you mentioned you were hanging out with a friend later, you get asked ""Who?! Who is (insert friends name)?!"" asked in confusion and anger. 

Now you sit with the eggs they made, the juice they blended up for you, letting the eggs get cold. Nose a little wet from your quick crying session. I feel like when they cook for you like this, when they're in this specific mood more so, they don't cook out of love, but from their need of control over you. I didn't feel loved when they were cooking up the eggs. I felt pressured and scared.",bubbly_ttea,1759699797.0,65,0.96,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1nz0q1n/how_narcissists_use_food_for_manipulation/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1nz0q1n/how_narcissists_use_food_for_manipulation/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1nz0i67,My mom got really mad at me over our brunch plans and just stormed off. Not sure how to proceed.,"To give details, my mother and I made plans to have brunch at a popular restaurant. There’s 2 locations in the city (one close to her place and one close to mine). We agreed that we’d go to the one near her @ 12:30pm and walk around the nearby market and canal afterwards (this was discussed via text). 

The day of, I text her @ 12:00pm that I’m on my way (mind you, the resto is 15min away from me by car and I live in a big city full of traffic). So I head off, but obviously it’s taking longer than usual because of the traffic and then also now I have to find street parking in a busy area. All while this is happening, my mom arrives at the resto 15min in advance and is blowing up my phone about where I am, when will I arrive, if I’m far, that there’s parking near her, that there’s a long line at the resto, etc. And she’s constantly texting me her status in the line, but not in a way to update me but more like she’s annoyed with how close she’s getting to the end while I’m not yet there. I’m obviously not responsive because, well, I’m driving. 

By the time I arrive and I find parking (@12:40pm), I text her to just get seated and I’ll join her shortly because I’m paying the parking meter and I also parked a few blocks away so I need to walk back. Eventually, I arrive at the resto and she’s not there, so I call her and she goes off super furious about everything. And guess what, she was at the wrong resto. I try to talk to her to get her to tell me where she is and she’s not having it, she starts screaming at me through the phone and just hangs up. I call her back to locate her so we can just continue with the plans, but she answers and tells me she’s going home before hanging up again. I finally call one more time and she just repeats over and over “bye. bye. bye. bye. bye.” then proceeds to hang up once again. 

At this point, I’m done trying to resolve it so I head back to my car. She then texts me back not even 5min later to ask me where I went and that her bus has not arrived yet so we can now go to the resto like planned. I honestly just lied that I had already driven away and she just leaves me on read. I haven’t heard from her since and this was a few hours ago. 

To be honest, I’m used to this so I usually just leave her alone until she wants to see me again. But the issue is that I’m her ride to her hospital appointment in a few days, and I don’t know if I should just leave her on her own or bite the bullet and still accompany her. Any opinions or advice?

1nz004d,I finally left my family due to abuse and constant noise pollution - Xpost r/misophonia,"If you've seen my previous posts on here and the Raised by Narcissists subreddit, then you know my story. But, here's a short recap: 

I've had misophonia since I was 9 years old. My father would constantly smoke all day and cough so loud, it would wake me up in the morning and literally echo throughout the whole house. He used to physically abuse me any time I would yell or tell him to stop. 

Later on in life, my parents and I had to move into my brother's house because the landlord sold the house we lived in for 20+ years. 

My brother would also constantly smoke and cough so loud that he'd wake me up. He'd yell, ""It's my house, I can do whatever I want!"" 

My brother would also fight with his ex wife and then his mistress that he brought in. He'd party all night long and constantly make noise. 


Now here is the update: 

I worked my ass off at work and in school. I graduated with honors, built up my savings, and took a train out of state after landing a job two states away from my family. 

I would still talk to my mom on the phone, but she'd enter the room with my father, and he'd cough so loud I could hear it on the phone. 

I told her I would block her number if she exposed me to any of the noise pollution like coughing, yelling, partying, etc. 

My misophonia is severe and I also have C-PTSD. 

Well, today she took the phone into the room with my father and he coughed loudly. 

I immediately hung up and blocked her number.

I feel very bad about doing that, but I warned her and she overwrote my boundaries again. 

I'm fucking done. ",mods-begone,1759698073.0,2,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1nz004d/i_finally_left_my_family_due_to_abuse_and/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1nz004d/i_finally_left_my_family_due_to_abuse_and/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False

1nyylh9,"I'm in hospital, and NMother came to visit","I asked her to please not, as anyone who knows what narc mothers are like would understand.

Anyhoo, she came and the first thing she said was that she knows I'm unwell but surely I can brush my hair.  I politely explained that I have an abscess on my head so having nice hair is not a priority at the moment.  Then she saw the bald patch they had to shave and tut-tutted about that.

The nurses here are wonderful and whilst she was visiting they came to administer more drugs through my IV.  Unbelievably, she commented that they could at least brush my hair as I'm very upset about looking like ""that"".   LIES.  Amazingly, she didn't comment on my wonky stroke-looking mouth which might stay this way (my abscess was from a wisdom tooth extraction and traveled up to my skull and down to my neck, so I'm a big puffy mess).

I wish she hadn't come, but know she really wanted to so she'd have some (inflated) stories to tell others.  I only let her know I was here as the situation was high risk when I came in.

1nyyfsr,My father has been telling his students for years that I'm autistic,"My father is professor of psychology. He is also, in my opinion, a narcissist. Growing up, he was psychologically abusive - daily shouting matches, telling me I was a ""fuck-up"", telling me that my mother, who was much kinder, actually was ashamed of me and that I humiliated her with my behavior, etc. He was occasionally physically abusive, but that was very rare. He's the kind of guy that is always right, and incapable of admitting that he was wrong. He'd threaten me with violence if I cried while he yelled (""I'll give you something to cry about!"" with a fist a couple cm from my face). He's capable of being very charming and kind, but he's also capable of being extremely mean.

Still, I was always kind of proud of him, because he's a well known professor of psychology. His specialty is developmental disabilities and researching bullying,

For a few years now, mainly since he attacked and choked me (which he later apologized for - something he'd never done before), I've been low contact with him. The issue is that he's still married to my mom, and I still see him at family events. Still, I've done my best to gray rock him.

A few days ago, I was in a car for 3 hours with a new client. When I heard that she studied psychology in a previous career, I mentioned my father, and she asked his name. She told me she'd studied in a few of his classes. She must have picked up on how I felt about him, because she then told me some things.

She told me that many of his students don't really like him, and that in the yearly poll on student satisfaction he's generally quite poorly rated. She also told me that he generally picks one or two students that he likes, and everyone else gets a cold shoulder. That doesn't surprise me - I was always the black sheep, while my sister could do no wrong.

Finally, she told me he'd always talk about me and my sister. I asked her what he said about us, and she said that he would often say that he had an autistic daughter (me), and that made him especially sensitive to the needs of the disabled.

It was humiliating. Here I was with a new client, with hours on the road ahead of us, and she knows something about me that's intensely personal. I don't want people to know about my diagnosis... being seen as different is my greatest insecurity. In fact. I told my father that about 5 years ago - I told him that being seen as different is my ""greatest fear"".

I changed the subject, and kind of blanked out for the rest of the day, not thinking about it too much. But by morning I realized how humiliated I feel, how violated. She (the client) told me that my father told every new class this - she'd discussed it with students who were a year ahead and a year behind her. I feel like a prop for him to show how special and qualified he is in his profession.

He lives and teaches in the same city as me. I've met many dozens of his former students over the years, and he knows this. He knows that this is something I consider extremely private - but even if he didn't, he's a goddamn professor of psychology! Even without me telling him, he should have known that it was completely unethical to put my diagnosis out there to hundreds of students over two decades! I'm horrified, humiliated, and dumbfounded that my father would do this.

I always knew he was a terrible father, but I believed he was a good man, and an excellent professor - professional, ethical. I can't believe this is happening.

So I called a friend of mine and told him about this - telling him that I'm on the spectrum. **He told me he already knew** - a friend of his (that I don't know) is a former student of my father's and told him years ago.

How many times have I sat with a client or colleague or friend who knew this about me, judging me, evaluating my every word and body language in the context of ""of course she'd say that, she's autistic...""? Have I lost clients? Rumors are obviously out and about.

Has my father told people that I'm trans as well? I can absolutely see him telling people about his trans daughter to make himself seem more enlightened.

Today I spoke with a lawyer, just to figure out where I stand. Turns out that his disclosing my medical info to strangers without my consent is a violation of the law, and he can be sued both for defamation (despite it being true) and for violation of privacy laws. I don't intend to sue, but it was good to know exactly how things stand.

I've written a letter to my father:

___

> Dad,

> It has recently come to my attention that you, regularly and repeatedly, have been telling classfuls students that you have an autistic daughter, and that because of this you are especially sensitive to people with special needs.

> 

> This is a gross violation of my privacy - and deeply hypocritical given our history.

> 

> You and I live in the same city. On numerous occasions, you and I have discussed current and former students of yours that I have met - as colleagues, clients and neighbors. You only have two daughters - it does not take a genius to put two and two together and realize that it was me you were speaking of. I now know that you have regularly, to each new class, told your students about me. I know this because I recently spent over three hours in a car with a former student of yours who, when she realized I was your daughter, instantly knew something intensely personal and private about me. Furthermore, she told me that other students in other years have discussed your autistic daughter amongst themselves.

> 

> While preparing this email I spoke with a friend who I had never told about my diagnosis. Upon telling him the story, he informed me that he already knew - a few years ago, a friend of his mentioned your class, and specifically mentioned that you had an autistic daughter. My friend connected the dots and understood that I was the autistic daughter in question. He never mentioned this to me, as he felt that it was a violation of my privacy that he even knew. I assume that many other people have reached the same conclusion - and that by telling people that I am your daughter, I've outed myself repeatedly.

> 

> I have told you at least once in a very emotional conversation that my diagnosis is something intensely private. You may remember that on the train platform on the way back from Long Island to our Airbnb in Queens, I told you that people knowing this about me was, quote, ""my greatest fear"". Even if you do not remember me specifically telling you this, you should have known that my diagnosis was not your story to tell, especially to people who could later meet and identify me. You are smart enough, well trained enough and have enough experience to know for a fact that the information you have disclosed about me in your classes was personally identifiable, and that this disclosure was unethical and unacceptable. In fact, any reasonable person would know that sharing this information was wrong.

> 

> Your usage of me as a prop to position yourself as a champion of the rights of developmentally disabled persons is deeply hypocritical - for multiple reasons.

> First, the very fact that you told your class about me is a violation of the privacy of one of the very individuals you claim to be especially sensitive towards. That this is your daughter makes it even worse.

> Second, our relationship throughout my childhood is hardly one in which you were especially sensitive to my unique needs. I am not going to go into detail on my childhood as it's off topic, but you know what I'm referring to.

> Finally, I know you have discussed this with classes of yours as recently as 2022 and 2023. I remind you that this was after you grabbed me by the neck and choked me.

> 

> Have you also told people other personal things about me? Have you mentioned that I am transgender? Have you mentioned my occupation? Have you mentioned my name? Have you mentioned that I live in [city]? I do not know, as the two students I have been in communication with (so far) did not remember. Anything you have told your students, colleagues, friends or acquaintances about me without my consent is a gross violation of my privacy.

> 

> I feel supremely violated. You knew for an absolute certainty I regularly meet your students current and former. And yet, you persisted to regularly and repeatedly disclose private facts about me to dozens and dozens of people, over at least a decade that I'm aware of.

> 

> Frankly, I'm astonished that I need to write this email at all. This whole discovery was horrifying, humiliating and shocking. I am horrified by the number of times I have apparently outed myself by (somewhat) proudly telling people that you are my father. I am deeply humiliated at the fact that many times, after linking myself to you, people must have been evaluating every word I said in the context of ""autistic daughter"". 

> 

> Going forward, You are not to discuss me with your classes. Do not mention an autistic daughter. Do not mention a transgender daughter. Do not mention an autistic or transgender family member at all, as any of these things could be traced back to me. **In fact, you are not to mention me in any way, shape or form, either in generalities or in specifics, to anyone at any time, in any context.** If someone asks you a specific question about me, answer tersely and change the subject. After this revelation, I do not trust your judgement.

> You are welcome to discuss me however you like with immediate family and with any therapist or doctor who is legally sworn to secrecy. Besides these exceptions, keep me and anything about me out of your conversations.

> 

> [signature]

The new semester starts soon, and I want to send this email to him before then. I know he'll find some way to deflect, or say that I'm overreacting.

So am I overreacting? I feel like I could go much further. I could have my lawyer send a letter. I could go straight to a lawsuit. I could add a whole section to the letter going into the various abuses and humiliations of my childhood. I've decided not to do those things, because I don't think it'll help anything. But maybe I should just send a very short note saying in essence ""I understand you regularly tell your classes about me. Don't do that."" But I'm also really mad, and hurt, and I feel so violated. I don't know if I can bring myself to skip how his behavior has made me feel - even though it's absolutely not in keeping with ""gray rock"". I'm also sure that this email will make things very hard between us.

I don't know. Maybe I should just send the short note. I'm doubting myself.

1nyy4og,"Those of you who are chronically unemployed due to a disability, and dealing with family members with an addiction problem, how do you deal with it?","So I seen something interesting [https://www.reddit.com/r/FoxBrain/comments/1gbebj8/my\_parents\_always\_have\_fox\_news\_on/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoxBrain/comments/1gbebj8/my_parents_always_have_fox_news_on/)

>Fox News is like fentanyl

I know it isn't the same. Like I delt with a drug addict and them being physically dangerous. Sometimes I still have to interact with them (my sister) since I take care of her kids. But all day and all night it is

* Cop videos or people having their skulls split
* Murder videos (like the crime stuff) luckily this chilled out some, but when it does flare up it can be REALLY bad.
* Fox News primary, but sometimes OAN, NewsMax, CNN, etc. And in this I constantly hear CONSTNAT name calling, conspiracy, etc. Hell when the thing where Trump announce the thing with us, Fox was the one cheering it on as he found the cure for us. At one point when I asked them to watch something else once in a while, they started calling me woke.
* My mom use to drown herself in Reality Housewives.
* They switch to some conspiracy political videos now and then. Many times these YouTubers that report fear the entire time they are on.

NOTE: The only time they don't watch it is at dinner. It is because I flat out 100% refuse to eat or be around them when they have that stuff playing. I've flat out many times tell them how the CONSTANT negative emotional atmosphere is harming me. I have tried to work with them on it for multiple decades, but my mental state between having literally no way out, my sister coming over causing physical harm to the place, yelling to the top of her lungs, threaten, etc because her relations with drugs and drinking. Being called a failure to launch on TV and literally by some of my family when TV started spouting that, my mom goes pure ape shit over literally nothing. Like I mean literally nothing. I even have security video of multiple events of it.

But at least during those few moments they aren't, but even then it is constantly being brought up.....

And this is after years of them yelling at me saying I'm the one with anger issues if I don't eat. Somehow them yelling and treating me like shit is me being angry? Or the fact they lie in a split second and manipulate.

Note: last week I tried seeing if text helps when they get like this since I can write clearer than I speak. For one if they don't like what I say or just want to mess with me they say they don't understand me. But another is in an emotional state it the brain to mouth messes up so I forget how to say given words to the point some in the past have thought English is my second language. And they flat out told me they refuse to read them.

I would love to move, but I can't afford it. Likely will never be able to afford it. They been like this since I was a kid and it only has gotten worse since time has went by. I tried introducing them to other things, but like this one person said

>Same with the fox always being on. My dad leaped into the 21st century a couple of weeks ago and got himself a Roku. He was telling about all the cool stuff he's found. He says, ""the only thing that sucks is I can't figure out how to watch Fox on this thing. "" I said very gently, 'dad, maybe that's not such a bad thing?? ' he started to scream at me like he's never screamed before. ""I need to be informed!! How dare you think I shouldn't care if they are going to bring California here to Indiana!! ” When I was finally allowed to speak I said ” dad I was just trying to tell you that channel makes you a little angry."" LOL

And like this,

>My gram has it on constantly. I mean constantly. I can’t even use our living room, I stay in my room mostly. I can hear her yell and swear every time Kamala or Joe comes onscreen or is even mentioned. If that wasn’t bad enough, I stopped watching anything with her or hanging out in general because everything is an opportunity to make a comment on democrats or the “woke” liberals. Like we watched a Hallmark movie last Christmas which had a gay couple as background characters and she made a nasty comment. It makes me sad because I can’t hang out with my own grandma. My mom is the same but I never see her because she works, but I can’t share anything about my life or share an opinion on the state of the world without it being made into a political statement.

Last night when we were eating my mom had some documentary of the local place on. The person said something wrong (he mistaken on how a given place got it's name). And then for the next 10 minutes I had to hear about ""woke"" this ""woke"" that and my dad making jokes about it.

Like my problem is if it isn't some political crap, it is real world murder or violence (yes there is a difference. Did you know unlike in movies people just don't fall over when they get shot, there is a ton of blood, etc), if not this then it is someone yelling, if it isn't this it is someone online screaming, if it isn't any of that then so on.

I swear to god if I have to spend another year like this then I'm going to walk  the train tracks until one hits me or completing my exit bag and taking myself out.

All I want is to be in an environment that isn't nearly 10000000% of the time negatively emotionally charged. As far as the only ways I can see it ending is me going homeless or taking my life.

Note I came across that link because I've been looking around on how to weaned them off the drama porn. This is where I seen someone basically note it is basically like an additive drug to some, and it 100% is. I haven't found a way to wean them off. Like my boundaries are completely steam rolled over. And like right now, they are in the kitchen which is where they are primary watching this. You can hear it through the floor, but also throughout the entire downstairs. Like I can't even make me anything to eat, feed the stray cat, or whatever without having to deal with it. Sometimes they even try to drag me into it.

I started reading the texts about me and it was very hurtful. Keep in mind they have been extremely physically and psychologically abusive since i was around seven yeara old, and dont do anything in that degree to my older or younger brother. They call me spoiled for asking for a bra in my size so i can feel comfortable and always make fun of me and call me the daughter from hell. Cps doesnt do anything at all despite the evidence. My mom sent a text message to my dad: ""I don't have any more energy left or care to take care of her""
""I wish that she was never fucking born. I hate her.""
""I don't want her living in our home anymore. She's making my life awful.
She just makes everyone everyone's life terrible she doesn't bring any happiness or positivity to our family. All she does is cause a dark cloud over us and problems and stress.""
""She is a spoiled brat you're right
She is not anything I ever hoped for in a child or a daughter for that matter""
Keep in mind this was because i was late for the bus as my phone is broken and my alarm wont go off. And because i asked for a bra in my soze and a jacket for the winter rbecaue i have none. She keeps talking about how self absorbed i am and then my mom and dad especially makes fun of me for not looking like the othwr girls at school and the fact that my depression impairs my ability to take care of myself.

1nyx6wi,Narcissistic relative as landlord,"Hello! 

I'm sorry for any typo, English isn't my mother language. 

We're renting a flat from my n-grandfather since 2019.
It was awful from the beginning, but we stayed. 
This week he reached out again and this situation was the turning point. For my and my families mental health, we have to move out as soon as possible. 

We have to give notice 3 months in advance. A lot of time for him to plot something. 

So how was your experience, when your narcissistic relative was your landlord? How was the time until the moving date? 

..and hopefully, how good is it now? Was it worth it? 

Thank you so much and all the best!

1nyww10,Be a scapegoat or be lonely?,"Idk, my parents, I don't even have any expectations from them anymore. I have created a physical distance. And that has helped a lot, because I used to become the central ""problem"" of fights where I had nothing to do at all.
But my golden child older sibling and her spouse, I try to meet them on and off just to have some kind of relationship.
But then, after a couple of days it becomes the same, if I'm not doing things her way, I'm not doing things wrong. It needs to match HER schedule, her convenience, should be closer to her place, should have her kids and everything accommodated. I can take it for a day or two.. But not more than that. 
I even said no to an all expenses paid foreign trip she wanted to take me to, because I knew I'd be paying in my mental peace instead. So I gothere once a while. Recently I was somehow given the blame of them being late to a party (they are ALWAYS late anyway) just because I was also going there. 

My younger sibling (the one who gets a special treatment irrespective of how he behaves) has started being especially rude to my parents and everyone else he thinks don't have anything worthwhile for him to use.  So I've kind of become extremely low contact with him. 

And I don't get along with MOST people, I'm not saying its not a me problem, maybe it is. Because everywhere I go, people just expect things to be their way or the highway. Or maybe its just me who is afraid to fall into such prisons again.

1nyw7kw,Nmom and siblings creating baby shower drama,"I (33F) am almost 28 weeks pregnant with my first child and live about a thousand miles away from most of my family. My aunt (my dad’s sister), who I’m closer with than my actual mother (Nmom) has been organizing a baby shower for me over Zoom, which was supposed to be just a small celebration with my dad’s side of the family. 

Some important background info: My Nmom was not invited to the shower 1) because of how she treats me, my husband, and my dad’s entire side of the family, and 2) because she and my dad are divorced, and this shower was intended to celebrate with my dad’s side of the family, which she isn’t a part of anymore. Btw, I was not involved in making the guest list.

I have three brothers who don’t understand what my experience with my Nmom was like and who frequently criticize the boundaries I have put in place to keep some distance from Nmom. My brothers’ significant others were all invited to the shower because my aunt thought they should be included as part of the family. I really like my brothers’ girlfriends; they are all very nice people. But I was honestly pretty nervous about them being invited because Nmom has a long history of triangulating my brothers against me, and I had a feeling my brothers would tell Nmom about the shower. 

I got a call from my aunt yesterday saying that my Nmom found out about the shower (because one of my brothers told her about it, which I KNEW would happen) and was really mad that she wasn’t invited. Apparently Nmom was complaining to my brother whose girlfriend was invited, then nmom got him to call my dad, and then my brother started telling my dad to tell my aunt to include Nmom. Apparently Nmom and my brother were talking behind my back about how cruel I am to exclude Nmom from the shower because “this is her first grandchild” and they were wondering who’s been “coaching” me to distance myself from her.

Again, my parents are divorced, and this was supposed to be a shower with just my dad’s side of the family. I had no hand in making the guest list. But as always, I’m being cruel, and everything is about Nmom.

My aunt ended up telling my dad that there was no way we were going to include Nmom in the shower and that she’d be sending out a cancellation notice to everyone. The part my Nmom and brothers don’t know is that the shower is still on; my aunt is going to send out a new invitation that won’t include my brothers’ significant others. So basically it’ll just be me, my aunts, and my cousins on my dad’s side.

I don’t really know what I’m looking for here; I guess I really just needed a place to vent/maybe some validation. I’m thankful that my aunt is still finding a way to make this all work, but extremely frustrated with Nmom and my brothers. This shower is supposed to be about me, my husband, and our baby, but as usual, Nmom is trying to make everything all about her. (For context, she also tried to wear white to my wedding and has ruined virtually everything birthday, every holiday, etc., ever since I was little.) I’ve made my boundaries extremely clear (for example, she’s not allowed to stay at our house because of her past treatment of my husband and I, and I’m VLC with her, meaning I don’t take phone calls from her and only sometimes respond to texts from her, depending on the situation). I’m just so angry that Nmom and my siblings went behind my back, talking about how I’m “being cruel” and trying to force me to have Nmom at a shower she isn’t supposed to be a part of. 

If anything, this whole debacle is just another reminder of why I’m VLC with Nmom and will be limiting her access to my daughter when she’s born. I don’t ever want to allow her the chance to hurt my kids the way she’s hurt me, my husband, and countless other people I love. But it’s also making me realize how much I can’t trust my siblings either as they are basically her flying monkeys. Again, not really sure what I’m looking for here, just needed to vent to people who might understand how I’m feeling (and maybe a little validation that I’m not the AH here?).",081714da,1759689441.0,3,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1nyw7kw/nmom_and_siblings_creating_baby_shower_drama/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1nyw7kw/nmom_and_siblings_creating_baby_shower_drama/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False

1nyv22s,2.7 years out. Talking to my father feels like taming an animal.,"See title.

There is no such thing about being quite 'adept' at it. I was not 'skilled' enough to leave. I wanted it enough. 

I fear sharing details. I fear, vulnerability. I've already deleted and reworked the first two sentences of this post enough times, to, I don't know.

I want to make myself clear, enough. Where I stand, scared to share even my age, but, he's rather one to not search here. These are my hands.

I begged him for money to pay rent. 

This is the only time it has happened.

It was because I misplaced some important items. It's funny. Still. I had (and have) the money. I ask myself to slow down here. I reworked a sentence or two. 

My fear is warranted. 

To clarify: I had/have the money, but.. a compromised bank account or two, and I found myself with little financial awareness. Meek. No way to cash checks. A sole safety net. 

Begging for money to pay rent. 

I came to him honestly. I don't need to say that he called me names. I - do, maybe. You might not know what he says. That's okay. 

I rework the past sentences, as if he was watching. 
Again, though tired, my fear is warranted. 

I don't want you or myself to get lost here.

            I begged him and he cooperated. It took some days. It's taking today, too. I'm convincing him to work with me.

Truth is, he will likely send an alarm, my way. I'm not preparing for it literally, with research. It would be a waste of fear. 

I'm eating oatmeal now, for breakfast.. lunch, brunch. I find myself wanting to reassure you, that I am okay.

1nyuulc,"To my nMom and nDad, this post is for you!","This post is made so I (25M) can document my feelings and when the time comes and I finally go NC, I have nothing to feel guilty for because truthfully speaking, they have created their own problems and karma has finally gotten back and bitten upon them! 

nMom: wow, I don't have any words to describe about you. You have successfully (in quotes) managed to manipulate and take advantage of my feelings as a child by painting yourself as a victim and projecting my dad as a villain, and switching sides depending on how the situation favors you. You deserve to be left alone in your golden years. My earliest recall of this was when I was 11 or 12 years old when you discovered through letters thrown in the ""trash room"" that my dad ""cheated"" and had an affair with a Muslim woman for 4 years before getting married to my mom. I wished you would have sought counseling or individual therapy then and there itself. You would have been far better and would have had an earlier start in rebuilding your career and identity. Because truth to be told, NO ONE asked you to quit your career and be a housewife full-time, no one asked you to stay in a toxic marriage filled with hatredness, anxiety, and just constant walking on eggshells. No one asked you to project your feelings and insecurities you've had with your relationship with my dad against me. It's you — whether by choice or by forced situation, that you still continue to be in this toxic relationship. How many times you've allowed and given space for my dad to physically, mentally, verbally, and psychologically abuse you!? And yet you still chose to stay because ""what will others say""!? What will others say have no business or bearing on you because they're not living your life. You've learned to lean on the ""sacrifice"" card to get things the way you've wanted. To me, that's not sacrifice. If you have to guilt your son (me who was 14 at that time) with ""I provided food water shelter"" every single time, you've failed as a parent. No person will ever weaponize their sacrifices against a child. I didn't ask to be born!

nDad: truthfully, you deserve to be left in a homeless elderly shelter. You think providing your kid with the basic necessities financially and disappearing from my childhood means you've won the Nobel Peace Prize award!? Wow, the standards of parenting has stopped down to such a low level! You look so menacing, fierce, scary, and just a horrible person to be around with. How many times have I watched you abuse my mom, and how I wanted to save the situation as a child but there was nothing I could have done. All you did as a child was you would go drink with friends and come home till 2am or 3am on weekends and not be there for the family. And now you have the audacity to go tell to these people that ""you've been a part of my life!?"" And even better, you used holidays and vacations as an excuse to portray a happy family picture. Wow, I wish I have good words for you. 

Now me, I'm planning to go NC as soon as possible where circumstances favor me. The decision to go NC was alresdy long made a few years ago when I was in college, and is NON-NEGOTIABLE. With the crippling job market and economy, I know I'm still capable of finding success without both my nMom and nDad. You both have shown your true colors many times and I bet you are waiting for the opportunity to use my successes and accomplishments as an adult to continue boosting your fragile egos. As a child, I had no choice. As an adult, I have the right and choice to decide which information to share. And you've demonstrated to me that you are not capable of encouraging your adult son during tough times like the job market situation, but at the same time, you have no qualms bragging about my achievements to others to make yourself feel better about yourselves.

1nytpw5,I went no contact with my family a year ago. How do I stop missing them?,"27F. I’ve had no contact with my family for a year.

I was treated like the scapegoat in my family — always blamed, always punished, while my younger brother was favored. He is 7 years younger than me. My mother was always quite aggressive towards me, though not physically. My father never had a relationship with me, to the point that if he asked me how I was or how school was going, it was because my mother had ordered him to.

I experienced the loss of all my relatives, not because they died, but because my mother broke all ties with everyone except my maternal grandparents (her parents). I never saw my cousins, whom I spent my childhood with, or my aunt, who gave me much more attention than my parents, ever again.

I was always an excellent student, getting 9s and 10s (out of 10). My brother, throughout his life, just barely passed until he ended up having to repeat a year. Even so, I was the ""hard worker"" and he was the ""intelligent one,"" because when he was 4 years old, they gave him an IQ test and he scored 130.

At home, they said I was my brother's ""little mom."" I took care of him, perhaps even more than his own mother, who was a stay-at-home mom, by the way. He would pull normal childish pranks and then blame me, like painting my name misspelled on the wall. Then he would blame me, and my parents would believe him. Mind you: this was never his fault; he was 3 and I was 10. I only mention it to highlight how ridiculous it was that they thought I, at 10 years old, would have done that, and I would end up being punished even though it was obvious he had done it.

When he became a teenager, he would insult me and began to despise me. I remember explaining math to him and him directly calling me ""retarded"" and saying that if I got good grades it was because I was a ""nerd"" or ""grind."" It hurts me that our relationship degenerated so much due to the influence of my parents, especially after I had taken care of him when I was just a child myself. My father did have a relationship with him, a close one; he would take him fishing and they always did everything together. The difference was enormous. When I was 5 years old, I would ask him to play with me and he would tell me I was too old for that.

When I started university, I wasn't allowed to choose my degree, even though I had the grades to get into any program. I wasn't allowed to study Computer Engineering because that's what my father did, and he said to me: ""What are you trying to do? Be like me?""
I quit swimming and my hobbies for my studies, and it was all for nothing.

When I moved to another city to study, my mother started attacking me. She would call me to tell me I couldn't handle life and constantly insulted me. I developed an eating disorder (ED), was diagnosed with anxiety and depression, and was prescribed a lot of medication that left me in a daze for 4 years, until I finished my degree remotely (they took me out of the in-person university), completely isolated in my hometown.

During this time, I met my partner, who is Black and from a humble background. My mother started stalking me. I couldn't leave the house; as soon as I did, she would call me constantly to see who I was with. She insulted my boyfriend, whom she never wanted to meet, and told me that everyone was criticizing me to the point that I felt ashamed to go out in public. I gained weight due to the situation; I was forbidden from going to the gym, and going out scared me. My clothes stopped fitting, and until I started working, I had to wear things that weren't my size and made me feel even worse about myself.

Several psychologists told her that I couldn't study at home, so she would change my doctor as soon as they suggested she might be doing something wrong. During this time, my maternal grandfather, who was my real father figure, passed away. I used to visit my grandparents a lot, using a family car that no one else used. They sold the car shortly before he died, and I couldn't go see them on my own anymore. My grandmother and I grew very close, and then my mother started telling her that I was ""with a Black guy"" and poisoning her against me until my grandmother started insulting me and our relationship broke down.

Three years have passed since that last event. This is the first year I've lived alone with my partner. It has been a tough year because I have many wounds to heal. I ""escaped"" from home because I no longer felt safe; my father developed an alcohol addiction, my mother would give me the silent treatment for three weeks and wouldn't let me cook or do my laundry when she was angry... I rented an apartment with my partner and simply left one day without warning. I had been slowly emptying my room and I secretly bought a car to put all my things in and leave.

After all this, I suffer immensely because I think about the good moments, about the family I wish I had had, and I don't know how to stop suffering because of this. I wish we could have a normal or at least cordial relationship, that they could meet my partner. I think about those possibilities. In the end, I didn't cut off contact; it was my mother who stopped talking to me when I left and asked me to return the keys, even though there are still some of my things there.

1nyrr9h,"Once you see it, you can’t unsee it! Never doubt your instincts, they were forged in the fire of being raised by narcissists!","So when I finally figured out what was going on with my parents a few years back, I was doing deep reflection and realized that a few of my very closest friends were quite similar to my nmom.

I went VLC with my nparents as well as those friends. Communication ultimately trailed off entirely with the friends.

Then about a month ago, one of them reached out to me after her cat died, my heart went out to them, so I had a conversation with them and comforted them.

We haven’t really stayed in touch much after that, but then today they called and I decided to answer. We had a brief conversation in which they let me know that their partner might have cancer. They had just had a biopsy and were waiting for results. I told them I was so sorry and that it sounded scary. 

The next thing they said was that they had a lot of travel planned for work and they hoped their partner didn’t expect them to cancel travel and be there for them if it was serious. Also that they hoped this wouldn’t change their appearance because they really really loved their partner’s appearance.

😱

Y’all.

If I ever doubted my take on this person, this nbehavior on full display…well…it was confirmed. 

All this to say, trust yourselves, my fellow raised by narcissists! You have earned your intuition. You know what’s right for you. You deserve good, kind people in your life. 🙌🏾

1nyrkkb,I feel like I’m cursed or the unluckiest person alive,"Hi everyone. I don’t even know where to begin, but all my life I’ve felt extremely unlucky in some way. I’m a 28F from a South Asian family, and this post might be long, but I really need to get it off my chest.

When I was a kid, I was relentlessly bullied from ages 7–14. I would hide in the bathroom stalls during recess so no one would see how alone I was. Kids would touch me and then pass my “germs” around as if I was some kind of disease. It didn’t stop there, whenever I visited Bangladesh (where my parents are from), my cousins also bullied me. They treated me like an outsider, while other Bengali Americans I know have nothing but warm, loving memories of their cousins. I’ve never had that. My cousins are all close with each other, but I’ve always been the weak link, the outsider.

My home life was also toxic. My mom and brother (39M) have infantilized me my whole life. I’ve never really been allowed to have autonomy or a sense of self. My brother was (and is) controlling and emotionally abusive — humiliating me in front of family, yelling at me, belittling me, treating me like a dumb kid even at 28. My sister (42F) was also emotionally abusive. In 2017, she read my diary, found something I wrote out of frustration, and things escalated so badly that she physically attacked me, called me degrading names, and even called the cops on me. I got arrested, had a restraining order, and was forced to stay away from my family for six months, yet everyone told me I had to forgive *her* because she’s older. Even now, she verbally abused a few months ago simply because I told her to turn off her 5am alarm.

My mom has always enabled this. She babied me, gave me no privacy (I shared a room with her until age 27), and never defends me when I’m mistreated. She takes my brother’s side, imposes an 8 pm curfew on me even now, and makes me feel guilty if I’m even a little late. My dad just goes along with whatever my brother says. I can’t even tell my family about my dream of teaching abroad before grad school because they still treat me like a 5-year-old who can’t do anything alone.

All of this has affected my friendships and relationships. I seem to attract toxic people, get taken advantage of, or end up being mistreated. I get overly attached to people who show me even basic kindness and fall into limerence, so now I don’t have any close friends or dating experiences. I feel like I’ve never had a time where I felt truly loved or deeply happy.

I’ve tried therapy, but both therapists I connected with ended our sessions (not because of me), and I haven’t found someone compatible since. Sometimes the emotional pain is so much that I s\*\*\* h\*\*\*. I feel unlovable and like I was meant to be forever alone.

I’m not sure why I’m even making this post, maybe to see if anyone has had similar experiences or just to finally let some of this out. If you’ve read all this, thank you so much. I genuinely wish you days filled with warmth and happiness.

**TL;DR:** I’m a 28F who was bullied as a kid, mistreated by cousins abroad, and raised in a toxic family that still controls and belittles me. This has left me feeling unloved, unlucky, isolated, and like I always attract toxic people. I’ve tried therapy but haven’t found someone stable. I’m sharing this to see if anyone relates or has similar experiences.",sheriecherie,1759678963.0,5,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1nyrkkb/i_feel_like_im_cursed_or_the_unluckiest_person/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1nyrkkb/i_feel_like_im_cursed_or_the_unluckiest_person/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1nyr7mh,I hate my mom,"I genuinely hate my mom. She never liked me since my birth. Apparently she wanted a boy and I’m a girl. And she didn’t even bother to wake up console me at night when I was a new born. It was too tiring for her and my dad and grandma were the people who fed me formula and kept consoling me singing lullabies. 

I don’t have a single good memory of her. I’m 36 now. She always picked fights with dad, dad’s family, her family. Everyone around them. No one actually liked her. When someone proves she is wrong she used to cry out loud publicly and try to play the victim.

There are tons of horrible things she had done to me. She cut my hair while I was sleeping when I was grade 7. Because I needed to focus on my studies not my looks. And she took a loan in my name saying it was for our wedding from a relative. I remember keeping me in room without opening the door because I didn’t say sorry to her. I was four by the way. 

She never liked my husband and he’s a sweetheart. Never asked a single thing about my one year old baby. I started working as a software engineer from 25 and she always bothered me with money and so I gave her an allowance to stay away from her.

Since I have a kid I left my job last year and planning to go back to work from next January. So I haven’t gave her much money like I used to. Now she’s calling my family members and telling them she has bad heart/ damaged heart valve or something and I need to send some money. And my uncle is saying I need to forgive her no matter what she’s my mom. I literally don’t care whether she died or not. I just want to stay away from my family and keep my peace. 

The reason I kept her blocked recently because as last straw she faked my signature in some documents in sold our family home. To pay for my sister’s new get rich quick idea. 

My dad and grandma passed away years ago. I just want to keep my mom and my sister away from me. Since the blocking isn’t working. I don’t know what to do anymore.

1nyqho6,Problematic father,"Okay so I (19 M) have abit of a problem. my dad is one of those people that had to live through the harsh environment of foster care in the 70s and 80s. His mother and father were alcoholics and basically forced him and his 2 brothers and sister into care. The siblings were split apart and put in different homes, Only 2 stayed together. he was always in trouble when he was younger, smoking drinking ect. He didn’t excel in school either. Long story short a little shit in primary and secondary and a bad start in life. My mother and father never married, were only together for about 3 years and within that time had myself and my sister (16 F) From what I’ve been told by my great grandmother, my father didn’t bother with my sister until she was 3. (Only bothering when My mother took my dad to court about monthly child maintenance.) he does bother now and I respect that but that in itself I cannot forget and won’t. Me and my sister don’t really get along, on my dads side there not close at all. My auntie is plagued by alcaholism caused by not having children, basically sent her mad. My other 2 uncles then. One is a lowlife who achieved nothing but steal from my auntie when he needed help. And the other is actually okay, just served in the military and is very stuck in his ways. Basically a little temper and is firmly the man of his house and controls my cousin like a soldier, with him being the general. 

My dad is one of those people that are scarred by the issues that he dealt with in his childhood, ( His whole family ) not that he really had one and I understand this. However, I believe he’s stuck in the past but is too afraid to admit it. My father is also a very angry man, I could sit here all day and go on about my father but I’m not going too. I’m just gonna go on about what he does as I need to know weather I need to get the fuck out of there or just continue.


He still treats me like a little boy, I will do something so tiny to annoy him like accidentally forgetting to put something in the wash and he loses it. Shouting calling me every name under the sun, he has these moments of rage where he slams his fists onto the table or come really close up to my face when we are arguing. He’s played video games his entire life even into his 50s (Destiny 1 and 2 ) and when he dies he shouts the entire house down. Mind you he’s been doing this basically my entire life and how I haven’t got PTSD from the constant shouting is a medical mystery. He also plays mind games with me, he has habits of rage and then calms down and tells me that I was in the wrong for setting him off. Fair enough if I do something to you then fair enough but he will go down to the local pub which happens to be also my local pub. And tell everyone what a bad person I am, that I’m getting nowhere in life and that “He’s failed as a father” in a room full of people I know (My local town is one of those British towns where everyone knows everyone) 

It’s his shouting and screaming I cannot handle, his playing of mind games. Coming across as Mr Innocent while I look like the criminal to locals. People know what he’s like from my mother also coming from the same town, however this has to stop. I can’t keep being emotionally abused, called every name under the sun and being blamed for everything. I’m quite an emotionally strong person but I fear I’m starting to crack, I can just feel it. I don’t know weather to run away or not, I’ve got the money but I like the town I’m from (My mother lives a good 40 miles away from my home town and I stay with my mother on the weekdays and then my dad on the weekends) but this can change to either a full week at dads or a full week at mums. 

Everything I’ve done he’s doubted or said something bad about

Theory test: won’t pass it your too dumb, passed first time

Practical: You’ll never learn to drive, passed second time. And you can imagine the grilling I had for failing first. 

Part time job: you can’t even stick at that ( I quit because I went into full time work)

Full time work: Your a failure look at the job you’ve got (Even though it’s paying 400 a week after tax, not the greatest but manageable, he’s a digger driver…) 


And don’t get me started on school, I got Cs and Bs in GCSE which he was okay about. Six form I’ll admit I spent 1/10 of it in the pub but so did everyone else in six form. (For those who aren’t British, this is quite a normal thing for 17 and 18 year old students to drink in the pub after their lessons or their timetable has free lessons in the afternoon, illegal of course but it’s the UK) I got all A* but one D and he lost it, claiming that I’d gotten nowhere in life and that I would be a bum. 

Everything I’ve done he’s doubted or talked me down about, my entire life I’ve been shouted and yelled and put down. The only person who believed I would get as far as I would was my great grandmother, who id walk to every time my father was shouting and on the rare occasions I’d have to stay the night in fear of his anger. She passed away at the start of the year and ever since he’s been saying “ can’t run of to Granma’s every-time we argue now”  

He’s not angry all the time. And he can be a good dad, but 9/10 he’s angry about something and takes it out on people, I think he suffers with mental health but he’s never had it diagnosed and the times  I mention it to him that really sets him off, 

What do I do? Is there a word for what type of man my father is? Other than the obvious words that spring to mind? What do I do from here?

1nypvti,Restraining order,"Well it’s finally come to this. I’ve been NC with my parents for a year. My Nmom got my new address and has sent me unwanted mail quarterly. She showed up to my property this past Friday unannounced and acting with aggressive body language but no outward or direct threats were made. I did not speak to her directly but luckily my husband was home and went outside to speak with her and ask her to leave. 

We both felt threatened by her actions and behavior so I filed a police report after she left on her own accord. She walked around the property before leaving poking her head into windows. I have ring camera footage, the unwanted mail, the police report, and documentation from my therapist and 2 doctors mentioning long lasting injuries and mental health issues from physical abuse and medical neglect in my childhood. The police and my therapist advised me to get a restraining order. 

We are struggling to get by and have no money for a lawyer. Where I am, it is not required to have a lawyer to file for a restraining order, however, I know my Nmom will lawyer up and try to fight it immediately when she’s served as she has more access to resources and is in a way better place financially. 

This is causing me massive anxiety and fear, but I do have resources for pro bono attorneys and victim’s advocates. Anyone have any experience with this?

She also has a private account, so I used her adding herself on my account to my advantage to look through her posts and followers. I found 2 separate posts of me when I was maybe 7 years old, sleeping. Wearing only a shirt and underwear.

My parents have gaslit and dismissed my emotions constantly. They verbally insulted, guilt-tripped, and manipulated me. There is a constant dismissal for my autism, trauma and boundaries. And of top of that, a complete lack of apology and accountability.

I am done expecting these people to change. The best course of action at this point is to keep things civil and respectful on the surface but emotionally detach and grey rock. I am done talking to them about my emotions because my boundaries are never respected, not even a little. My lived experience is constantly denied, and everyone is quick to police my behavior while making endless excuses for their own shitty behavior. I am done with that. I am letting of the fantasy that I can somehow hold them accountable. I am letting go of the idea that they will finally change. They never did. They are still the same. But that doesn't mean that I have to stay the same too. I will heal. I will move forward. I will get away. That is goal now. 

And before anyone says it, yes I am 100% going to moving out of my parents apartment. But moving out cost money, and I'm not financially independent yet. I am still a broke ass college student. I don't feel safe taking on rent while finishing school. Right now, I commute to and from school and stay at home to keep costs down. I just want to emotionally survive without losing my mind, dignity, and future. 

What I am trying to figure out is what people in similar situations have done to keep themselves emotionally stable. I want to heal myself and my trauma, but sometimes healing while living in an unsafe environment feels like trying to heal a burn while still stuck in a house full of fire.

1)How do you protect your mental health while living with people who have caused you trauma?

2)What boundaries work when walking away isn't an option?

3)How do you stay focused on your goal while dealing with gaslighting, manipulation and emotional neglect?

4) How did you regulate yourself while living with them? I have a very hard time emotionally regulating myself because I find that my mind ruminates a lot on past conflict. I struggling to let go with how my parents have treated me. I have so much anger towards them that I sometimes have outburst when I am pushed pass my limit. I would like some coping strategies to help with that.

If you were in my situation (or similar), what did you do that helped you survive it while you were still living with them?",Apprehensive_Share93,1759671650.0,6,1.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1nyoik7/how_the_hell_do_yall_regulate_and_heal_while/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1nyoik7/how_the_hell_do_yall_regulate_and_heal_while/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1nyohkn,Moving out advice please,"(21f)   I was considering going homeless/choosing a local shelter service where you live in a quite beaten area ( but I delayed this as i have some agoraphobia and was scared) chosen to go to university again even though i really don’t want to , i wanted to stay at home and learn how to drive and work. 

But university was the only way because i now have a loan im using to live away from them and i am going to try to make s good portfolio and work so when its over ( in two years ) , i get a full time job or use the shelter service and i can leave for good. 

For context its three older sisters and one single mother and they are all literally insane people but you’re average judgemental close minded and appearance obsessed arabs. I am hoping i get my mothers inheritance though she hates me , it is from her home in her home country she is selling. 

As i am in the process of packing ( without a car and only using suitcases and bags and walking to and from the train station with them all watching me on the fucking ring door bell app) 

I also have a ton of quite nice clothes i dont wear anymore but have been trying to sell on vinted and i just think its going to be do embarassing for me to go back and forth to take these clothes, like i just want to leave it there to rot i dont know.  

I just hope everything fits in suitcases and bags i really do. I worry i will have to go back and get moe stuff and they will be there and im worried i wont want to go there again even if i have to for some reason. 

I know on Saturdays the three of them are usually out, but their mother is there and there is a possibility that they are just not out on that particular Saturday. 

I have alot to do right now but i feel frozen because i just genuinely cant believe im leaving and i want to do this right and i feel like its a do once and dont come back situation.

1nyoale,Adulthood is coming.,"I don't know what I'm doing with the title, but you get what you fucking get. 😀
I'm both ranting and requesting advice, I wish you could use multiple tags. :(

It's pretty self explanatory. I'm turning eighteen, the big 1 and 8. In six days if I wanted, I could just- leave. Tell her I'm leaving, take some clothes, and go.
If I had the money I honestly would.


Given that I'm going to be legally responsible for myself in six days I honestly don't know what I'm going to do. Get a job? Of course, expect I'm absolutely terrified of the interview process. I don't know how literally anything works, and I'm about as literate as a fourth grader.

All this thinking has made me realize just how much she'd ruined my life. Taking me out of school, forbidding me from even talking to the neighbors. We've been homeschooling sure, but I've basically been having to teach myself a crash course on the basics because I don't know 

Anything.

😞


Can someone give me some cool videos or just a crash course on how to get a job and shi. I wanna leave as soon as possible and I need money. 🐏

I got up and did 3 push ups before someone who looked around my age saw me and screamed ‘intruder’ before they started yelling at me, telling me to get out. He asked me “what made you think it was ok to enter someone’s home?” to which I responded “to be honest, I wish I had an answer to that question”

I left, yelled at his face and punched the door. I walked around my neighborhood, and it didn’t look like my neighborhood that I know it looks like.

I woke up, taking a minute to take it in and started to feel like I didn’t belong in my own home. I’ve never had this feeling before, it’s weird.

1nynuqa,Is it normal for nparent to claim absolute victimhood?,"Hi,

I'm 25, male and not doing well in life at all. I've been fired from several jobs, failed 2 universities and was at risk of not finishing high school.

I recently confronted nmom about my situation and that I believe some aspects of my upbringing had negative impact on my development. I didn't put 2 and 2 together she is a narcissist, I thought she is just traumatized from her childhood and depressed. Nmom went into 1,5 years lasting fit and accuses me of tyrannizing her and wanting to destroy her. She plays victim in front of everyone. She says she is afraid of me, doesn't recognize me anymore. Promised me I'm not inheriting anything from her. I relied on the inheritance as plan B in case I'm not able to make it in life. I can't be around her for more than 10 minutes without her berating for literally anything. I never had any ill will towards her and only wanted bit of understanding and maybe a ""Sorry, I tried my best"".

After years of research, I found out nmom willfully didn't get me diagnosed with dyslexia, dysgraphia and ADHD despite me showing very clear symptoms. At 15 I also started falling asleep uncontrollably in certain contexts like trying to pay attention in classes. At 17 I tried to get examined for this and nmom sabotaged it by insisting to the neurology doctor that I'm just lazy, I don't care about school and stay up late gaming. The neurologist recommended lifestyle adjustment and nmom was like: See? There's nothing wrong with you, you're just lazy. Recently confirmed this sleepiness is caused by type 1 narcolepsy. She didn't believe me for a second, I'm really not falling asleep on purpose.

  
I could continue about the many other ways she wronged me, but post would get too long...

  
Is it normal for nparent to basically declare war on you when you stop behaving like the obedient puppet, they wanted you to be?

1nynhrk,I posted a list of things my mom did and someone sent me a dm bringing me here,"I put the most severe warning because I’m not such what counts as severe.

I don’t expect anyone to read this and it’s therapeutic enough just for it to be out in the world.

She’s in individual therapy and since she kicked me out has slowly been getting better. Shes incredibly mentally ill so any progress is pretty good but we keep low contact.

Shpuld also mention any name of Owen is my brother



Told me she'd give me out to her friends and work me until my fingers bled. I don't remember the context in this but regardless I wrote about it in my diary and cried wondering if I should talk about it to my lunch monitor but decided against it because of the next reason.


2. I'd joke about running away and she'd make comments about me not having anywhere to go or calling the cops to have me returned to her. Also talk about how terrible foster systems are to scare me because I wouldn't want to stay with my father. Also would guilt me saying my cats would be lonely and I think once said she'd give them away.


3. When talking about what we would do if I got pregnant she told me she'd make me abort it and made it very clear I didn't have a choice. Saying unless I wanted to raise it at my father's house because she ""wasn't raising another kid"".


4. Pinning me down or barricading doors. While I understand I had my outbursts and not all of them resulted in no one getting hurt, I remember one specific time where my mom laid her full body weight on me whilst I was on her bed crying and begging her to get off because I couldn't breathe. She'd ask ""are you calm?"" Or ""are you done?"" Or something along the lines of those (this happened more than once) and because I was still upset I wouldn't reply or would cry louder. Instead of getting off because I was begging through gasps she instead told me she'd stop when I calmed down.


4.2. The barricading was when she'd outstretched her arms and legs out to prevent me from exiting a room. If I tried to go through her legs she'd close them and squeeze me while I cried. She also pushed me if I tried to get out through any other way.


5. Locking me in our basement. I don't remember the circumstances of the argument but I decided I wanted to stay with my father (something she'd say ""fine go ahead and live with your father then"" in a condescending tone almost challenging me) and had packed a small bag. I made my way down to a bus stop before she grabbed me and tried dragging me home. I tried to pull away and she threw me over her shoulder while I screamed stranger danger. She put me in the basement and closed the door (it's broken and I wasn't strong enough to get it back open). When she'd decided I'd been in there long enough she put me in my room and gave me bread and water for supper.


6. Spanking. I understand that spanking is a form of punishment still used. But when you do it, it's mainly supposed to be to shock the kid. Not actually hurt them. Using violence as a way to punish your child is sadistic in my deepest opinion. My mother would spank me in a way that hurt so badly I laid in bed and sobbed thinking ""if a zombie bit me this is how bad it would hurt"" (I'd seen zombie shows and knew how they ripped off flesh, it felt like my skin was being peeled off because of how bad it hurt).


7. Using guilt as their #1 parenting tactic. My mother used guilt as a parenting tactic for so long I no longer feel it as a regular person should. This has affected my relationships and my friendships since I cannot empathise with them properly.


8. The way she spoke to me. ""I guess I'm just a terrible mother then huh?"",  ""Oh yes because I'm always the bad guy"",  ""Yeah let's all blame mom for everything"". Things like that.


9. Mental health. During my first covid shot (I was 12, keep that number in mind) I ended up backing out because of my severe fear of needles. While I was getting patented and scolded on the way home I snapped and yelled ""well why don't you just let covid kill me then"". My mother requested Donnie pull over the car and stepped out with me. We argued back and forth a bit and I, whilst in tears shouted ""Well I'm sorry I want to kill myself"". Now to any parent that seems like a warning sign and something you should comfort your child over. A 12 year old stating they want to end their life is a serious thing. Instead my mother replied with ""Yeah well I want to kill myself to!"". I was 12. I didn't know what to do so I just comforted her. Because I was 12. A child.


9.2. Mental health. During a newfoundland vacation I was having issues with a few boys. I went to my mother to complain to which she replied with ""how are you supposed to babysit when you can't even handle these boys"". So I have another shot. Mind you I was swimming in a lake with these boys and I'm not necessarily a strong swimmer. I went to my mom again to complain once more but ended up sucking it up and going back. Eventually the boys and I worked it out and I was going to grab some food. My mother looked sad so I asked her what was wrong. Out of nowhere she replies with ""This is the year I realize you don't love me"". Hard thing for a maybe 13 year old to hear. Turns out she randomly stopped taking her medication. It ruined me. I still think about that day.


9.3. Mental health. I never felt like I could talk in my therapy meetings. or meetings in general. She'd always take over and try to make herself look good to a person we weren't even there for her to see. My social worker Karen pointed it out when she saw the way I shifted when my parents left the room. I'd get so bored in the meetings I'd just disassociate and agree with whatever my mother said. She'd also constantly go ""Well I always like to say -----"" and it's the most random thing she's never said. She did that one a lot.

9.4. Mental health. When I left to go to my fathers after a disagreement with my mother around Christmastime I took it upon myself to get myself to AIS. I was a tad late but it was fine. My parents got there before me because they had a car. The way my mother spoke to the therapist versus the way she spoke to me always caught me a bit off guard because of how different it was. This particular time she even brought out crocodile tears acting as if she was the one who had just left her home because it felt unsafe. This one I remember well because she wanted to decorate the tree without me. This shattered my heart. We have traditions and everything and she was throwing that away to be petty. She insisted it be done on a Sunday (I was going home Monday afternoon). I asked if it could be done later but she was stubborn about keeping it there. I sobbed about it in the next room until I had to come out and talk to her like she was a toddler and remind her everyone's off on Tuesday which she conveniently forgot. If the therapists weren't there I wouldn't have gotten my way.

9.5. Mental health. ""This hurts me more than it hurts you"" is a phrase I will never be saying to my children. Implying that you are punishing me is hurting you more especially when at times those punishments were psychical is physically insulting.

9.6. Mental health. Ignoring my episodes or chalking it down to ""just use your box"" (I had a box of objects to help keep me safe during meltdowns). The box eventually stopped working and all I wanted was someone to talk to. They couldn't even spare me that. I understand it was late at night but spending half an hour to an hour to insure your kids safety sounds pretty good to me. They only stopped telling me to use the box when I cried to my social worker about it and she told them the box won't always work.

10. Food. She never listened to me when it came to food. I have safe foods and unsafe foods. Foods I'd rather sit and watch paint dry rather than eat. And foods I eat during meltdowns or stressful times. One unsafe food is mushrooms. The texture is disgusting and kills me everytime. To the point I've thrown up at the table because I couldn't take it. One particular memory recalls being at my grandmother's (Donnie's mother) and having mushrooms in my food. I tried to politely explain to my grandmother I can't eat them (she was a hoarder and according to my mother very very very upset about me not wanting to eat the meal, which wasn't true as it was just the mushrooms I couldn't eat. I also don't even know if she was telling the truth because of the amount of lies she told me) my grandmother seemed to understand and didn't seem upset about it at all but my mother forced me to eat some which resulted in me throwing up on my food. It wasn't a lot but if my grandmother wasn't upset before she definitely was now.


11. Threats or threat sounding phrases. When your mother sits you on the counter as a toddler and tells you she's the scarriest thing in the appartment something in you changes. I don't even know how to explain this one without using examples I've already used. But for example telling me foster care and adoption centers and bad and demonizing them so I'd be scared and would want to stay with her. 


12. Rearranging my room. This one isn't as and but I still hated it. My room was my only safe space and everytime something moved if felt less mine and less safe. 


13. Locking me out and telling people I ran away. Pretty self explanatory.


14. Creating an environment where I didn't feel comfortable telling her anything. My father knows everything. Because I tell him everything. I didn't feel like I could tell my mother anything. If I had gotten raped or robbed while drinking or smoking anything I probably wouldn't have told her because I'd be too worried about what she'd do and or say about me smoking or drinking. 

15. Feeling the need to put me down In front of other people. Especially her friends. The notorious last time I hung out with them was terrible. It started with my mother saying she'd never forgive Owen or I for dropping out of French. Which already hurt. It led to an argument and I ended up relapsing. I talked to Donnie in their room and eventually my mother came up. When she found out she didn't apologize but argued with me further. I managed to make it downstairs and went for a walk where Donnie followed me. I ended up losing him as I knew our neighbourhood better. My mother to this day still says she will never forgive us for dropping out of French.

16. French and other quits. When I dropped out of French she was furious. She gave me less allowance, more chores and took away my freedom to pick my extra curricular activities. I was given two. One that she chose and one I chose. She also was infuriated when I left Cadets, band, violin. Basically anything. I was put into things I thought I'd enjoy and when I didn't I wasn't allowed to leave them. If my mother had let me leave cadets when I asked I doubt I'd have any issue with it. But now I have a pure hatred for cadets because my mother forced my to stay. I began forcing myself to be sick to avoid it.


17. It's about her. It's always about her. When it's about me it's about her, when it's about Owen it's about her. I learned not to enjoy the gifts she gave me or the suprises she set up because they'd just be used against me later on ""I do (this) (this) and (this) for you and this is what I get? Am I such a bad mother to deserve this?"" And we'd be at like- the natural muesem of history. Or Alderney. If we seemed slightly displeased it became a show. I don't know how Owen stayed so calm all those times.


18. Telling me things like ""You make it so hard to be your mother"". Also ""Nothing I do is ever enough for you is it?"" While once having an argument with my mother she called me a bitch and a brat. Also saying things like ""Do you know what it's like raising you."" I understand mothering is a difficult task and I could've been more appreciative but it felt like no matter what I did it wasn't enough for her and no matter how thankful I was it could've always been more


19. Teeth. My mental state has never been all that. During this I frequently let myself go when it came to my teeth or overall hygiene just because I'd gotten so depressed. I went on a trip with cadets to a place I didn't believe would have a canteen. It didn't and I was eventually dehydrated and thirsty. I only had 2.00$ and nothing there was worth that. I ended up drinking the water from the sink in the bathroom via cupping my hands. I was venting to my mother about it and said ""I felt like a poor person"". Please take note I was a child and was naive to the troubling experiences the poor really have. I've since educated myself. My mother looked at me and said ""no what makes you look like a poor person is your rotted yellow teeth"". This turned into a 5 minute lecture.

19.2 Teeth. I still hate my smile and my mouth no matter how much progress I make on my teeth. I think I'll forever feel disgusting because of her. The way she spoke of my teeth hurt in such layers. I don't think I'll ever be able to learn to love my smile because of her.

20. Episodes. I just had a sobbing fit on my 17th birthday because I got an email home from my school about having 4 absences and was crying and screaming into a stuffed animal just losing my mind terrified and then snapped back into reality and realized Im only doing this because of my mother because she made me terrified of failing school at all. How fucked up is that. 4 absences and an email home and Im breaking down and losing my mind.



21. When Owen and I were toddlers Owen bit me, when I told on him mom bit his hand till he cried.

1nynewo,Please just leave me alone,"Today is my birthday. To me it’s just a normal day. I don’t like being the center of attention. I didn’t even tell people at work the year I first started at my job. They’ve known every year since though and I got a lot of birthday wishes on Friday. 

I wanna make it clear I do appreciate people texting or saying it to me. It’s just when it’s over the top and clearly the person saying it just wants attention when it really bugs me. I also didn’t sleep well last night so I’m a bit crabby 

Anyway both my nparents get so in your face about it it’s annoying. I’ve posted before about how they talk to me like a toddler. You know how excited they get for their birthdays when you remind them and they just want all the attention on them and want constant acknowledgement even directly after you do so. Yeah that’s what my nparents think I’m like on my birthday which I honestly haven’t celebrated in years. I’m also not that close to either of them, which they seem to forget every year. My nmom texted me picture of a birthday message that I’m not completely certain wasn’t made with ai. That, I don’t mind though it is lazy. I don’t mind people saying happy birthday or texting, it’s just the refusal to talk about anything else or realize you’ve done enough. I’m already LC with both of them. 

A few years ago during the pandemic the family did a drive by honk thing which I had said MULTIPLE TIMES I did not want any part of. My nparents still make fun of me hiding inside and refusing to have any part in it. 

They both think just because it’s my birthday I want to be talked to, or sung at, this early in the morning. Both have already said it. My nmom texted and my ndad popped in to say it. Then they both decide to just barge into my room to inundate me with unwanted attention. My nmom sang happy birthday and did a stupid little jig with the SLOWEST PACE you could possibly imagine. It’s a fast paced song, *how is it taking you this freaking long to sing it!* I was watching a video and blatantly ignoring their desperate cry for attention. As she was doing her dumb dance, was laughing because me ignoring her was hilarious and somehow not obvious I didn’t want to be bothered. She then tripped on my phone cord and ripped it out. Then she blamed it on the dog. Lady I saw you weirdly dancing in that direction, I know full well it wasn’t him. 

They’ve also asked repeatedly if I want to go out for dinner. Despite me saying no many times. I have a lot of food restrictions so eating out is annoying. They know this. I also refuse to eat with them period so there’s also that

They ask me repeatedly if I want anything. If  they (or at least my ndad) weren’t going to try and eventually hold the fact that he bought me something, I wouldn’t care. They try and guess instead. It’s always one of my safe foods. Problem is, I buy them often enough where I don’t run out. I’ve made it know what types of clothing I like and my interests but it’s always one of my safe foods they buy. Then they complain about how much of my stuff is in the pantry. I will say when my nmom does gift me clothing for my bday or Xmas, she does really well so it’s not like she doesn’t know.

1nyle5u,Were you allowed to ask for a drink at someone elses house?,"I was never allowed to ask for a drink, or anything else for that matter. Not even a glass of water. 

Sometimes my mother took us for hours and they would chat and the children were just sort of forgotten about as wel often were playing. But we had to wait until we were offered a drink. Never ask. Asking for anything is rude, and I would be punished, because she hated it when we ""acted like we never got anything"" 

Even her closest friends that we saw multiple times a week for years, and whom we visited often (and they visited us often too), we were not allowed to ask for anything.

Looking back now, it's so strange. 

When my mother passed and we went to live with my grandmother, my grandmother made a point that we should never assume that people can simply afford having extra mouths to feed, which I think is a valuable life lesson, but she never made a big deal out of us asking for a drink. 

Looking back now, I wonder what motive there was behind it. 

Now that I have a child of my own, I have children over often and no parent makes a deal out of their child asking for anything at all. They ask for drinks, icecream, food, candy. No one cares. 

As a child I was always shocked if a child dared to ask for a drink or food, or fruit.

1nyjvxu,Mum was the abuser of men and sons in our family.,"All I ever wanted was a loving family and caring parents.
There were five of us — four boys and one girl — and three different fathers. We were all born into chaos, growing up with a mother who used people like objects. We watched her treat men with contempt, including her own sons.
From a young age, I was parentified — made responsible for her emotions, her problems with men, and her constant need for validation. For years she alienated us from our fathers, filling our heads with her bitterness. Because of that, my siblings and I lost the chance to have real relationships with our dads when we needed them most. The cycle of enablers use say things like you know you mother lives you.
The kind of love that became familiar to me was always the same: charming, manipulative, and abusive. As an adult, I found myself drawn to women who mirrored my mother’s narcissistic traits until I finally woke up. I called out the abuse with familiar female partner and went through hell the save my boys. I called out my mother’s abuse years later and when I did, the whole family turned against me. Even my father won’t speak to me now, too afraid and conditioned by his own trauma to face the truth.
Breaking this cycle is exhausting,  I refuse to keep passing this pain down through generations. I refuse to accept abusive female behaviour anymore. I don't even know what real love is anymore.

1nyjl1a,Have you made hypothetical rules if you ever had kids to ensure there safety from your parents?,"Basically what I’m trying to get out is my parents are narcissistic and mentally ill, like severely. I worry that they would obsess to the point of being dangerous if I have a kid. 

Thought this up a while ago but I’d basically make my kids school never take pictures of my kid, and they’d be excluded from any online post the school makes up until the age of 16. 

I don’t want to effect any college applications, so 16 years old is a good point in time to allow them to choose to be online and have their face out in the public eye. 

Myself I’d basically never post photos online of my kid, and if I do they’d have a emoji face sticker over their faces to ensure their privacy. 

I would do this up until they’re 16 years old, after that I don’t care. But I will explain why even at an early age, it’s basically because my aunt and other family members are complacent in my parent’s behaviors. 

And would directly share the photos to them without my permission, direct family on my side will be bared from watch them too. Especially on my mother’s side.

1nyjfob,"Narc father 'helped' with my app, now I'm €40K in debt - this is the THIRD time he's sabotaged my business. Paying him off to escape?","I (40sF)finally figured out 3 months ago that my parents are covert narcs. I've been in therapy my whole adult life thinking I was the problem. Turns out they were the problem all along.
The pattern I just realized:
This is the third time my narc father has inserted himself into my business/life and sabotaged it. I just didn't see it until now. Looking back, there's a clear pattern of ""helping"" that turns into control and destruction.
The current app situation:
A year ago I started building an app. I coded at least 60% of it myself while working my regular job. My narc father ""helped"" by coding the advanced stuff. But here's the thing - he inserted himself in such a way that I can't do anything in the app without him now. He says ""it's your app"" but acts like the owner in the shadow.
The financial trap:
Soon after, I lost my job because I was completely burnt out from working full-time + building the app. Around that time, my father sold one of his several empty apartments (he owns multiple but never let me live in any, even if I offered to pay rent - which is why I had to take out a loan to buy my own place).
After he sold his apartment, I had to start borrowing money from him to keep the business going and literally buy food.
Fast forward a couple months - I'm working myself to death, going deeper into debt with him, and starting to feel like I'm working for him in a ""family business"" I never agreed to.
The mindfuck:
Every time I tried to clarify what he actually expects - ""Is this a gift? A loan? An investment? What are the terms?"" - he'd give me bullshit answers like:

""Don't worry about the money""
""Good thing we can help you""
Vague non-answers

Never a straight answer. Just more guilt and confusion.
Fast forward more months - I'm still working myself to death, deeply burnt out, and now about €40K in debt to him.
Current situation:
I'm selling family land (€50-55K) and my plan is:

Pay them €37-40K to ""settle"" whatever this debt is
Keep legal ownership of the app (fuck giving him that)
Go super low contact, gradually fading to nothing
Move somewhere they don't know about
Get proper C-PTSD therapy

I only realized they're narcs 3 months ago. My nervous system is completely destroyed - suicidal ideation (I'm safe, I have my dog and girlfriend), can barely work, burnt out in every possible way.
The question:
Is paying €37-40K to escape smart, or am I being manipulated again?
Part of me thinks I should just disappear and pay nothing - the ""debt"" was never clearly defined, he deliberately kept it vague to maintain control. But I'm terrified of them and what they might do.
They're in their 70s. My thinking: pay this, let them think they ""won,"" go low contact while they think everything's normal, and by the time they realize I've actually vanished they'll be too old to chase me.
Also - the app barely makes money and I don't even want it anymore. The whole thing is tainted by his manipulation. I'm taking my database (I collected the data) and building something new without him. I just want OUT.
This is the third time he's done this to me and I only just figured it out. I can't let there be a fourth.

1nyictl,Are my parents narcissists?,"(This is very sloppily written but I’m lowk pissed so Idrc)

My parents are very overprotective and always make me seem like my problems/emotions don’t matter because I’m “not the only one suffering” and my parents also go thru shit. I asked them to go out with some friends today, they said no, was a bummer, but I didn’t dwell on it. Later that night my friends were in the area and asked me to come outside to say wsp, I told my dad I’d be in the front of the house, and I went out, literally down the street, maybe a 5 second walk, and like a minute later my dad comes walking out to get me, he comes up to me and my friends and tells me to get my ass in the house and then starts cussing my friends out. So that shit was embarrassing, and I come inside to my parents yelling at me, saying they can’t trust me to do anything because they “didn’t know where I was at” and I “lied to them” for literally walking not even down the fucking street. Keep in mind I’m a 16 year old junior in high school. My dad starts yelling at me telling me that my actions are ruining his marriage, while my mom says I’m a stupid kid. My dad says that I only care about myself and how “I’m not the only one suffering” because other people in the house have problems and how he can’t have a happy marriage because of me. I go upstairs, and my mom comes to take my phone, and starts cutting off every word I say telling me not to talk back or raise my voice because a child is inferior to the parent. We argue for like an hour, she cries in between saying she always defends me and how she will always love me even if I talk down on her, even though she came in my room yelling at me for standing outside of our house. Then she wants to say that it really wasn’t that big of a deal when we had a whole situation over some small shit. My parents deadass don’t let me do anything, not even letting me go to football games at school, even when some of my friends offer to give me a ride, there is always some excuse, and my mom always likes to say I isolate myself. My parents are always the victim and never are any of her kids.

1nyhkac,Mom went to jail and it's fucking me up,"long story short,i got an nparent like yall.  
At one point i basically went NC/LC for years because all she would call for was for me to do stuff for her. well, after that period of nc/lc i had to move back home and that's when then torture started. I wish iwas exaggerating but this is what it really felt/feels like. I'm talkin sleep deprivation, constant critisms, rage episodes over things that aren't even things(like moving papers 5 inches across a table), threats to make me homeless, gaslighting, deliberately sabotaging me(promising to help only to then decide not to without reason, or, she's make something up so she had a reason to feel justified ) / making things harder for me so its more difficult to get my shit together and move out...lies..all of it. 

Well eventually i was able to get a pfa against my parent and she subsequently violated that pfa so they took her to jail.   
Here's the part that's fucking me up... I'm sad. I'm genuinely worried about her. I don't think she's mentally built to handle it because she's really immature, but also the type that like to appear as if she's never broken a rule in her life(ironically she really does mostly follow rules, speed limits, etc). But i'm really worried about how this is going to affect her. I keep finding myself thinking about what is she loses her job she been at since i was in high school(im in my 30s). Will it make her lose the house we/she's had for the last 30 years? 

I'm worried, and i'm angry at myself for beeing worried because there have been months,YEARS of abuse and not once did anyone bat an eye while i begged her to stop, to listen, try to understand me for once, give me bare minimum basic human respect, or even just leave me alone when i couldn't even hope for the bare minimum respec. But i'm still sad. I know my mother isn't mentally well and regardless of how many times i've told other people that these people dont care about us it's supposed to be my fuckin mom.... and i have no one. no friends. technically i'm realated to people but I don't have relationships withthose mf. it's really just me and two cats with fleas.. i just don't know how to feel or what to do...What's even more fucked up is i specifically remember during one of her ran'ts she said ""I have to have peace even if you don't""  but here I am, finally able to defend myself against her behavior even if only for a little while, and all i can think about is how this might ruin her life....and before i can even process what that means to me i get the revalation that this dynamic, this ""I just want peace, not revenge"" thing of mine is probably why/how people take my kindness for weakness..",IrateContendor,1759648317.0,6,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1nyhkac/mom_went_to_jail_and_its_fucking_me_up/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1nyhkac/mom_went_to_jail_and_its_fucking_me_up/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False

Like bitch, slut, and how I practically ruined her life from the day I got into her womb and etc etc. She'll ask me if I'm satisfied with my marks and this question is honestly a 2 blade sword. If I say yes, she'll insult me and how my standards are too low and how I'll be unable to do anything with my life and end up being a baby making machine. If I say no, she'll ask me why, and no matter what I'll say she'll insult me. You know her taunts and insults get to such extent that I end up harming myself by scratching myself with my nails and punching the walls barehanded and etc and end up wishing that an accident happen to me and so bad that my mother doesn't even get to see my body.
I have one day to manipulate her. How will I do that? I know it's wrong but I can't be more wrong than her right? I'm not trynna hurt by manipulating her. I just want to manipulate her into thinking that these bad marks are not my fault only and she's at fault too cause she constantly creates distrubance in my mind and peace and in the house. She's a narcissist, really. She mentally abuses everyone and then says that she's the one getting mentally harassed.
Bro my mother is sooooooooooooooooooo toxic. If a third person gets involved she'll not correct her behaviour but will blame me for defaming her and worst case scenario, she'll beat me up. Tight slaps, hair pulling and in the worst case, a metal rod or a thick stick or broom. I can't involve anyone else.
Guysss help meeeee 😭😭😭

1nyfisy,Parents hitting me in the face as a child,"I have been reflecting a lot on my childhood recently. My parents, mostly my dad, but on occasion my mom hit me across the face a fair amount as a kid. My dad did it a lot when we were doing my homework together and I did not get things right or could not understand something and other times just when he was mad or I had misbehaved at school. My mom did it when I misbehaved too. I hated it at the time but I do not think I thought deeply into it. Now as an adult I do and I hate that it happened. I think I struggle as well because it is not one of the more extreme forms of abuse where parents have used objects and left marks on their kids etc. which is very obviously abusive. Hitting on the face is still bad but sometimes I wonder if I exaggerate how I feel about it. I would cry a lot when it happened and I think something that adds to how bad it was is how unmoved they were by me crying. I would hate to see any child I did not know upset, let alone my own. The first time I can remember it happening was when I was 6 and I think it stopped around 13 or 14. As an adult their actions have made me have very low confidence, made me feel unloved, lonely and unprotected which is a pretty crap feeling.

Saw her post on Facebook how she just turned 90 and her WHOLE family showed... i was not invited.

1nydoke,i am starting to realize my mom is a covert narcissist. my dad is emotionally immature.,"Hi. I don’t even know where to start.

My parents have been divorced for 15 years now, since I was 22. I feel like since then, I have been left to take care of myself.

I am always the one maintaining the relationship with both of them. My dad lives in florida, but when he comes to new york for work, he doesnt make time for me unless I come see his band play. He will extend his trip to see his mother in law, though. The woman he left my mom for he is still with, and it made me feel like i had to choose my moms side.  He was here for a week and the only way i could have seen him was if i went to see him play with his band. And even then, i greet him and talk to him for all of 5 minutes. The only time i see him and we have “quality time” is when i go out of my way to visit him. My mom, since my parents split, has played the victim card, has used me as a therapist, and will always chose her siblings over me. Her siblings made sure she had a place, which I am grateful for. I was not given the same luxury. We were sharing a room at my aunts at one point, but they made it clear that they wanted me gone and wanted me to pay rent, though I just graduated, was out of the house all day because of work (from 7am-8pm),and would go stay with friends whenever i could. I was there for 5 months and have been on my own since.  I didn’t really have time to process things, because I was just focused on surviving. 


My mom is in a rehab facility and picked one 1.5 hours away. The past few weeks, i have seen how she uses guilt to manipulate me, and will often use triangulation between me and her siblings. She doesnt call me or text me, but tells her siblings that I don’t visit enough, I don’t call enough, i don’t go early enough. Then they come down on me and don’t understand that i work, full time, in office, and don’t drive (i live in NYC) I have to take 3 trains and a cab to get to her (this takes two hours). My partner drives, but she can’t always drive me. My aunt and uncle are retired and drive, but my aunt insisted my mom be close to her. She did not like to drive to see my mom when she was close to me, but expects me to go by public transit. They want me to either stay at my aunts to go see my mom after work. By train, its over an hour to get my mom from work, and my aunts house would be about 1 train and 1 bus (about 1.5 hours). I could get there around 7:30, would have to leave at 9 bc of visiting hours, go to my aunts, get up at 5 and go to work. In my personal opinion, that is a lot of running around for 1.5 hours. I haven’t gone in a few weeks, and she has called me once and texted once. She has, told her siblings, how i havent gone or called, and they have both called saying to go and she misses me.  It really hurts me that she gives me the silent treatment and makes me out to be the villain. It shouldn’t surprise me as her favorite phrase when I was kid was “because I said so.”

I explained that I would not be able to visit as much when it was decided she would go to this facility. It has been ignored and i just get ridiculed for not going. They won’t say it outright, but they do not like it that i dont spend every free moment with my mom. This summer i was going every weekend, was burnt out, depressed, and was told i wasnt doing enough. If i went to the beach, i would be told to go to one close to my mom, so i could see her more. If that really was a concern, then they would have listened to me. I brought her all of her clothes, games, word searches, snacks, laptop. I bring her food every time i go. I havent asked for anything, but all I hear is how I am not doing enough. When my mom was 5 minutes away from, i went every day. When i would leave, she would pout. If i wanted to leave at 9 to get ready for bed, because I get up at 5, she would say “you always get up early.” I ended up getting a fever and really sick the next day. When she was in the hospital, I was there every day after work. There was a period of 5 days where i was there for hours, every day. One day i was there from 9-9. 

It is expected of me to leave my job/take a pay cut and have my partner supplement my expenses, which I do not want to do. My aunt knows how much help my mom needs, but expects me to take it on.  My partner and i live in a one bedroom apartment, so its not like she can stay with me. They have implied that they expect me to stay with her in her studio apartment. My mom and my aunt enable each other, and I’ve seen how they manipulate the rest of my family. I have started to see this as enmeshment, guilt tripping, and silent treatment. We recently got engaged, and i think shes threatened by my partner. Last time i saw her, she forced me into her lap for a hug. I felt so uncomfortable. She also has said multiple times that she would take my engagement ring if i didn’t want it, and where hers was. When we got engaged, I still didnt connect all of the dots, but was sad when both her and my dad seemed to fake their happiness for me. 

Can anyone relate to this? Did you feel this overwhelmed when realizing everything about your parents? I’ve come to these realizations because of therapy, which has been a huge help. 

I apologize for the word vomit. This has all been happening the past month after i started to see how my family acts isn’t normal. My thoughts feel overwhelming.

Thank you for reading and for your time❤️",Carmenmarissa,1759634962.0,4,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1nydoke/i_am_starting_to_realize_my_mom_is_a_covert/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1nydoke/i_am_starting_to_realize_my_mom_is_a_covert/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1nydnh6,Would my dad be considered a narcissist or just Asian?,"Okay, BEFORE ANYONE YELLS ABOUT THE TITLE. I am white, but my dad is Japanese (I'm adopted, long story). He's 68 and I'm 16, and it's just me and him (another long story). I've been noticing this kind of stuff happening at home that other parents (who were not Asian) weren't doing or would even frown upon, but my Asian friends just said ""oh yeah, it's an Asian parent thing."" Here's the thing: some of the things he's done feels beyond that justification and I feel like I'm going crazy trying to rationalize it.

  
1. He used to make me keep the bathroom door open while I was changing until I was 12, and he only stopped when I yelled at him saying I was uncomfortable. He still makes me leave it open if I'm simply using the bathroom, and we will often just walk in and be in the bathroom talking while the other is actively shitting. We do not do this when people are visiting, however: then we shut the door.

2. I have certain sensitivities, especially with food textures and noises. Scratching, guttural noises, mushy food like avocados all make me want to start screaming in fury. (No I don't have a diagnosis for anything, that's gonna be another point later in the post.) When I bring up the fact that I am uncomfortable and annoyed, which happens a LOT, he will keep doing it. I say that him scratching his feet is making me cringe? He does it louder. I say him sticking his feet in my face is annoying me? He'll stick his toes IN MY EAR and say that 'they're clean, what's the big deal?!"" (this just happened right before I typed this lol). It keeps going. I have a fear of tiny bugs - I am a coward - and he'll mimic bugs crawling on my skin or buzzing around me and then laugh as I nearly cry.

3. He puts me down. A lot. The unspoken rule in our house is if my grades are below a 90, it's a disappointment. He gets daily email updates about my grades, screams at me for any single missing assignment, makes comments like one memorable time I got my first 100 in Social Studies and all he said was ""So what? That's how it should always be."" when I was in 8th grade.

4. He never takes accountability. Any time we have an argument, I have to apologize. Even on small things! And he usually goes for strange insults to throw at me. We were arguing over how to hold a pencil the correct way and during the argument he said ""You're just like Trump, you have a huge ego and can't lose!"" (We're a liberal family). He's also compared my ego to my aunt's abusive ex-husband based off little arguments like this. He would also give me the silent treatment if I didn't apologize the way or time he wanted, which memorably resulted in me having a breakdown(?) and bear-hugging him while sobbing because I'm a big physical-touch person and he hadn't shown me any affection or acknowledgement in a week over a missing math assignment. 

5. He refuses to get me tested for anything, or even mental help. For context, I've had two dear family members pass away in my memory (my other dad from pneumonia when I was 7, and my best friend by suicide just this New Year's) and any time I ask my dad to get me even checked out by a doctor, he refuses by saying I'm overreacting and I'm normal. I've also noticed learning difficulties in myself (not to self-diagnose at all!) and when I asked my dad about possibly getting an evaluation just to put any worries at ease, he just laughed and completely ignored me. Fun! :D

Can anyone let me know if I'm finally cracking or if I should be worried for myself? There's more stuff like the fact that I work part-time while in high school (his idea) and that my dad has actively tried to break my relationship with my bio parents and that he forces me to be Buddhist and go to church with him and take care of the small children there and that he will flip from saying that I'm the only reason he's alive to screaming that I should go back to my bio parents (""Oh wait, they don't even want you!"") and a lot more. I'm planning to go to college and getting TF out of my household but then he'll probably talk shit about me to our extended family about how I'm ungrateful lol.

I pleaded with her that I needed it for my health and she blew up at me for, in her own words, “ruining my day”. 
It was quite bizarre today - I don’t hate my mom but our relationship is very complicated.

1nyczwf,"In addition to ‘JADE’, is ‘Correcting’ something to avoid as well?","Had this really uncomfortable text exchange with my brother following going no contact with my parents. 

Despite most advice I told my parents via message (because when I speak in person I’m overwhelmed with trauma responses) why I was not going to accept boundary violations from them going forward. It was my last ditch attempt to make them understand. To my astonishment (but not to anyone’s who understands immature/narcissistic parents) they refused to accept my feelings, and questioned my sanity. I had said I will stop contact temporarily or permanently if they weren’t going to accept simple boundaries, but didn’t really expect to have to do so.

But following the response that they wouldn’t accept it I had no choice but to not engage any more. It’s now been a few months since anything from either of us. Of note is that I decided to keep this private from my brothers and sisters because I didn’t want to badmouth our parents, and I didn’t have the strength to argue if they tried to defend them and asked for more information.

Some of my brothers and sisters have reached out either with direct accusations of causing trouble, or with more subtle tactics I.e. concern. And one of the things I found very helpful was the advice not to JADE (Justify, Argue, Defend, Explain). The hardest thing to do though, in my opinion, was to not *correct*.

I realise this the same as argue or explain, but I’m separating it because I found it so damn hard. Basically one of my brothers made comments about me “cutting off contact with their grandchild” and my whole heart wanted to scream back “1. They chose to stop contact, I told them what simple boundaries I needed to be acknowledged in order for things to work and they refused, and 2. I spoke to them about *me*, they are dealing with me, not my child.”

And the reason I see it as different from argue was because it came from an otherwise gentle and respectful conversation. It felt to me like if someone treads on your foot then immediately apologises but you’re 99% sure they did it on purpose but to call them out would seem bizarre. However, my friend thought this was mad that I wouldn’t see that comment as extremely argumentative regardless of the niceness surrounding it.

Does anyone have a view on these kinds of comments? Like when you’re trying to not discuss something personal and someone is obviously desperate to and says incorrect things in the hopes you’ll correct them?",Marmiteindifferent,1759632757.0,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1nyczwf/in_addition_to_jade_is_correcting_something_to/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1nyczwf/in_addition_to_jade_is_correcting_something_to/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1nyczrr,The grief of being around a partner's family,"I've cut off my entire family, for about 2 years now, although theres really just one main offender (aunt who raised me) and the rest typically would act as flying monkeys or guilt me for my strained relationship with her (as they consider my aunt my ""mother"" after my birth mother, her sister, tragically died in an accident)

It's so difficult to be around a happy family (my fiance's - he has 5 siblings and so many aunts and uncles and cousins). Of course, every family has their difficulties. His isn't perfect either. But to have people to reminisce about decades of history, older adults who look out for you and care for you and cook for you. People who have your best interest in mind.

Then to add also being a stepparent where of course you come last compared to your partner, the bio parent. Not the preferred adult at all. Loved but optional. To go to every school pickup and event and be there every step of the way for a child and still obviously be an outsider, the optional one. Ultimately replaceable.

Loved but at a distance. Welcomed at a partner's family gathering, but also no one would miss you if you werent there. Maybe they wouldn't even notice my absence.

The additional acceptance and inclusion that WOULD come from being the mother of a child in a loving extended family, though not directly related to the rest of the family. But I dont have that - i'm NOT the mother of the child.

The pain follows me everywhere I go.. People say to find your own family. But it will never be the same. I will never have what i long for. And he doesnt want any other children because tbh he didnt even want the one, with his ex. And now i am just along for the ride..

Coming back from visiting fiancé's (very lovely) aunt, uncle, and cousins - and it wrecks me. That his family will come from out of country just to visit and support family members. Yet I grew up so isolated. Lived away from all family members until nearly adulthood. Then, in adulthood, My own family wouldnt drive 20 minutes to see me, when we were still in contact. Forget international travel!!!

It fucking sucks, and nothing makes it better. Nobody in my life understands. Fuck.

1nycwfd,Dysfunctional upper-middle class family (TW: homophobia),"Hi all! I'm pretty new to the sub and all the terms I keep seeing being used here (e.g. ""enmeshment"", ""scapegoating"", etc).

I'll try to sum up my story here, but I am in dire need of advice. I come from an upper-middle-class family from the countryside of Brazil. My dad is a doctor who works a lot, is incredibly violent, and cheats on my mom a lot. He's said things like ""I've picked your brother's entire life and the same thing with your mom's. And I'll do the same to you"". When I was 16, I ran away from home to Canada after exposing one of his cheatings (which led to nothing), but things kind of snowballed from then because I felt that if I majored in what he wanted me to be, became what he wanted me to be, etc, it was a way to ""compensate for being gay"" (and that he would eventually love and accept me). Fast forward 10 years later, I couldn't take doing things I didn't want to anymore, so I came back to Brazil to pursue the career I actually want.

This has been an incredibly turbulent time in my life but I am at uni (again) pursuing a degree I've always wanted. I guess I am writing this because I've just come back from dinner with them and my dad keeps reminding me that he will ""gift me things"" (like an apartment... which is not true, because it will all stay in his name legally) in an attempt to get me to feel guilty/in debt with him.

He's always bullied me for the things I want and put me down. My older brother does the same to me in an attempt to divert his attention towards me so he gets bullied less. My mom keeps trying to put me in a position of a ""friend"" or ""husband replacement"" because of his constant cheating and violent behaviour. When I try to leave this position, she says that I'll kill myself.

I've been trying to gain more independence (also financially), but I feel extremely guilty all the time and that I am incapable of achieving things.

Does anyone have a similar story? What should I do?

1nycw3u,My mom is ruining my life,In 2023 my mom moved us to another state to live with her friend and another random lady for like no reason.

We had the police called on us no electricity and the rent wasn’t paid. After she came back we were homeless for a month and she made me do online school. I thought it was for only until January but i did that whole year online. And now i asked her if she signed me up for a inperson school and she told me i need to wait until next year. I cant wait until next year. This is my junior year it really matters. Its very hard for me to focus when i have to take care of my siblings and fix the house up. She also never listens to me when i tell her that my siblings need to go to the doctor or when i say i need my glasses. She only listens to other women its like im invisible.

1nyco5q,Sick of living with alcoholic dad,"(Long post) 

My dad knows basically nothing other than work, sports betting, and drinking and all three compound into one another.

He bets on college football and NFL games, I doubt he ever has won back more than he’s lost. He’s always angry when watching the games too, whether his team is winning or losing, he’s shouting profanities for hours on end (sometimes for quite literally a whole day) at literally anything, bad plays, players, coaches, refs. He’s loud too and can be heard anywhere in the house and even down the street. 

And as the title says, he drinks too. After his work his idea of “relaxing” is drinking and watching football despite being angry while watching games start to finish. He also calls up and video chats with his friends who sometimes sound like they don’t even wanna be there talking to him because they sound so tired and disinterested while he is drunk, basically gleefully yelling at his phone in a drunken stupor. When he’s very drunk he gets very easy to enrage too. If I, my siblings, or my mom do anything that even irks him slightly, sometimes he’ll fly into a rage and yell at everyone calling everyone lazy and ungrateful threatening to kick everyone out and talking about how hard his life is and that no one should complain about anything except himself.

I remember when I was growing up he used to drink I think one to two beers every other day, though I could be misremembering. And about a year ago he actually quit drinking cold turkey because of a health scare and I think a doctor had advised cutting drinking back? (He has since never really went to a doctor again) I remember it feeling so liberating not having to walk on eggshells and knowing that drunken outbursts weren’t gonna happen anymore. But around December of last year he started to drink again and switched to doing it once a week, though he’d still drink anywhere from 8 to 14 cans. That’s when his drunken outbursts became almost a weekly occurrence. He’d also drink when he’d get into fights with my mom, the last one (four days ago) turned physical as well. He didn’t straight up hit her, but did throw things and grab her by the shirt to scream in her face. He drank almost 20 cans that night I think. Three days later we went to a family gathering and he drank a lot there too and as I am writing this he is drinking again. His alcoholism is getting worse. Maybe I’m evil for saying this, but I have no hope he’ll ever stop. I’m just waiting for if the day comes that health complications arise and it all catches up with him. I know it’s dark to say that but I’m just exhausted and although no one says it to him, my mom, my little sister, my older brother, my grandma, and grandpa all know his drinking and rage has been a perpetual problem.

I think I have undiagnosed PTSD too. Loud sounds remind me of my drunk dad throwing things, hear him raise his voice even for an innocuous reason makes me brace myself, and also the sound of a can cracking open too all make me tense up and makes my heart race. This is one of the reasons why I’m never gonna drink alcohol, I never want to end up like him and make others feel unsafe and scared. I just wish I had a normal dad that has hobbies and tells corny jokes and stuff. I hate alcohol and anything alcohol related and I wish it was never normalized.

1nycc0s,Grief from no contact with entire family,"I went no contact with my entire family 2 months ago. It has been incredibly difficult, I expected grief but there have been no amount of books, podcasts or dr ramani videos that explain how this feels. Some days I am okay, uplifted. Other moments I am completely broken. I’m going through the identity fragmentation thing, being in my 20’s and figuring that out on top of my baseline mental health. I’ve had nightmares about being alone, unprotected, unable to get to them; of some family members dying. It feels so cruel sometimes like what did I do to deserve this. My first baby niece was born this year and I babysat her a lot before I went no contact. I saw her about 7-8 times and sometimes look at our pictures and just break all the way apart. I wanted to be in her life, I wanted her to know I love her and nephews, even my brothers who did nothing to me. I feel very alone, I can’t express to my friends what this is like.

1nybrv6,I can’t believe I ever thought I was the problem.,"Super long! First post on Reddit too. Hi guys. 

Today I told my parents upfront that I was going no contact, after two days of my closest friends pleading with me to recognize that what I experienced wasn’t ever normal and I needed to get away from my parents if I want to survive. This is my story. 

For a quick preface and also to point out some of the genuine good: I am a late 20 something adult. I have finally been able to get my life together within the last year - my early 20’s were spent abusing various substances, and in early summer of 2024, I got sober and have maintained that sobriety. I now have a really cool career that I’m really, really good at, and I lived through an insane health condition that will only affect 1 in 200,000 people - I had the surgery to cure it this year. I do want to make sure to state that I’m really happy these days, outside of my parents, and that I have a network of the best friends I could ever ask for, many that have been here for 15 plus years. They’ve held me (sometimes literally) through this. 

Growing up, I dealt with the pretty textbook hot/cold behavior from my parents. I have siblings, and one was always the golden child. Sometimes it was me, sometimes it wasn’t. The abuse from my parents was only a little physical - withholding food from my siblings and I as children for perceived wrongs (one time my mom forgot to actually cook the frozen food she served and we didn’t get to eat at home for a good chunk of time), not allowing us in our bedrooms randomly, giving us pets and threatening to take them back to the shelter. Occasional physical blows but those were rare-ish. 

When I was 18 I did what many of us do and got into a relationship that was incredibly close to what I experienced with my parents. We stayed together until I was 24 and split. I fell into heavy substance abuse then, anything I could get my hands on. At one point I overdosed. My dad didn’t talk to me for weeks, and my mom told me that she had only seen my dad cry twice ever and that once was because I overdosed. She said it was my fault and that he might always hate me. 

Eventually I moved cities and torpedoed my own life into a shitshow, and I accept every piece of blame there. I was drinking every single day, very heavily, meeting up with people on dating apps and doing drugs and god knows what else. It is quite frankly a miracle that I survived. Living away from my parents and my old support group was both a blessing and a curse. 

In April of 2024, about a year into my new city, on the day of that big eclipse viewable in the southern portion of the US, I started feeling really sick. I thought I had bad food poisoning or, quite honestly, maybe just bad constipation. I knew deep down that I was SICK sick but couldn’t trust it. I waited almost 60 hours after the initial bad feeling to go to the ER. When I got there, it was apparent that I had appendicitis all along, and that by waiting because I couldn’t trust myself I had managed to perforate my appendix…..almost into two pieces. I had emergency surgery, and while sitting in my hospital bed post operation, my mom sat with me. She said “hey, just so you know, we’re going to help you with the copay. But I’m not happy about it. I wanted to go to Europe this summer and the money we would have used to get flights is being spent on you. Don’t do this shit again.” I laughed. I thought it was a joke. It was not. My friends begged me to cut contact. I did not think it was serious at all. 

Fast forward to summer of 2024 - my childhood cat dies, and I make the decision to commit to sobriety. Life is pretty good for awhile. I was stable, reconnecting or making new really amazing friends, and enjoying work. My parents would alternate between praising me for my skills at work - it’s an art job - and being weirdly competitive. My mom does ceramics as a hobby and she seemed proud but also upset that I could make my craft a career and she couldn’t. She always wanted to compare notes on who was doing better. 

Fast forward again to one week ago. A week ago, my neighbor died in one of the most traumatic ways possible, and while I can’t post details to protect my address and safety, let me just say that it was one of the most upsetting situations I will ever see in my life. It involved heavy police presence for the better part of this week too unfortunately, as well as seeing his family devastated. I didn’t know him well, but we spoke every single day. He would sit on his porch and we would chat daily. I was a little scared of him, but he was just a guy, and seeing him die like that shook me to my core. 

I called my dad Tuesday sobbing, after the initial shock wore off. I was devastated. My dad answered the phone and the second he could tell I was crying…. The screaming started. His favorite line is “cut that shit out”, followed by “why do you care”. The care was for my neighbor that had just died. I struggled to make sense of it. 

Wednesday was okay. Thursday was my birthday. I spent the majority of the day with my friends, but my parents insisted I drive a four hour round trip for dinner with them. I live in a bigger city with better food, but they wanted a specific restaurant. It was my birthday but that didn’t matter. Dinner was alright - there were small digs throughout, but I tried to just stay chill. I could tell it was going to blow up soon though. 

Friday morning we met my cousin, who is pregnant, and her toddlers for brunch. My cousin is very protective of those boys right now. My mom kept ignoring my cousin when she asked my mom not to feed them, or not to give them specific items we ordered, or to not encourage them to run around. They kept falling and my cousin just wanted them to sit and chill. My mom got incredibly aggressive when my cousin told her to stop, and when I calmly said that we need to respect my cousin’s boundaries with her sons, my mom was livid. She picked one of the boys up and started swinging him around “to play”, and kept swinging him increasingly close to my face. I started taking big steps backwards and she got more and more aggressive. The child was not having fun and seemed scared, my cousin seemed uncomfortable at best and scared at worst, I was just watching her eyes get black and could see the violence behind them. 

My birthday gift this year was a two day getaway out of the state. I haven’t taken a vacation in three years. My mom texted me when we left the restaurant to cancel saying that it seemed like I was too stressed from my neighbor’s passing. 

I texted back the following: “Hey guys. Please read this when you have a second, and I would also like to ask that you take time for yourself to process it before responding. We don’t need to make anything into a big deal, and we don’t need to be angry or aggressive with each other, especially since it’s your last day with (my sister). 

I’m trying to keep everything happening as low stress and low drama for everyone as possible. I understand that there is some frustration on your end with this, and I am going to send two resources that might help explain what is going on with my brain and body better than I have been. I’m sorry that you are frustrated that I am hurting. Unfortunately, I can’t change the timing. 

I understand the perspective of “you shouldn’t let it bother you/care,” but unfortunately that isn’t the reality of what I am living through, and I am incapable of “getting over it” like that. There’s no magic cure for that - I have been doing therapy this week, and will next week as well, but there’s no quick solution, and there is no overnight magic prescription medication that will take away the anxiety either. This will take time for me to process, both mentally and physically. I’m doing really, really well all things considered. 

What I am working on by myself is the techniques I have learned in therapy, as well as staying active physically and mentally through art. I’ve been using techniques like ice packs on my chest to mitigate panic attacks, going for jogs to work the panic out of my body,
and have a few really fantastic people I am able to call to help when needed. 

What I need from you is just more space and time to process, please. I know you are probably scared deep down that I will backslide to where I was, and I am confident that won’t happen, but I can’t fix the anxiety overnight. It isn’t possible. Please give me more time and space, and if you’re able, please just try to empathize. I am working hard to see where you both are coming from, too. I haven’t had great success in the past opening up to you about what I need, and am trying to approach you how you prefer to be approached. 

I need the trip. If mom decides she doesn’t want to go, I understand and will support her, but I need to get away from my daily life and home for a few days. If mom decides to cancel her portion of it, please let me know. I would still like to go alone. I would love to have her come still. All I am asking is that if I need a minute to breathe, that I am given that minute. I don’t need big reactions, just a minute or two of space. 

Thank you for taking the time to read and process.”

The reaction to the above text was swift, and brutal. My mom responded to say we could still go on the trip, but she then left all group chats I was in with her and others. My sibling was texting me what she was saying about me, and it was stuff that no parent should ever say or think about their child. 

I wanted to sleep on it before making a decision, and spent the night with friends. They held me while I cried, and I thanked them. I told them that I know I’m not easy to love and thanked them for loving me anyway. One grabbed my hand and said she was so sorry that I was ever told that I was hard to love. She said I was not. 

I woke up today and realized that I had to be done. I canceled the trip, and as suspected, the reaction was bad. My mom texted my sibling and I the following message: 
“Sooooooo
What started out as ' fun birthday trips' for both of you has turned into the usual shit show....
Dad & I are awful parents...
You have awful siblings who don't respect you or your 'boundaries'....
I specifically traumatized both of you....
Ok! Great!
I'm an awful mom & person! I traumatized you! I was inappropriate!
You can both live with that memory...heaven knows you both love it & use it as the reading for your mental health trauma.
Im not playing the game anymore.
But god knows
I am done being the cause for everyone's problems....
Maybe I was a good mom, maybe I was a bad mom, probably I was somewhere in the middle.... but I don't need to be the forever
'cause' of unhappiness”

I wanted to respond and tell her that she was right. She was a bad mom. She was abusive. She is the reason that I have panic attacks. She is immature, and she does have awful boundaries. But I didn’t. I just said she needed therapy and left it at that. 

I went to an emergency mental health clinic for most of today, and the social worker let me talk for two hours. He told me many, many times that none of this was normal. That it had never been normal, and that it never would be normal. That a reaction like what she sent to a text as neutral as I had sent is insane, and cruel. That telling me that her Denmark trip was ruined because I needed emergency surgery was unthinkable. And he told me that I was never crazy for being upset about seeing my neighbor die, that I am having a very normal reaction and all things considered…..doing pretty well. Every single member of that facility that heard my story cried with me. Even the old school, no nonsense psychiatrist. That, chat, is when I realized I was cooked. I was never the problem. 

I don’t know where to go from here, other than to go no contact, which is the plan. My friends have been unbelievably incredible through this. I’m starting trauma therapy next week, and am in no danger, but I’m so sad tonight. I know it will be okay, but I was truly, genuinely convinced that I was the problem for my entire life. I thought that maybe I really did intentionally cause the appendicitis and heart problems just to fuck with them. They said so, so it just be true, right? But today I realized it was never true, and I would never treat someone the way they treated me. 

I’m going to keep moving forward. I’ll be okay. But I’m shattered that I believed for so long that the abuse against me was my own fault.

1nyaykt,Is this on me?,"I'll start by saying that my parents have been obsessed with my weight and what I eat my entire life. That being said, back in 2024 they pressured me to take Wegovy, and I finally gave in this February. My mother, a doctor who doesn't specialize in anything weight related, got the prescription and has been administering it to me. For context, I’m not overweight and never have been. I initially weighed 133lbs, and I now weigh 119lbs(I cycle between 115-119lbs weekly). The thing is, I’ve allowed my mother to give me this medication. I sometimes even remind her to give it to me when she forgets and I don't want to get off of it because I don’t want to gain back the weight.

1nya8hs,"19F, Pre-Exam Stress: My Mom is burning my clothes and my parents are demanding double chores, saying I have 'no right' to complain.","
My mother has, on two consecutive days, burned my uniform blouses claiming they were ""ill-fitting"" and too tight. I had never received any complaints about the blouses from teachers or classmates.
When I discovered the first burned blouse, I called my grandmother (my mother’s mother) while I was crying, to tell her how upset I was and to explain that what my mother did was wrong. My grandmother, however, attempted to justify my mother's actions, saying that she ""might have had a good reason"" for doing it.
My parents were furious that I had complained to my grandmother. They said I had no right to be upset and that they would call her to say things to turn her against me.



This all happened at the start of the school year in September in Jamaica. On top of this, my parents are making what I feel are unreasonable demands that I wash the dishes both before and after dinner on weekdays.
They are aware that I am incredibly busy studying for important regional exams in May. My schedule is already packed:
 * I leave home at 6:50 AM to get to school by 7:40 AM.
 * On a good day, I get home around 5:00 PM, but on a bad day, due to traffic or my driver, I may not get home until 6:00 PM.
 * I am the one who washes and irons my own uniform blouses, as well as all my other clothes.
As it is, I already do the following chores on weekends:
 * Wash all my clothes and bedding.
 * Clean the bathroom.
 * Wash all the plates.
 * Attend classes on Saturdays.
I am wondering if I am already doing enough and if my parents are being overly demanding and unfair, given my academic pressure.

1nya07k,Dark sad truth of the nParent...,"All your nParent had to be was loving, caring, warm, and genuinely a good person. That’s all they had to do. But instead, they sabotaged your growth, manipulated you, and controlled you to keep you in their life to feed their ego. Why? Because throughout their entire life, the nParent was abandoned by friends—maybe even family. Why? Well, you already know why. So instead of looking inward and growing, they protected their ego by manipulating their children to prevent them from ever abandoning them.

The golden child? Always trying to prove they’re the “better” sibling.  
The scapegoat? The one who cannot survive without the nParent.

Any friends, opportunities, or anything that could make a child independent? Sabotaged at all costs. Because leaving them means they’re left with the hollowness they’ve been avoiding—the truth that they are not good people, no matter how much they want to be. Being genuinely good requires growth, understanding others, and real empathy—things the nParent can never obtain.

The biggest slap in their face—the deepest pain you can give them—is leaving, going no contact, and forcing them to sit with their hollowness. This only works if all the children are on board; otherwise, the nParent will use the others to stroke their fragile, petty little ego. They don’t raise children—they raise tools.

Sadly, my grandmother died with all her children still orbiting around her, keeping her at the center of their universe. My uncle, the golden child, always gave her money to validate her and stroke her ego, and in return, she stroked his as the “best child.” Little children stuck in adult bodies, with egos so fragile even an ant could break them.",UnableFun8968,1759623762.0,66,0.95,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1nya07k/dark_sad_truth_of_the_nparent/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1nya07k/dark_sad_truth_of_the_nparent/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1ny9ou2,Bumped into my Nmom on the bus. Im afraid shes gonna ask to live with me,"Turns out, things have been going horribly for her since i decided to cut her off. She's crying and telling me how she and my sister got evicted and she lost her job.She's sleeping outside and she's sick. Telling me how much she misses me. Im in fawn mode during this whole interaction and just want it to end. Eventually, I get off the bus and go home. My whole day ruined. My mom has no where to go. I know her. I know she'll pop up at my place. It'll start with her taking a nap in my bed and next thing I know, she lives with me now. 

Ive sacrificed about years of my life being my mom's caretaker.( there's nothing wrong with her. She's just really immature). I put my life on hold for her while she ""got back on her feet.itll only take a couple months."" A couple months turned into 5 years.We lived together before.I paid the bills, bought the food. Everything. I was also her emotional support , surrogate mother, punching bag, and will to live. I have single handedly kept this woman together. But it took SOOOO much out of me.I was sacrificing pieces of my soul just to keep her afloat.I was miserable and suicidal. Malnourished and underweight. I was withering away right in front of her while she pretended not to notice. At some point, it was either I unalive myself or move out. 

So i left. I cut her out of my life. Things aren't perfect, but ive been slowly rebuilding myself. Then boom. Here she comes like a wrecking ball to destroy everything ive built up. On one hand, it would be morally right to let her live with me. Winter is coming, shes sick with cancer, and has no one else to lean on. But on the other, it would put me right back into a physhe ward.Shed undo all of my progress. Shed probably make me suicidal again, and i might not be lucky enough to survive a second time.Her life is not my problem. She's 55. She should be able to survive without me.But CLEARLY SHE CANT.God shes like a toddler. 

Should I do the morally correct thing and let her in or should I let my cancer ridden homeless mother sleep on the streets? God i feel so selfish even asking this question.
 
Edit: Yes, my mother's cancer is real. My sisters and I were there when she was diagnosed. I confirmed with my older sister that they did in fact get evicted. Sister won't tell me where shes living but she says shes ok

1ny94rm,Aunt is getting married and I'll have to see my N mom,"In less than a month my favorite aunt is getting married and my N mom will be at the wedding. We've been NC for 9 months. For the most part, I've been able to dodge her and make some sacrifices (like not attending my brother's bday, etc), but I will inevitably see her there.

We started being NC after she crossed a big boundary for the nth time and I sent her a super angry text and she never replied. So we never actually had a conversation. She tried to reach out months later with a passive aggressive text, but I said I wasn't ready to talk to her. Now I'm not sure if it makes sense to try and have a conversation before the wedding so it's less awkward or if I just say fuck it. I don't think the conversation will be fruitful (as in, it won't fix anything), but I will at least get things out of my chest (if she'll let me, which I'm not sure). To be honest, I'm still not ready to have this conversation and I already worked a lot in therapy and am in a good place. I don't want this to de-stabilize me.

Anyone been in a situation like this? How did you handle it?

I'm mostly worried that seeing her will ruin my night. That I'm gonna be upset or that she'll try to do something to make me upset.

The other thing that has been on my mind is that she has all my savings in a bank account under her name that I don't have access to. I feel like, at this point, I should just consider this money gone, but my partner and I could really use this money and I'm almost positive she won't give it to me.

1ny93lz,I'm so tired of my parents trying to get benefits even if they're literally breaking the law,"They'll be here complaining about section 8 people who have a lot of kids and are on welfare. Yet they'll be here desperately trying to mooch of the government with social security. My mom is trying to make me go on it and encouraging me to lie to get on it. Which... Hell no. I'm going to tell the truth of my conditions and even encourage them to call people who ran the internships, my friends, and my partner to prove that I am capable of working. I've been able to get out of this by lying that I was 'unable to get on it' and using an excuse such as my Acorns account.

Aside from this, my parents were able to get social security for my higher needs brother and mooch off the payments. My mom's even talking about trying to get SNAP benefits with him. Even though they have enough money for food and even though they also mock people who are doing things like getting candy on SNAP.

Now my dad is trying to apply for it and I can overhear my mom constantly telling him he needs to lie and he also cannot say that he does work outside.

I literally wish I could call the cops on them, even though they're just in the application stage. I don't think my dad would be able to get SSI as he gets military pension that is 100k a year. Probably pension from the last place he worked too. Both count as income. But it's like... Why are you trying to go on it? There's literally no benefits for him at all. He has health insurance. He makes more than many people do in the US. They're able to buy food and groceries everyday... It's strange. It's also highly hypocritical. The people who need these benefits need them more than they do. Yet my parents don't like when they're on it. It's only okay if they do it, I guess.

It's driving me insane. Calling the cops would make it worse too because if they're arrested, nobody will be able to take care of my higher needs brother. Because of course they haven't thought much about putting him in a home, they've thought more about their near constant Disney trips, my mom has thought more about her many luxury hand bags, they've thought more about buying a house because they don't like how 'the neighborhood is going downhill' (because white population percentage is going down... I guess).

The only solution is for me to quietly work on moving out but I want to rip my hair out. I wish someone in their life would call them out on their bullshit or call the cops. But it feels like nobody in the family actually cares or knows. I pray that the new future neighbors will. I despise them so much. I just wish they could get a taste of their own medicine somehow. The only time was when my uncle had told dad that the 'reason why my higher needs brother is so aggressive and a 'nightmare to take care of' is because they never worked to get help for him' and then he took it back.

1ny8nmt,My First Monster,"My nmom has always reminded me of the Chamberlain from The Dark Crystal. The skulking, the abhorrent noises. She would always mock others in this odd noise for absolutely no reason. My partner would grimace when she opened the door and, while I greeted him, she’d cut in:
""Oh, did you hear OP? DurrMEHMEHMEH.""
Like I’d spoken with shit in my mouth when I had just said hi.

Ironically, she’s become that caricature more and more with age. Her skin, her walk, her whimpering presence wrapped in a “charming, confident” shell. She’s even trying to wedge herself into my custody case, completely irrelevant, pestering the court until the whole performance unravels. I’ve been waiting my ENTIRE LIFE to see her lose the plot.

And here’s the twisted part: she shoved horror down my throat as a child. Serial killers, gore, murder stories—way too early. She had zero clue I had a brain because I was “her kid.” No filter. No sense of boundaries. I was just some accessory, a purse. What do I know? Why would a scarf be too young to know her boyfriend liked to wear wigs in bed? Ludicrous.

But the irony cuts deeper: the same woman who gleefully handed me nightmares was terrified of her own. Any “floating paranormal” scene, jerky movement, spiders—she’d scream or run from the room. Mention Baron Vladimir Harkonnen from Dune and she’d physically squirm. Heavy benzos turned her into Homer Simpson, screaming in her sleep.

Then came the “funny stories” she loved to tell. The time she took Alprazolam, slept the entire day, and woke up to find every chair in the kitchen pulled out because infant-me had dragged them to climb for food. Hilarious, right? Or the brag: “Oh, you slept through the night super early so I went out with friends!” Really? In the 80s? No monitors, no cell phones. How did you know? I could use a beeper at two weeks?

She harmed me just like a serial killer would—for pleasure, she mutilated me. Mentally. Emotionally. In ways that disabled my life.

And that’s why I fantasize about changing my name. She named me her junior and claimed it was “an Italian thing.” No. That’s not Italian. That’s a narcissistic asshole thing.

The name I want? Harkonnen.
1. Because it’s a basic, common Finnish surname.
2. Because she will know.
3. Because SHE will know.

1ny8nco,"Don't ever had kids, man","Did anyone else's dad say this to their childless friends/relatives in front of you? It could be something as simple as coming up from playing and asking for a juice or water while he was talking to them. His friends, my relatives, it didn't matter. He said it in front of me what felt like hundreds of times. I couldn't imagine thinking about saying that to someone, much less actively vocalize it in front of my child. I'm now in the same profession as my dad, thanks to my awesome father in law. We don't speak much anymore. They have told my wife, kids, and I to come to their house multiple times, but they refuse to make an effort to check on their grandkids or stop by to visit them. They are both 7-10 minutes away from our house 5 days a week and have been here 2 times since my son was born. There are many terrible psychological aspects of my childhood, but this is one that I think about frequently. Has this happened to anyone else? Did it tank your self worth before you even hit puberty? I'm doing good now. I have a beautiful wife and two wonderful kiddos that I could never imagine putting through that type of mental turmoil that I was put through.  

TLDR; My dad used to tell all the single men that he knew to never have kids right in front of me. Anyone else?

Edit: The point that I meant to make when I mentioned that I am in the same profession as him was that a lot of my customers that I love and that seem to respect me now, have listened to my dad talk so much shit about me over the years over various things that were nobody's business and some of them have mentioned it to me.",philosophers-beard30,1759619921.0,15,0.94,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1ny8nco/dont_ever_had_kids_man/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1ny8nco/dont_ever_had_kids_man/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False

""Like you know others are acting like that much sooner and you are only getting in that developmental stage now.""  

Was a part of what she said to me in all seriousness, as if this is the **only** possibly explanation, for not taking constant criticism.
Another attempt at gaslighting me, in order for me to question my experience and emotions in relation to her words and actions (a daily occurrence with her).  
For context i was already half moved out to a different city and studying, while being less and less financially dependent on her, as such i was finally opposing and not taking all her off-hand comments about my appearance, ""misdeeds"", way of being, beliefs and everything else about me that offended her anymore.  
When i gradually moved out i was exhilarated, my perspective being totally reframed as a result of not feeling confined to the toxic and authoritarian family/social hierarchy anymore.  
Felt great being free in the beginning, like a rush and was having the time of my life, meeting many new people, socializing, overdue learning about life and finding out what was really ""normal"" outside.  
Though i still suffer from some low self-esteem and other maladaptive patterns that are harder to change, like the tendency to isolate myself.

1ny848i,Inappropriate Family Members,"I have realized that I may have been raised by a mother with narcissistic traits. When I was a kid, I can remember her admiring herself in the mirror and saying things like: “Not bad for a mother of three, heh?” etc.  Or she would tell me about how many of her teachers were impressed by how pretty she was. Once during a conversation with me she remarked (indignantly):  “Let’s face facts, I was VERY pretty!”  I was stunned. I honestly never ever had the slightest impression that she was anyone I would call “pretty”.  To me, she was and is very average looking, and has always been like that. I used to wonder what on earth ever made her so vain. She has also told me that she had a dream that my husband was making a pass at her, and every now and again, she will report about how some random person will come on to her, or give her some kind of sleazy “How YOU doin’?” smile.  The thing is, she seems to be the only person I know who holds her physical appearance in such high regard. As far as I know, while we have never discussed this, I get the impression that my other siblings are probably more than likely in agreement with me regarding our mother’s appearance.  In conversation with her, when she says these things, it makes me very uncomfortable as I not only completely disagree with her, but I equally don’t want to hurt her feelings, and I’m frequently at a loss as to how to respond. Anyone have any suggestions as to how I could handle this in a graceful and constructive manner? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. One time I tried to shift the conversation to the thought that it’s difficult to quantify “beauty” because it is a subjective concept, but she either didn’t want to hear my perspective, or was simply too obtuse to be bothered by it. Thank you, for any and all responses….",Normal-College4403,1759618510.0,4,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1ny848i/inappropriate_family_members/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1ny848i/inappropriate_family_members/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1ny81o0,Just need to get this off my chest..,"I (24F) live and have a narcissistic father (51M, I think?). I made this account today just so I can get this off my chest. Comments are welcomed, but bashing isn’t. This man is the literal textbook definition of a narcissist. Let’s start off with the fact that he’s a very shitty father and husband. He has all the signs or symptoms of a narcissist: An ABSOLUTELY INFLATED ego. He has a Lack of remorse. Very entitled, not only him but some of my family members too. He has a constant need for attention..it’s awfully annoying living with someone who constantly craves attention, finds ways to get it (bonus points if upsets me and my mom and we shut down on him) and when we don’t give him what he seeks, he gets upset. If nobody is paying you attention, that means nobody cares. He hates hearing the truth about himself.  He’s very manipulative and likes to play mind games, gaslight, (emphasis on gaslight),and guilt trip you and I’m telling you now, that doesn’t work on me because I see through his bullshit. I swear he puts him self on a pedestal when really he’s an awful person and spiteful. He has a HUGE HUGE problem with taking responsibility for his actions and how he hurts us or others. He doesn’t know nothing about loyalty or faithfulness or being who he really is. It’s a Mask he really needs to drop…He often plays victim a lot as if we do him wrong. The rules also  don’t apply to him either. So what he claims we can’t do, clearly he can. His apologies are absolutely meaningless and he hardly ever apologizes for anything he does. He’s very moody and personally in my opinion he acts like a woman …and by that I mean he talks shit about people behind their back (for example my mom, me, certain coworkers) and again, he’s moody. It’s a major turn off. 

We never know what to expect from him on a daily basis. We never know what mood he’s gonna wake up in or who he decides he wants to be when the sun is up. It’s a lot to handle and when he doesn’t get his way he acts like an adult sized toddler. Imagine acting your shoe size but not your actual age. I only get peace when he’s out the house or I have the house to myself or when I go out someplace. When he gets upset, it goes from him being mad or full of rage. He’s mentally, emotionally, and verbally abusive. Him and my mom argue a lot because he can Just not be honest with her about what he’s doing. And me and him argue a lot because I’m not gonna let him run over me. He refuses to acknowledge that him and some members in our family aren’t fond with her or even me. My grandmother (her mother in law) is not fond with her at all even though my mom has been an outstanding partner to him for years on end despite him Constantly dragging her and talking shit about her to people and his mom. He clearly has no respect for his own wife and me, his daughter. His mom clearly doesn’t care how he treats us as long as he’s giving her what she wants. I’m convinced he hates us.

As my parents only daughter and only child in general, I have absolutely no respect for him and no love. I don’t like him. Matter fact he makes me sick and I’m disgusted and disappointed by his behavior, but also not surprised. Being around him annoys me. Being in the same house with him annoys me. When I’m in the house, I stay upstairs in my room. When we do get along, it never lasts long. There’s strings attached and he has a “you owe me” attitude. He’s not humble at all in my opinion, which goes back to his inflated sense of ego. For someone who claims he didn’t have much growing up and now has more than enough, he acts very arrogant or what I’d like to call “uppity”. He looks down on me and my mom as if he’s a king, he thinks he’s untouchable or that he’s god, but swears he’s not better than anybody else. I know for a fact I’m not the daughter he wanted. He probably expected me to be in college by now and graduated with my own Degree and my own place. A few achievements under my belt. A daughter he can brag about to everyone. But the truth is I’m so far behind and I know at some point I have to stop blaming him for why I’m behind in life, but if my mom picked a better man I think my life would be different…I would be more ahead. but now I feel like I’m paying for her sins. Sins or mistakes that aren’t even mine and it’s honestly depressing. I actually think I’m depressed. I can sense it actually but sadly I have to keep moving.

He lacks empathy and if he is trying to be empathetic, he’s faking it. He has everyone fooled that he’s such a great father and husband and that he loves his family, but the truth is he’s a dark cloud and we dread everyday he comes home from work. Sometimes we wish he would just get up and not return. Not saying we want anything bad to happen to him, but just for him to come to the realization that he Doesn’t wanna be here or than we aren’t his cup of tea and just go but that’s impossible because he pays all the bills + mortgage. So if anybody has to leave, it’s us.

When i leave, I plan on cutting contact. Most likely I will change my number or block him. Either way he won’t get in contact with me. I don’t grieve the father I should’ve had. I don’t think I ever have grieved, And I don’t need to. I can imagine when I cut him out my life, I’ll have some peace. Of course when I cut him off, he will be enraged but I don’t care. I don’t feel safe around him and he makes me and my mom anxious. I’m very convinced that he’s Capable of ruining your life if you let him and I think that’s what he did to me and my mom. My mom didn’t have all these health problems until after she got with him. All in all he sucks life out of you and I’m sick of it.

Other things he does as a narcissist who doesn’t know he’s a narcissist is that he has a frequent tendency to lie, doesn’t like being criticized but judges others (doesn’t make sense but ok), he’s vain, very opinionated, VERY CONTROLLING, he’s very nosy, sometimes has an “I don’t care attitude” or can be very dismissive, VERY SELF CENTERED, his moods are inconsistent so when I say we never know what expect from him, I’m not joking. He lacks boundaries/privacy and can’t take no for an answer. He’s an evil and nasty human being and I can’t wait to get away from him because I know for a fact that I don’t wanna be like him, I strive not to be like him…and this proves it.",IllPin9964,1759618314.0,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1ny81o0/just_need_to_get_this_off_my_chest/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1ny81o0/just_need_to_get_this_off_my_chest/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False

1ny7xnd,Need advice,"We are two. Him, the oldest, I, the youngest, but he was always the golden child, mommy dearest and I the afterthought. So much so,that my birthday gifts were general, his were tailored. Christmas gifts were double of what he wanted and so on... I was never allowed to explore my personality because, now I think, innerly I knew I wasn't safe.

To make it short... I searched for approval, a lot, and somehow believe him and my father, a f-ing enabler that thinks of himself as an intellectual martyr, trapped in a mess he made create, truly loved me and wanted the best for me when the effort was zero. Everything got worse when my brother met his former best friend, but it was already bad when he was just starting uni.

He began drinking a lot, fucking a lot too (don't want to hurt anybody, but it seems like a normal trait in the rainbow subjects), and pushing me away, actually abandoning me, not doing something else with me, like an activity together, a hobby we could share to strengthen our bond. He always stalled, preferring the company of others over mine. I thought it was because I reminded him of the abusive house environment, but now I >!fucking!< realize he wasn't neglecting me. He was drowning himself in stimuli not to solve his own>! shit.!<

Needless to say. Some years ago we made a trip to a continent I won't name, to visit some relatives, and the fucker, since we were just the two of us and we were sightseeing alone, since 9 am, it was 4 pm. I told him I was tired and that we should go back, because in a strange city we should stick together. He told me to go back by myself since he was going to meet with some ""friends"" (friends=people he had >!fucked!< with but now pretended to be friends). I decided to stick to him. The worst happened, we got lost, had to call our relatives by a stranger's phone number... It didn't end up well for him. My male relative scolded him, a 20 year old (ha), for being irresponsible and for forsaking my health and wellbeing over his selfishness.

Anyways, guys... If you know, you know... There are millions of intances that happen before everything breaks. This year, starting the year he pulled a move of my mother's and made me feel emotionally unsafe while we were watching my favorite serie's season finales. He became agressive and then blamed ME for becoming aggressive. I decided to detach, since I didn't feel safe anymore and he had proven last year, with the worsening of my chronic condition, that he doesn't care about me, and rather prefers to put his ego first than my health.

We detached, I confronted him WHEN HE ASKED ME WHY I HAD DETACHED, telling him he had to change, quit drinking and go to therapy. He seemed touched back then, and apologized, but only when it suited him (he loves apologizing and never taking accountability). We had months with a strained relationship. He never spoke to me once, never reached out for me even wen I had to go to a fucking motel to get some sleep after my parents' abuse. Rather, he would see me with hate and even push me with his shoulder when we passed in the same hall.

**All reaches culmination three weeks ago**. My grandfather (the only person to ever love me without conditions, and an actual man and not the jokes I live with) died. I went to the funeral, I visited my grandma and stayed with her that day, and he hasn't even been able to text her just once. He doesn't look affected. Damn, I don't think he has cried. But I have. I've showned humanity while he has chosen to show exactly how my mother would act if she wasn't tied to my grandmother's approval, devoid of any feeling and careless.

Everything went to >!shit!< last Thursday. He had been passive aggresive for days, and I was over it. I searched for some stairs since our microwave is over the fridge, and maybe I hit him since when I passed beside him to fetch water. I DID THAT UNINTENTIONALLY, and he gave me the most horrible side eye. I asked him ""Are you angry?"" and he exploded...

He accused me of being an hypocrite, a whore, a copy of our NMom, saying I had abandoned him, even since our trip many years ago. That I mistreated him, abused him, that I didn't see his progress of being sober for 5 months (he said 5 months, then 54 days, and then kept chaging the date until he admited he had been drinking because he was sad)... He would get closer to me menacingly, shouting at my face like he had rabies.. I asked him ""Are you going to hit me?"", and he asked me ""Do you want me to hit you?"". I immediatly called my father, afraid of my brother's volatility but, as a final token of his indiference and self centeredness, he said he had failed in protecting us from our mother and from each other (he had never done such a thing and thinks of himself as a passive bystander) The best (worst) thing is that he walked out the house, **LEAVING ME WITH MY RABID BROTHER**. My brother gets closer to me one last time to say ""we are all victims here, and even while you are an ungrateful >!fuck!<, I'll defend you against our mother. Get that in that stupid head of yours"", or something like that. I have a condition in my head, and he said that last bit mockingly.

I could only tell him he is completing his mother's legacy by trying to make my life miserable. And another thing I don't remember...

I've been in overdrive for three days. Now is Saturday and I fear for my life. I'm his new punching bag and he is way more dangerous than my mother. He is a M27 year old man (a useless one since he can't be hygenic for a shit. He even said it was my job to clean his bathroom, the least I could do since he contributes so much to the house. - we share bathrooms-, but a threat). I'm F26, and I'm scared. I've been moving to try to get out, since I have some savings, but the situation of my country is unstable, and I don't know if I can replenish those savings soon enough... I don't know what to do. Staying or leaving. Reason and survival says I must leave, and figure the savings later... I have to record myself each time I go to common grounds (dining room, mostly kitchen). Guys, please, what would you do?

My brother has always made his public persona as the bullying victim (he was bullied in highschool, but I even doubt that now of him), and the martyr in this household, since his role (so he thinks still, even when I have years telling him it isn't) is to defend me from our NMom... Last time he spoke to me like a semi-normal human, he said ""WE WERE BOTH RAISED TO BE DEPENDENT"". Boy, I was baffled. His reality is so altered he projects everything to me. He claims sobriety, he claims not to be our mother, and yet he took over her mantle and is >!fucking!< terrorizing me now. He had always been coddled. I've always had to fend by myself. Now that he has to face the consequence of his actions, he goes full on war. 

Good thing is, my therapist knows, my immediate circle of trust knows... I'm just unsure if to make that big spend... And well, other things about the payment since things in a certain caribbean country aren't so easy. And I also am equipped if this thing escalates to court.

Thanks for reading me. I know it was lengthy. I would love to read your insights.

(Ps: I returned some belongings of him I had in my room - I didn't steal and the only thigns I have taken out of his room are ones he grabbed, that are mine, without consent), I returned the props he had given me (what he calls gifts)... I left them in the dining room, but he chose to barge in my room to return a couch of mine he had in his bedroom with a 3 page essay about why I'm the legacy of my mother and WHY HE WAS ENTITLED TO HAVE ACTED HOW HE DID TWO DAYS AGO. **That's what terrifies me.)**

1ny7uuj,I (21M) finally realised my mum is the root of my unhappiness.,"I’m 21 and today I’ve realised something that’s been building for years, I don’t want my mum or stepdad in my life long term.

Since I was 16, I’ve wanted to move out. Not because I hated them, but because home never felt free. My mum has never allowed me to go out and see friends. She’d even laugh when she saw I was upset about not being allowed to go. It’s like she enjoyed keeping me trapped.

She has never brought happiness into my life if I’m being honest. She tells me things like, “you’ll never find a better mother than me,” but deep down I know that’s far from the truth. I actually wish she wasn’t my mother.

She hates to see me grow or do well because she’s accomplished nothing in her own life, and she takes that out on me. Today was the final straw. I went out to meet my friends, first time going out at night, and when I came home at 11pm, she started cussing me out, saying, “you think you’re a big boy now because you’re going out with your friends.”

I didn’t do anything wrong. I just wanted to live a little. But it hit me that this is exactly why I’ve been so unhappy all these years, I’ve grown up in an environment that doesn’t let me breathe or feel like an adult.

I’m done feeling guilty for wanting my own life. I’m not angry anymore, just ready to move out and find peace. One thing I know for sure, when I have kids, I will not have her around them. Even if they were to see her, it won’t be for a long time.",LocalBee343,1759617802.0,3,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1ny7uuj/i_21m_finally_realised_my_mum_is_the_root_of_my/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1ny7uuj/i_21m_finally_realised_my_mum_is_the_root_of_my/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1ny791l,How do I deal with emotional numbness and emotional anxiety when it comes to love?,"I’m 23 (F). I’ve never had a boyfriend before or ever truly felt romantic attraction toward anyone. Back in high school, I had two crushes: one because I thought he was handsome (we never even talked), and the other was a close friend — but later I realized I didn’t actually like him; I just felt deep gratitude toward him.

Earlier this year, I met someone through an app and went on a first date. From the beginning, I knew it wasn’t going to lead to anything serious — maybe just a few dates — because of several external factors, like the fact that I was on an exchange program and would have to return to my country soon.

I didn’t even like him that much. I never thought, “Oh God, I think I like him.” Yet, I became extremely anxious. I kept checking his “last seen” on WhatsApp, wondering why he hadn’t replied, looking at the people he followed on Instagram, checking the last time he was online on the dating app, and even watching his friends’ stories with a fake account to see what he was doing (which is honestly so embarrassing to admit).

I became emotionally sick — living in constant anxiety. I didn’t even like him, but I wanted to be the one he liked the most.

I guess I wanted to feel special to someone, to have someone who would never leave me. I was projecting my traumas onto him.

My father, who is emotionally distant, cheated on my narcissistic stepmother with my mother — and that’s how I was born. My mother was an alcoholic and tried to kill me with a gun when I was four. 

Later, I went to live with my father and stepmother, and life was kind of hell. I still live with them.

I feel like my emotions related to love are numbed — asleep, unreachable. I can’t seem to build that kind of emotional connection with anyone, and the first time I tried, I uncovered a pile of pain and trauma I thought I had healed from long ago.

What I want to know is: how do you build connections with people after living with constant emotional anxiety, fear of abandonment, and all the consequences of being raised by narcissistic parents?

(By the way, I never told or let the other guy know about any of that. At least I knew from the start that it was a problem on my part and that I was kind of being the toxic one, so I didn’t put any of the blame on him for it.)",Horror-Rooster4916,1759616238.0,4,0.84,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1ny791l/how_do_i_deal_with_emotional_numbness_and/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1ny791l/how_do_i_deal_with_emotional_numbness_and/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1ny77va,"If you need proof, here it is","I finally confronted my parent, not the normal way of telling them how I felt or whatever. No, after she tried to love bomb me after having an angry text message outburst k sent her this: 

Love is not envious or boastful or arrogant or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice in wrongdoing, but rejoices in the truth.

Now, I’m sure some of you are familiar with this. It’s in the Bible, and it’s really been helping me heal from the pain she has caused me . 

Instead of maybe stopping to think about it, instead of actually giving a fuck about me she just said “yes I agree” and then proceeded to send me some bible thing too. 

Now idk I didn’t look at the message I’m assuming it was obey thy father and mother or something which I would’ve gladly replied with “don’t provoke your child to anger” but anyway. I made my point, I’ve done all I can I’m not talking to her at all anymore. She could show up at my front door for all I care.

1ny6u71,how do people genuinely find happiness watching kids?,"

I cant look at kids without thinking about my childhood. I was with some people and seeing the way they parented their children made me realise thats how parenting should be and how i had just lost my childhood and I always kept on thinking about me. Showing the kids the photo album from 3 decades back I stupidly kept pointing out to myself when the parent was trying to show their pics to their child. I am genuinely broken form inside isnt it?

then I realised people have moved on and I am still stuck in my growing up age. I mean I dont have children of my own but i wont ever look at them and see the broken parts in me.


Edit: actually i felt if they would have given a rats ass as an elder sibling to me when I was growing up I would not have been damaged . And seeing them loving unconditionally his own child (same gender as me) raises a lot of questions within me",ImaginationAny2254,1759615207.0,5,0.86,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1ny6u71/how_do_people_genuinely_find_happiness_watching/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1ny6u71/how_do_people_genuinely_find_happiness_watching/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1ny6mpx,I was begging for help and she stared at me like I wasn’t human,"19m here - I’m autistic and have mental health issues if that gives some context.

Thursday night, around 8pm, I was laying in bed because my head was really hurting on the left side. I had just turned the lights off and rolled over onto my phone to check something- when all of a sudden the arm I WASNT lying on suddenly got pins and needles. It began in the hand, and started moving its way up.

For some context I’ve been having weird ocular migraines for the last year or so. I’ve had to go to the hospital because of the weird way they present:
- Sudden growing blindness in left eye
- No clear/obvious headache 
- Disappears after 10 minutes.
Not here for a diagnosis, just sole context here. They are weird and frightening and I’ve had to go to an eye doctor twice to make sure I’m not having a stroke or they aren’t serious. I’m mentioning this because I was already on high-alert with health.

Anyway, so the numbness and tingling began to spread and I began to panic. I sat up and then suddenly the numbness and tingling was on my face, and then in my mouth.

I ran down stairs panicking trying to frantically say to my mother and stepdad that I needed help, now, and something serious was happening.

They stared at me like I was an alien. I’m not close with family and my mother especially can be cruel and mean about my anxiety issues and dismissive - but this was serious and I needed her to listen.

I continued begging for help - the numbness was now on my tongue and they just looked at me like I was speaking a different language. I looked at my stepdad and begged him and he just looked to my mother.

My mother then picked up the phone and rang 999, and asked for an ambulance. She said she ‘couldn’t deal’ with ‘my frantic and panicked behaviour’.

Anyway, it was a bad night. Paramedics sat with me in my house while I was shaking uncontrollably. Before they arrived I had an EpiPen jabbed into me as they thought it could be an allergic reaction (we have one in the house just in case, despite no one actually having an allergy). 

I was shaking and couldn’t talk or remember basic things. They said my obs were normal. 

I’ve had panic attacks a million times - I suffered with panic disorder badly starting in 2020 and it was hell on earth. I was having a panic attack, but tried explaining to the paramedics that the initial symptoms were not panic. I DO get numbness and tingling in a panic attack - but this was on one side only and spread. They listened and understood. My mother was now acting all social with them - a complete contrast to earlier.

I didn’t end up going to hospital - as they had deduced it was a new type of migraine for me and that it had spiralled into a panic attack (plus the EpiPen). I had an awful sleep - I needed to throw up but was too tired to so just sat in the nausea. 

It’s been 2 days, and I feel like something is wrong with me mentally or this whole thing has affected me more than I thought. I feel like I’m on the edge of a panic attack constantly, and keep zoning out. It’s not a usual zone-out- it’s a deep, empty focus that enthralls me for ages. I feel irritable, I feel dread, and I cannot stop thinking about that night.

I was begging for help and they looked at me like they didn’t know who I was. I know I was speaking clearly - I asked for help and explained but my mother looked at me like I was an alien. I remember the symptoms getting worse and I was trying to explain and no one did anything.

I’ve suffered mentally all my life - but these symptoms feel new. I just feel a deep sense of shame, terror, and just fear over what happened. The night is a weird blur and I barely remember it- I remember shaking a lot and feeling like I had died. 

What is happening to me?

1ny5354,How do you deal with someone that’s a walking contradiction?,"
I’m 32 and live with my 75 year old dad, we share an income and I help be there for him. But that’s basically all I do. 

I said last night was the first night I slept under the covers in my bed since it was cold. He Said he wish I would’ve told him first so he could wash them. I felt bad and I apologized. That made him furious. He always says it’s annoying when I apologized and says I didn’t know he didn’t say he was gonna wash them so why apologize. He called me condescending. 

Yet he also gets mad at me when I don’t own up to my mistakes. So I immediately apologized but he said why, I did nothing wrong 

Then he screamed at me for like 15 minutes and blamed me for the pulsing headache that caused him and his hearing going out and his eyesight getting blurry and was angry the breakfast he spent an hour making was cold…as he spent all that time yelling at me because I felt bad I maybe forced him to do a day long bedspread Wash when if I told him I was going under the covers that’d prevent this 


1–I had to tell him I’m going under the covers…as I’m a grown adult. He won’t even let me wash the dishes since I “can’t do it right” yet gets angry at me that I’m 32 and he does the dishes. I have to ask for everything first. And if I like get my own shirt from the closet, he gets angry. Because I wrinkle them or something. 


2—We argue and I always try to get the last word or say I’m innocent (lately as he’s gotten older he gets mad at stuff that simply didn’t happen) so he says how come I never admit to doing anythig wrong and I *never* own up to doing anything wrong. 

 So today I realized I shouldn’t have said I’m sorry for getting under the covers and he got mad at me because how dare you say you’re sorry and own up to it when I did nothing wrong, as he sighed and rolled his eyes I got under the covrers without telling him because now he has to do a major wash. Isn’t that criticizing me? Although he said I’m good I didn’t know better, was that *so* horrible to apologize? 

I’m expected to be grown but always denies me opportunities 

Got mad I apologized as he criticized me (claims everything is not a critique so I must ask before doing ANYTHING at 32…and then he says how I’m so immature I don’t do anything. Yet when I do…he gets mad. 


I agreed he should be upset and THAT got him mad too. Because why am I agreeing…yet in our arguments he gets mad I never agree and own up to my mistakes 

Lovely 

I’m planning on moving out and will as soon as possible. Shelters here are full of abuse or otherwise I’d be homeless so I can’t move out immediately so please don’t suggest that. I’m in the process but need help in the meantime. 

How do I deal with this?

1ny4rkt,Dealing with Lack of Insight with Family Members I Have Gone No Contact With,"Hello, In the past this board has been helpful with me gaining insight into my situation with my family. I am looking for any insight or suggestions you may have as I am not thinking clearly.  

***Context***

Three years ago I went no contact with my parent and siblings after Thanksgiving (Canadian Thanksgiving) became a colossal mess (made plans a head of time, someone got spooked because I just got over being sick, changed plans (again!) and expected to alter them after wasting resources and time). At the time I was beyond frustrated and done with the nonsense. 

Historically I have been in charge of logistics and planning and every f\*\*\*ing time drama happens.  They want to change the date that everyone is meeting, they can only meet here, they are busy and cannot commit (after stuff is planned and paid for).  I was expected to roll with the punches and to make things work. 

To add to this, my parent has also had a history of manipulating myself and my siblings into fights, taking money etc.  Towards the latter part of my parent's life there was pressure for me to support an ailing family member, their partner had been yelling at me/ threatening me etc.  The stress of dealing with them and other things in my life lead to my muscles becoming so tense that my teeth were starting to crack in half. My siblings are not around and either enable the behaviour or add to the chaos.  I also feel that they lack the insight needed to fully understand what the issue(s) are and their role in the dysfunction, the patterns that persist and to enact strategies to bounce back or address the dysfunction.

That Thanksgiving, I cancelled plans on my end and informed the family the kids and I were not going to go over to their place for Thanksgiving that year. Two days later they connected to my kids via their devices and asked them if they wanted to come over to their place which I am sure would of led to them asking to pick up the kids without me involved. I blocked them on my kids devices, went NC and moved on with life.

 In a nutshell, I needed space and was not given it.  

2 years later parent died. I kept no contact. I was over it.   

Throughout this ordeal I have allowed my family to have access to my kids. The boundaries I laid were simple:

\-Make plans via another family member who was neutral, not through me or my kids. Neutral family member agreed to ensure the kids can go and things are communicated. 

\-Not allowed to show up at my house (neutral pick up/drop off sites) 

\-Not allowed to contact me

\-Make plans ahead of time and have them communicated 

To further complicate matters my kids Mom has allowed contact and visits with my family on her time (we have 50/50 custody). 

***Issue*** 

My family (who I remain no contact with) want to get together to have thanksgiving.  I have no issues with the kids going over there on my time (which has been communicated to both my kids).  Again, plan ahead, communicate it and all is good. 

It is a week before Thanksgiving, and my kids want to go and are under the assumption they cannot go. Their Mom is not allowing it on her time due to family commitments on her end (which is fair).  I am flexible, but I have not heard anything from my relative that is in communication with them.  

To put it into perspective, my family has known/made plans that they are meeting at Thanksgiving for 6+ months and they do not have the where with all to make plans and to ensure that the plans are followed through.  

So now I am stuck trying to communicate to family that I want nothing to do with to ensure that my kids can visit with them.  I am aggravated and annoyed by all of this. These are grown ass adults and they are falling back into old habits expecting people to work around their inability to plan and follow through with these plans.  I am also going back to old habits of rescuing them because I want what is best for my kids.  

Shortly after Thanksgiving I plan on laying it all out for them and letting them know that I am I willing to surrender time with my kids on my weeks to ensure that they can have a relationship with my kids.  They need to plan with the neutral family member but as my son gets older and can shoulder some of this (IMO he should not have to but given the inability for my family to plan anything I am allowing it because it's important to the kids).  If they are not capable of planning ahead and respecting my boundaries around this then the chances of them being able to meet up with my kids will decrease. I will not compensate for their inability to plan ahead and to follow through with plans anymore.

 Any advice, insight or suggestions as to what to do would be helpful.  ",refuseresist,1759610115.0,3,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1ny4rkt/dealing_with_lack_of_insight_with_family_members/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1ny4rkt/dealing_with_lack_of_insight_with_family_members/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1ny4qky,Last phone call.,"So I just got a call from my Father to check up on how I am. The issue is the last call I got was back in August and it's been scarce all year since Christmas. I used to call once a week for the past two years but it's always been on my end. When we did talk, it was always of how he was doing, about his job at the time and never really asked about my family.

Anyways I kept getting asked by my wife what is something positive they've done for us since we've been settled in 2022 and I cannot give an answer. 

I told him I Love him and mom very much, knowing it was the last call. 

My question is how do I navigate this pain? Why do I feel I'm about to do something I'll regret?

1ny3q0x,"My parents keep intentionally poisoning me, and sabotaged my alarm over and over for my meds","i need my meds to survive. However, my parents, being the ones believing in conspiracy theory, insist that it’s actually harming me and meds are just “the leftist propaganda agenda“ along with “they’d rather spend it on 25kg of seafood.” i have  received permanent, UNFIXABLE EVEN BY SURGERY DAMAGE BECAUSE OF THEM AND NOW MY LIFE IS FUCKING RUINED.

  
Worst of all, they keep seeking advice from this one whatsapp group of theirs. One time they tried to force inject something into me. They are dumb and they did nothing to research how to take care of their child. One of their relative has died because of this. They refused chemo and instead ask them to eat this one random leaf they found since apparently the black in leaves cure cancer according to them.

  
They have been really dumb their entire life. My dad inherited a shit ton of wealth, and i’m saying a whole stack of gold bars and multiple buildings. However, he can still somehow bring us to borderline poverty. His siblings and other related family are all really really rich. They even gave me gold bars casually when i asked for it jokingly.

  
i hate how different they are. Others in this family are smart, rich, got their life together. But them? they’re the only special case. One time my dad even said something like “turn the electricity at night, they can’t see you and they sleep at night so the (idk what device is this, it’s the one calculating how much electricity you used. my english is kinda bad) wont go up.” They’re also racist.

1ny3i4r,"My BF’s dad is a narc, and he doesn’t realize it","I’ve only recently started seeing my bf and the more I get to know him and his family dynamic the more obvious it seems that his dad is a narcissist. 

Recently his dad lost his job “because he got screwed over” just like every job in his past as screwed him over 😒 and showed up unannounced at my BF’s place and asked him to send him 2K a month, and sell the ranch that they both have equity in (my bf pays all the bills, his dad just helped with the down payment) so his dad can have his cut of the sell. The ranch is where my bf both lives and runs his entire business out of, so this is essentially asking him to uproot his entire life. This immediatly sat weird with me and when I brought up that it is inappropriate parent behavior to expect money from your child my bf justified his dad. 

My bf is fully aware he has deep seeded mental problems, thus he does weekly therapy that has helped him tremendously with regulating his emotions….. but seems to have no idea that these episodes only happen when his dad randomly shows up. 

So I guess if anyone has any advice or has seen a similar situation I’d love some input. I do believe my bf is doing the right things by seeking help and openly communicating emotions and mental struggles…..  but I fear the longevity of our relationship may take a toll is he isn’t aware his father is the main trigger for him.

1ny3hg4,How do you make friends despite all trauma and disappointments?,"My whole life I was hated and abused by parents and I've been through hell in other areas in my life. It's like I attracted the same vile tyrant people like my parents. Everything was okay at first, but then, hell broke loose , and shortly, they become evil out of nowhere.

All my closest friends I have had were toxic boyfriends. I isolated from making further friends because I didn't relate to anyone. I have connected only to wounded people, because I felt the closest to them and they understood me the most. But after awhile, as I said, they became evil and I have a very hard time to trust new people.

I only connect to people that went through similar things I did, its normal, because I don't feel so alone anymore, and that is how I connected to others, knowing about their traumas, being vulnerable...but the downside of this was the fact that some of them laughed behind my back, and used my traumas against me or to disrespect me.

When everything I did is to give them the love, the understanding, the empathy, the friendship they never had. And still...they decided to do me dirty in the most vile manner.

How the hell am I supposed to trust again? Having no one to turn to literally destroys me and I can't take it anymore.

All I want is people like me, I want to see how its like to receive back all the rare goodness I offered to others, without expecting anything back. It genuinely makes me happy to save people, to help people. But somehow, I didn't receive it back the way I truly deserved. Its not fair. People like me deserve the best treatment, the appreciation, the love we give.

I am sick and tired of the theory that you attract what you are, because it didnt apply to me, I always attracted evil people, the same pattern.

I dont understand...how people can do such bad things to people that are literally the only good thing in their life? I would be beyond happy to have a person like myself in my life and I would do everything to keep her and appreciate her in my life...but these people just did the worst things towards me for no apparent reason with no remorse or care about my feelings. I felt like I am cursed.  
I 've always seen the most vile side of people, and I am so fed up. Empaths suffer the most, and we tend to attract the same vile psycho narcs like our parents.

We empaths only see the good in people, because we project unto others the good soul that we have, we just cant accept that some people could do bad things, because ourselves would never do it. I can't say that I was naive, maybe I was, but can you blame me? Its normal to seek outside love, the love you never received at home. We all need love. And I was attached to the good side of these people, its normal to fall in love in this case. I was only attracted to people that gave me the love and appreciation I never received, but later...its like something evil possessed them.

I believe in God , because somehow He kept me alive despite all the hell and injustice I've been through, but this loneliness and fear of people holds me back, and I really need friends, I can't go on like this. No one survives being completely alone.

Did someone come out of this suffering? Did you attract the friends you wanted despite all the unfairness and abuse you endured?

I just want to know that things will not stay this way, that someday I will have the soul tribe I wanted all my life,that will never take me for granted.

Sending hugs to you, all people that relate to me or to people that feel the same or went through similar situations. I wish we could all meet or have a group of our own to be easier to connect to good people like us, that would never do vile things to good people in their lives.",Character-Doctor786,1759607015.0,2,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1ny3hg4/how_do_you_make_friends_despite_all_trauma_and/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1ny3hg4/how_do_you_make_friends_despite_all_trauma_and/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False
1ny2qnz,My mom ruined everything in 5 years (Part 1),"This first post is only about the divorce story of my parents.

Note: This will be a really long story as all of this has happened in 5 years. So please bear with me. I am suspected of having autism, if thats relevant idk. Also English isn’t my first language. Some quotes will be slightly changed due to translation.

I (F19) have finally moved out and live with my bestfriend. Now that I no longer live with my parents I‘m starting to finally feel the reality of my last 5 years hit. I‘m starting to process everything and I really need to get this off my chest. This is a rant but I also appreciate your thoughts.

This probably started at the end of 2020. Corona had hit my country and my school closed down. At the same time my grandparents on my Dads side fell seriously ill. They where hospitalised for at least 3 months (I can’t fully remember. My memories are a bit hazy). Both of them fell into a coma and it wasn’t clear if they could make it.
My Dad wasn’t feeling well during that time, obviously. He had to handle a lot. Doctor stuff, bills, passing on information to his sister and so on. I was home all the time so I spend a lot more time with my dad. He stayed at home more, while my mom practically drowned herself in work. Besides from covid and the obvious things going on, I felt like something was wrong. 
My dad has always been open and just a chill dad, but now he seemed very quiet and tired. So one day on a car ride I asked him, what was going on. He told me, that he had found out that my Mom had been cheating on him with an (also married) coworker of hers.
Her reasoning? My dad wasn’t giving her enough love and care anymore. He only took care of his parents. And when my dad asked her if she regretted it and if she could apologise. She said that it wouldn’t help anyways.
She accused him of not caring for our family and not caring for me!! That she had to do everything. Which is just so wrong. She was at work every day from 5am to 6pm or even 8pm (5:00 till 18:00 or even 20:00) on weekends I barely saw her either. Always out somewhere. But my dad wanted to try anyway.

Cue 5 years of up and downs in their relationship. It was hell. 
In the beginning my mom wanted a divorce. Almost leaving our house with her packed bags. Almost. My dad pleaded with her to stay. That they could fix this. Tried to talk to her about how he feels and what they could do… she either stayed silent or gave passive aggressive comments. You can already tell how great the communication was.
He opened up about the mental state he was in. Her reaction was barely there. Mostly a: okayy get help.
Still it got slightly better. Until my mom broke a promise she made to my dad (no contact to that guy she cheated with). She texted her loverboy pictures from her holiday. My dad thought he should divorce her. But in the end, he said: We can fix this. Talked to her, she barely gave any answers or stared silently.
So I had to push through a lot more bullshit. I was in therapy for most of the time. 
Then December last year, my dad finally did it. He told her he wanted a divorce. (I am so proud of him. The nightmare is over. Rejoice.)
My mom balled her eyes out, saying she was sorry, that she didn’t expect it. Asked if she could get another chance. But that woman has blown so many things up, you can’t even imagine. 
Maybe I should have been happy. But honestly, I just feel dead inside. I told my dad, over and over again, that I couldn’t take it anymore. I almost never came out of my room. I didn’t want to be in my parents presence. It all felt so unstable all the time. The conversations where forced or nothing was said at all. For years. There were periods it seemed better, but as soon as I thought it was good, everything broke down again.
My Dad often talked to me about the current situation, how he found out she was cheating, who it was, how talking to my mom about it went and all that stuff. It really helped having someone to talk to and to know what was going on. But maybe it wasn’t. I don’t know, I was 15 years old. And had to act like a grown up really fast. Sometimes I think I was the most grown up person in our household.
My mom didn’t want me to know anything at all, because „it’s our relationship, not yours“. Which… idk I think sometimes it would have been better if my dad hasn’t talked to me about it as much. But what if I hadn’t known? Well, it’s too late think about that now.

But that was only the beginning. Because now the breakup process came. And oh my lord… 
January: My dad starts so think about moving to his parents again, but doesn’t want to leave me
February: My mom asks if they could try again. That all those years shouldn’t be wasted because of what she did. My dad said, he needed to think about it, and that maybe she was right.
March: My dad is starting to move his stuff to his parents house
April: Dad now lives at parents place

And then, all until July I needed to stay alone with my mom. Which is was horrible. In case it wasn’t clear: me and my mom don’t have the best relationship. At least that’s what I think about it. She probably thinks we are really close. But I will get into that in a different post. 
She used her emotional state to lash out at me. I don’t remember much of it anymore, because it was just too much. Her words hurt too much. Basically everything I did was wrong in some way. She trash talked my dad and his family. Even after i told her to stop multiple times. And then she found out my dad was dating a new woman. She started to bombard me with questions, that I didn’t want to answer. 
In the end she sat next to me, crying, telling me that she doesn’t want that woman to be a new mother for me. Or that shes worried I‘ll like her more than my own mother. 
I just looked at her and didn’t know what to say. 
I feel like I’m being ripped apart by my moms side of the family, trying to drag me to „the right side“, guilt tripping me, when I don’t call, meet my dad etc. I try to ignore it.

I met my dads new girlfriend a few weeks ago. She is amazing. 
I‘m thinking about cutting/ minimising contact with my mom.
And now I will hopefully be able to heal from the years of bad communication, miscommunication, passive aggressiveness and constant fear of losing my family. I can finally cry, without having to fear my mom hearing me and asking, what tf I‘m crying about. 
I miss my old home, i miss my old room. Mostly I miss my dad living with me. But it’s gonna be fine. Somehow.

1ny26of,"Wishing my narcissistic mom was different and that she could help with my kids, but I don’t think they know what unconditional love really means","I’m 35 weeks pregnant with my second baby and my first is 11 months old, my mom and brother wanted to go to this craft show with me today, it was on very hilly ground so I had to push my baby stroller up several hills to the different booths, well I asked my mom and brother to help because I was having contractions, they said they “physically weren’t able to push the stroller because my 11mo was too heavy” she’s only 20 pounds. So here I am 35 weeks pregnant, sweat rolling down my back as they happily walk beside me watching me struggle with pushing the stupid stroller up grassy hills. My husband’s working so I just thought it would be fun. Nope, but this has been my life since having my 11mo. Nobody can “physically” help lift her. Or emotionally handle her crying. So they say they are “there” to help, but put no effort into actually helping, like they can’t even push a stroller! Like they made all of these promises they would help with my baby, but at the end of the day, they don’t care about her and want me to handle their negative feelings about their lives. They talk over her when she cries, my mom said that I need to “live through my daughter” when she grows up? I’m struggling to raise my daughter alone with no grandparents for her in the picture. Everyday my husband and I are metaphorically pushing the stroller up hills with no help, while my family just happily walks beside us without lifting a finger. It makes me angry, resentful. But my parents never wanted to raise me, how can I expect them to want a part in my children’s lives? No one has even offered to help us with my 11mo when I go into labor, and that makes me cry because I feel so darn alone. My dad said if I can’t handle kids maybe I should just get my “tubes tied after this one” because two is the perfect number. No. I love being a mom and having kids, I just didn’t expect to not have a village to support my husband and I, I do want three or four, but I feel like I need to be prepared to do it alone and that just makes me sad",StayAtHomeMommaJam,1759603960.0,3,0.8,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1ny26of/wishing_my_narcissistic_mom_was_different_and/,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1ny26of/wishing_my_narcissistic_mom_was_different_and/,raisedbynarcissists,True,False,False,False,False,,False

1ny1itv,Narcissistic Sister,"I can't find a group for this specific issue so i thought I would start here. 

My sister is a raging narcissist, I'm constantly walking on eggshells and bending over backwards to make her happy. It's getting exhausting, and idk how much longer I can keep this up. 

I thought about cutting her off, but she is the mother of my nieces and nephew- I love these kids more than anything. Cutting her off will likely mean cutting off the kids and I can't do that. She knows they mean a lot to me, so when I offend her she completely cuts off communication until I reach out and apologize for not doing anything wrong. 

How do I navigate this, I want to be in the kids lives, but she's so controlling and overbearing idk how to see them without her.

1ny1fdj,I'm sure you'll understand,"I'm assuming I have C-PTSD, honestly, can't go to a psychiatrist because I worked on lots of my symptoms. No more panic attacks or abrupt moves to protect myself from being hit, almost no more nightmares, no more quiet voice, only loneliness and these thoughts of ending my life that come and go. 

You know, I always come back to thinking I got it under control, with new routines, a healthy lifestyle, journaling, a necessary amount of sleep, and then... bang! Here we go again. So sick and tired of it. 

I know what Pete Walker said, it happens, but gosh, I want to rebuild my life so much, while I hate myself for being not enough, although I am enough, but my mother destroyed this thought. 

So you can smell my cooking here yeah: I used to love writing, was obsessed with Tolkien, all into arts and I loved languages. My mother hated all of these things. She destroyed my poems, told me I would write my stories stuck in a dirty closet while living from paycheck to paycheck with a rubbish job. She prohibited me to speak English,  it's not my first language,  but I needed to practice it. She destroyed my handmade. 

And now with a C2 level, good artistic skills, I don't believe in myself so much, that I DO live from paycheck to paycheck. After every failure, even it was a slight one, I hate myself .  

It took me eight years to love my body and take care of it. Now the mind. It's absolutely excruciating. And she keeps on living her life, playing the victim. 

She even said my stepfather is killing her dog, and 10 years ago she accused me of killing her cat. Guess what they have? Cancer! 

I'm so sick of her voice in my head, telling me I'm a bloody loner. How do you even cope with this, guys?

1ny0z69,I am not a person. I am a collection of survival gear sewn together with scar tissue.,"The frank terms are these: I am not a person, not yet. I am the result of a catastrophic early system failure. Where others have a fused, solid core, I carry a searing, terrifying absence—a void—that is the signature of my Exile, who was told she was ""too much"" and exiled from the warmth of love.

​My entire functioning life is a collection of survival gear sewn together with scar tissue and the frantic fear of being exposed. This collection, the Managers and Firefighters of my system, is not a flaw; it is a brilliant, over-engineered suit of armor.

​The shame is not that I have no core, but that my Protector Parts—the Obedient Son, the Tirelessly Helpful Satellite, the advanced Chameleon—are so spectacularly successful at their job. They fused with the roles I was given because not fusing meant falling into the void and disappearing entirely. Their performance was not manipulation; it was a miraculous, decade-long act of self-preservation.

​The Identity Diffusion is simply the name for the extreme success of these parts. My personality, my values, my desires—they don’t snap to attention because they are missing; they salute whoever is closest because the Protector Part running the command center knows that the only way to keep the exiled, terrified child safe is to become an echo chamber for the person in front of me.

​The hell I cycle through is the realization that this system is no longer necessary, but the protectors are exhausted and terrified to step down. I am the ghost of an echo precisely because the armor has worked too well.

1ny0ykb,Family drama versus adult me,"I need to make an introduction on how life in my family goes around. I am the eldest daughter of my parents. My mom is more of a careless childish type and my dad is more neurotic, with anger issues but usually calm person. I also have a younger brother who is living with parents. My younger sister died 2 years ago because of illness.

The drama:

My parents were fighting since I was 6-9 years old. My dad would get angry at my mom and the he would give her silence treatment. Silent treatment could be from weeks to years. The longest period of time my parents didn’t talk was almost 2 years. 

I personally think my mom kind of got enjoyed to make my dad furious until the point he lashed out. 

Lashing out could include screaming, calling her (or me/my brother) offensive names. He would rarely physically abuse my mom. 

Usually after my dad got mad, the atmosphere at home was quiet but it felt like walking on eggshells because he could lash out again if my mom would try talking to him (in non-offensive/offensive) way.

The environment at home got more unstable after my sister, the 3rd child was born. 

My mom stopped working after the 2nd child was born because my dad realised he could support our family himself. His business was doing well until it wasn’. After that he was staying home a lot. When my mom got pregnant with the 3rd child, I could see she was not happy about it. 

The fights of my parents never stopped. The last peaceful moment that lasted the longest was when my sister got very sick and died shortly after. My parents got something they could share and deep sadness connected them. However, it did not last.

Some time after that they were fighting during the cemetery visit at my sister’s grave.

You will want to know why they are still together? 

My mom doesn’t want to leave the apartment where they have lived their whole life. The apartment belongs to my grandpa from my dad’s side. She has no stake in it. 

Also, I think she is too used to this lifestyle of not having to work. They are not that rich, just have enough to live a normal life. 

Their drama impacts me a lot because I am sorry for my brother as he is still living with them. 

Every time I listen to a drama unfolding my heart sinks and I go to a dark place mentally just like I did when I was younger. I don’t want to cut contact to my mother. I gave her advice that she should start relying on herself more. 

I want to know how I can be less emotional about this situations.

If you are going or went through similar experiences, please share your advice.

She didn’t just use it, she ruined it. She completely ruined my highlighter with her nasty dirty ass brush and she didn’t even clean it. 
This was after I told her MULTIPLE times not to use my make up because she’s just going to ruin it again. 
This time I snapped, I told her to stay tf away from my stuff and that I was hiding it from her because I knew this was going to happen. 
She of course started with her “respect” bullshit again, saying I had to respect her…. While she’s threatening to beat me up and insulting me. 
I snapped, I argued back, I said she wasn’t being respectful to me if she ruined my make up and threatened me. 
This made her even angrier and she kept insulting me until she raised her hand to hit me again. 
I grabbed it and threatened to hit her back. 
Before I did I slammed my door shut, packed my stuff into a little suitcase and left to go to my bf. 
While I was packing she kept insulting, threatening and belittling me.

1ny0goi,Ever had a hard time treating yourself?,"Growing up, we were poor but not so poor where we can't afford food.  My mom would limit the amount of lunch and dinner we would get growing up.  Feeling hungry almost all the time was so common, I remembered how I dealt with hunger pangs is to force myself to nap through it.  If we ask for lunch money for school (she would only allow us 1 slice of bread, folded in half, and told us that enough for the day.  Sometimes, according to her, if we're extra good, we get another slice).  This also applies to toys.  My mom refused to buy me toys.  I never asked for much as a kid, as we came from a poor country so I'm used to it.  When we moved to the States, I lost all my toys.  It was a sudden move and I wasn't allowed to bring anything but some clothes with me.  As a little girl, I loved horses although I never seen one in person.  In the States, there was a popular horse toy in Walmart.  It costs about $10-20.  That's all I wanted as a kid.  My mom would buy it and return it in a week.  I wasn't allowed to keep my toys.

As you can tell, this makes me feel like I'm not deserving of anything due to my mom.  While we were poor, we had some money, and she would spend it on yard sales to go shopping.  She even used all of the money my uncles gifted us for her shopping.  Now as an adult, I'm still struggling to treat myself, like a $16 ramen.  Yes it's a little pricey, but it's very tasty, and last I had it was a year ago.  I have to convince myself that I work hard for my money, I can very much afford it, and I'm hungry so why can't I have it.  It's like I'm arguing with myself.

1ny0cz1,Knowledge gatekeeping,"Occasional lurker.  Not sure what to call my parents, particularly my mom.  Is it typical for narcs to claim superior knowledge of an adult child‘s area of specialty?  

I have a masters in art history.  

According to my mother, she knows more than me about anything surrounding the medieval period, and my degree does not give me the right to claim historical knowledge because """"you don’t know more about history than I do, you have an art degree.“  The notion of historical context—and that we learn about history through art—seems to allude her completely.  She will insert herself into a conversation to ""correct“ me on my own field of study.

She dropped out of college and never chased a particular area of study.  She was an avid reader as a child, but doesn’t accept that historical understanding can become outdated, or that certain understandings are more commercialized (read, adopted because they’re tidy/fun) than others.

This is not a one-off.   She got into a family-rupturing fight with my sister over teaching English as a second language.  As you might have guessed, my sister teaches English as a second language.  My mom claimed to know more about her students.  
This became such a verbal blood bath that my sister—once the golden child—refuses to visit home anymore.

Heaven forbid you bring up socioeconomic issues around her…since she grew up poor, she is now the spokesperson for all poor people.  Nothing you have observed, read, or heard from other people can compare to her one personal experience growing up disadvantaged.

So, in summation, she knows more than you, and if you have a certificate/achievement/degree/lived experience suggesting that you may know more than her, no matter how niche the subject, she knows more because she spent her entire abusive childhood holed up in her room reading, your degree is college academia Kool-Aid/revisionist history, and nothing can convince her otherwise.  

We just try not to engage her.  Sometimes I get petty and ask her to go take an IQ test, which she refused to do. Yes, I know they are bullshit. She doesn’t.  But I don’t think she actually wants to confront herself image as a misunderstood genius with any sort of metric.

It seems to me like this is a manifestation of narcissism; she seems genuinely afraid to know less than somebody about something— but only within the immediate family.  

But I needed to vent, so penny for your thoughts…

1nxzq35,How do you accept that your parents don't like you?,"I've tried to tell myself to just not be emotionally attached to my father. But it's hard. I've tried cutting him off, I couldn't do it. I feel so sad that I don't have a loving family. All I wanted was to be loved and accepted for who I am. I just wanted someone to be proud of me. Instead I have a father who is critical of almost everything I do.

Sometimes, I feel like he really did try. I know that his own parents are terrible, and he tried to point me in the right direction. He made a lot of sacrifices when my mom died. That's what makes this so hard.

However, his ideas of how the world works are so unrealistic. He thinks it's impossible to go for certain careers because ""they won't pay well,"" regardless of evidence to the contrary. But he also thinks I don't have what it takes to have a ""realistic"" career. (??? What am I supposed to do) He just doesn't believe in whatever I try to do. And if I do anything outside of his worldview, he just can't accept it. He has criticized me so many times. My presence appears to annoy him.

1nxzjem,"Reported parents for behavior, opinions on it","Me(14F), brother Alex(17M), brother Mike(16M), brother Will(11M), mom(39F), stepdad(45M), sister Sue (6F), twin brothers Nick and Jacob (4M), all names will be non real names for safety and privacy reasons.

So I have for my past fourteen years of my life Indored lots of miss treatment by both my parents, but mainly my mom. But thus this year I have boiled over and can no longer keep quiet about the behaviour towards my siblings and I.

So the past 4-5 months I have been gathering the edvidce and things said towards us, to prepare a report to CFS, but during the time I was gathering it all I was analysing if it was bad or not because I didn't want to accuse them for things that have not been done. Moving on so during the past year or two(just to break it down as it would be to long doing all the fourteen years) my parents (my stepdad and mom) have been very strict and have been doing some very concerning things that I feel are not okay.

As of those years my stepdad (who is very narisctic) he has been very informative on what we have to believe regloiusly, what jobs are allowed and not, on how school is Brain rot, and how everything we eat is bad for us. So the past year I decided to recover from anorixia but during that time he was trying to get me to fast(as of not eat for 3 days) as he thought the whole illness was due to parasites, and he praised me for fasting although it was killing me, so I refused the fasting for my own safety. But that is besides the point, during the years he has been the type who yells directly in your face about how you are a screw up nearly daily but had went down as we have been very throughall with what we do so it reaches his standard. And has been separating is older four kids from the younger three as we are not his kids and he has an issue with us as we are related to our biological dad (as of which you probably made it out the younger three are probably his biological children, which is what it is). So since he has that problem with us we are limited time upstairs to visit with everyone as well as cook our food. This year he got mad at us for the garage not being cleaned to his standard and called us disrespectful although we weren't trying to, so as of that day we had all our outside gear thrown downstairs and told our clothes or shoes were never allowed in the garage again as well as leaving to go outside through the garage. Which also limited us to go to the garage fridge for our food as we can't use their food, so also at that time we had more limits to upstairs area and mainly not allowed in the kitchen, so we now had also a mini fridge and microwave moved downstairs for us to use to eat, almost forgot also had to buy our own bowls and containers. So that has been the main issue with my stepdad as well as of how he also was restricting the amount my younger siblings saw us, and how he was getting a bit to harsh for the punishments of my younger siblings that didn't match up to their ages.  Because in the past he did do the very same things in the same aspect, but this seemed a bit too far.

K moving on to my mom (she is a very manipulative somewhat narisctic).   So my mom my whole life has always had problems with me and never treated me the same as my siblings and always tricked my siblings into hating me.  But most recently I spoke up about the behaviour that wasn't okay nor safe that she and my stepdad have been doing as they have been always been beyond using us for labor on our farm for them and giving us nothing from our work, as well as making us do the work well sick and without machines when the work needs machines (as of whenever we are gone they can't do it without machines so they always end up buying them, but that rarely happens as we always do the work so we never end up getting the machines).  So I told her she was exploiting us for their needs not ours because all the work and money we get from it is used for them not us.  Personally feel I could have done it better but I was in the mits of being very done with it, but why I'm saying I could do it better is because she made it go beyond what I said.  

But throughout my whole life she sided with my stepdads actions and never listened to what we felt about it without getting really angry at us and guilt tripping us.  But also she has been a main part of the behaviours and punishments towards us.

With her most recently she has been making me struggle than once I'm struggling she tries making me talk to her and once I do and share some very valuable things she tells my siblings about it but out of contacts so it sounds as if I was being mean, so I end up have my siblings going after me or whoever else she tells.  So ever since I spoke up about all the behavior she has been using that and getting my outside family also involved in cornering me down. 

Also want to say for some other behavior besides what I shared it had gotten physical towards my younger siblings and they were showing big signs that they were getting physically hurt, and I never pointed that out to my parents for the safety of everyone, but that above all the other behavior rose big concerns to me, because I, am a very protective older sibling and when it effects my siblings I will fight for their safety no matter what.  

Also my parents were known for restricting food towards us and sending us to bed without food.  Which was happening more often.

So I reported that, so did I overexsatraing , or am I making this seem worse than reality of it, and if I made the right choice of reporting.

Going to update soon about the aftermath of me reporting it to CFS

Edit one/update. So during the time of me gathering the edvidce, I was speaking to my school counselor and opened up about this, so she ended up notifying CPS/CFS, and she ended up giving me the contact to the social worker, but at that time I was freaking out over focusing on giving clear information, so it ended up closing due to lack of facts and edvidce that could allow them to legally act opon it. So I waited I think a month or so. Than during that time I was in the middle of just leaving it alone and wanting to fight for our true safety, and at the middle of that time something came up that was very probable to me and if I told CFS,(for that information of what happened. So my younger three siblings and I were in the house, because I was watching because my parents were outside doing some stuff, but so Jacob was taking framed pictures off of walls to hang is his room, so I told him that we have to wait for mom to see if we can, but hence being three at that time he started throwing a tantrum, so I tried reassuring him that maybe we can but first we have to wait for mom. And during that he was running around with a nail so I took it so he wouldn't hurt himself on it if he fell but that escalated his tantrum so I just picked him up and sat with him and kept on telling him we have to wait and everything will be okay, and he did calm down a little. Like that sounds normal I think for most tantrums but that wasn't the thing that concerned me and proved that something wasn't right, that was just what lead to it. While that was happening and I was right about to sit down with him Nick said to me due to Jacob throwing the tantrum which made a lot of racket but he said, ""Please don't hit him, don't hit my brother"" I mean I almost broke down in tears because I knew something was up and Sue had lately being saying that mommy and daddy have been hitting me, and that sadly proved it wish it didn't have to come to that, but I knew my parents never dealt with tantrums well because whenever I was there I would be the one helping them with tantrums because I would calm them, and my parents would make it worse). So at that time I made my own report with now that and everything else, and I pulled some of their big beliefs that were dangerous to outsiders and not just us in the house. I mainly used my stepdad because he was very obvious with his behaviour and vocal, didn't have much friends due to his energy and personality, so I knew not even in our home but publicly that people had issues with him due to it, as for my mom she is like a goat at manipulation and hiding truth so I was a lot more faint with her. But thankfully that was taking seriously and they ended coming to our house and interviewing everyone.

Also want to say during the time I was gathering the edvidce although I was very secretive about my parents were suspicious with me and felt something was off, so I started getting targeted and kicked out of areas, as well as them not wanting to be by me. My mom was calling me names, trying to get me to leave places, being suspicious of my phone (although when I was around her and she was looking I was either playing a game or finding something to show her), she also told me that she was scared of me because she couldn't control me or read my mind, she was just doing everything she could to show me she didn't trust me. But idk if it was that or because a week or two before that, I was speaking up to her about her behaviour and how I disagree, and how I told her secrets don't stay secrets forever.

So after CPS/CFS came to the house my mom and stepdad were after me and Will, as they thought me and Will called when we were house-sitting for Alex, so my mom brought my grandma in and all her friends to corner us down. And I was the main suspect for them because prior to it I was speaking up about it and my disagrees on it. So the next day or so my grandma came and my mom was talking to her, and next thing I knew I was sitting on the floor with my grandma their saying why did I report, why would I do such a thing, if I care, if I knew how this could reach this family. I said I didn't because when my social worker that interviewed me told me to never tell anyone I did, so my grandma said talk to your mom and tell her so. And I mean I hid in my bathroom for a long time just to hide from everyone because I was overwhelmed and I struggle with lying about things as I'm a very honest person probably too honest at points, so I came out my mom went to guilting me, playing victim and such, and the only way I got her off of me I agreed with her so somehow convinced her maybe but than yes. Hence want to say during the whole time my grandma was over my mom was complaining about us even talking to her, everything we did was us being defent, hence I was mainly her target, but at the same time my grandma wasn't talking to me like a conversation or just in general like she normally does, she was demanding me to do things, not letting me talk, and treating me like the problem. So at that time I was feeling very isolated or trapped. I told my social worker hence because I had her contact because I reported but than she calmed most of it but till this day a lot of it is still happening but in a more secretive way so CPS/CFS could not see or pick it up.

To this very day my mom has gotten my outside family involved in the isolating tactics of me, so I have been getting emails and such from them. My mom has sided in doing this isolation on me by emotionally trapping me and making my feelings overflow so I no longer focus on her but on just fighting to get through the day. So it looks like her telling everyone I know things about me out of contacts so it sounds bad, and how I'm a wild child, so they target me on everything I do, than once that hurts me she tries building a fake relationship so she can gather more things on me to use against me. And since I have seen this before at least three times I know what she is trying to do but it doesn't make it hurt any less.

And now hence CFS/CPS is closing our file my parents are starting to go back to there old behaviours because CPS will no longer be watching. And they have been saying they will punish me after cps leaves, so right now just waiting to see what happens because CPS haven't been seeing the whole picture and have been siding with my parents because they are playing along so cps leaves, so cps has been telling me to just talk it through and to be honest the only reason that I did end up contacting cps is because I have tried talking but it doesn't work, and right now me talking isn't safe because my parents are already mad at me but can't act opon it yet, which they have stated, as well as that they said they will play along till cps leaves. So currently in a tough patch.

I guess they just don’t support the image of you giving your attention to someone else. Or what is going on? 


I knew how bad they can behave, but they showed extra craziness after I gave birth. 
It all started during pregnancy saying things like “I can’t imagine a baby in that belly. To me it looks just like a fat belly.”

A few hours after I gave birth they asked me if I still have that big belly.  And asked my husband why he looks “so lost”. 

After I got home they called me and accused us of not calling them anymore and asked me “to become the nice child I used to be”. 

During all my maternity leave they accused me of being waaay to busy for a mom and that I’m exaggerating ( only because I didn’t return their calls immediately ) .

1nxyg0z,Did you guys have any electronics as kids?,"We shared consoles until I was about 11 then gc sibling took them all. Even when we shared they would hog it most of the time. I wouldn’t dare complain or ask for things of my own. When we got older, they had better phones until we got the same ones. Also after getting older my gc siblings used to try to manipulate me into asking for things from my father because “I never asked” and they thought he would say yes to me if I asked for something once in a while like driver’s Ed or new phones. They also probably just wanted to frame me as the one asking for things so they could make it seem like it wasn’t really them, and blame me for the cost.

1nxxgys,I was raised to feel cursed. It all makes sense now.,"I had a memory come back a few days ago and it hit harder than I expected.

When I was around eight, my mother told me she had a dream/premonition that I would die of leukemia at twelve. She fully convinced me of it. I spent years believing I was going to die soon. No doctors, no tests, just her visions and prayers. When I turned twelve and obviously didn’t die, she told me it was because she had prayed it away. I was in a very dark place.

I can look at it now and see it for what it was... psychological abuse and manipulation. But back then I internalised it. I walked around as a kid believing I was doomed, defective, cursed and basically waiting for it to happen.

I’ve been no contact with her for six years now and I don’t regret that. I don’t feel love for her, I don’t feel guilt and I don’t feel the need to pretend she was anything other than harmful. She destroyed every relationship around her and never ever took responsibility. 

This is only one memory out of so many horrible ones. I've been officially diagnosed with PTSD amongst other things and everything now makes sense.

But here is the realisation that landed today. I’ve always been intimidated by emotionally healthy, stable people. Deep down I thought they wouldn’t understand me or would reject me. So I always gravitated toward broken, avoidant, insecure partners because next to them I felt safer. I felt needed. I wasn’t “too much” or “too damaged” compared to them.

Only now I can see the pattern. I picked people I could rescue because deep inside I believed I was unworthy of being chosen by someone solid. If they were also messed up, then I wasn’t the only broken person in the room. I just wanted to show them the love I never received. I wanted to protect them like I never was.

It makes sense given where I came from, but it still hurts to realise how much of my life has been shaped by wounds I never chose throughout my existence. 

I just wanted to put this somewhere people might understand. It is wild how something that happened decades ago can still run things from the background and shape my life. I still grieve and regret not having a true loving and caring mother. A kid should never go through this.

1nxwtdo,tried to be nice,"Tried to be nice yesterday and brought my father some mcdonalds because I wanted to talk things over with him. He told me he was in a rush to go play golf and that he ""didnt have time for this right now"" and even said if it wasnt an egg mcmuffin he didnt want it. Then he took the coke and demanded I leave the house at once. I was eating my food and asked if he could just let me finish and I'd lock up when I left. For context, this is my childhood home. He then said: ""How would you like it if I came over to your house and sat in your room"". And I was like: you can come over anytime I wouldnt mind, your my father.

1nxw7xh,Anyone grayrocked by a sibling their WHOLE life?,"My brother (GoldenChild) hasn't been on speaking terms with me for about 20 years, which was awkward because we lived together and had to take part in family events for 18 years. Still stuck living with my parent, so we see him & his family about 10 times a year, and I'm completely ignored by his whole family & the dozens of guests that come to the functions. We babysit his kids 2 weekends a month (because I'm living with my parent at the moment )and I can't even get eye contact, a hello or a thank you. Just brushes past me rudely to talk to my mom. The guy is 36 and I'm 29. We lived together until I was 18 and I was kicked out and I was never humanised throughout my entire childhood, through vacations, holidays, birthdays, anything.

Just never looks at me, never spoke, responded, completely ignored me. Of course they only time I'm mentioned by him is when the family is making fun of me.

I hear people being greyrocked later in life but has anyone lived with a sibling that refuses to acknowledge you in any capacity, EVER?

1nxw532,Is it ever worth trying to “figure out” their gaslighting?,"In situations with multiple manipulators — is it ever worth spending the time to figure out the meaning of their cryptic posts, lies, exaggerations etc. 

Or is it just worth noting “ok that person is manipulative” then leave it at that?

Because it seems like they just keep you going around in circles and confuse you just so you waste your time trying to figure out the “truth” when really it’s probably better just to completely abandon the whole situation!

1nxvzvb,Abusive & Narcissistic Mother,"This is an incredibly difficult thing to share, but I'm feeling completely powerless and desperate for advice right now. My family is in the middle of a deeply unfair and scary legal situation involving my abusive mother, and I don't know what to do next.

My mom's behavior has escalated recentlyincluding instances of violence, raising a knife, and threatening my dad in the kitchen. My dad finally went to the police to report the abuse. While he was at the station, my mom was spying on a call he made to my sister and me. She immediately went down there herself, lodged a complaint against him, and the police believed her.

That was the start of an Intervention Order (IO) against my dad.

We went to Magistrates Court, where the judge adjourned the main hearing until December. They put an interim IO in place, barring my dad from coming within 200m of my mother.

Crucially, the judge agreed that my sister and I should stay in the family home.

Over the past months, I’ve found evidence of my mom's alcohol and drug use (weed) around the house, which directly correlates with her aggressive and violent outbursts. I was too scared to tell the court, but when I've confronted her, she's become violent.

Although my sister and I are not included in the IO, my mom's bullying, physical abuse, and aggressive behavior have effectively forced us out of the house.

Her abusive extended family recently showed up at the family house, explicitly against the judge's wishes, and tried to use legal loopholes to kick us out. This feels like deliberate, forceful displacement.
My dad has been displaced, and now my sister and I are, too. I feel like the system has completely failed us by believing her false claims, and her controlling, violent behavior has only been enabled by this 

We are out of the house now. What are the most important steps we can take to stay safe and legally document everything (drug/alcohol evidence, the family showing up against the judge's wishes, her past violence, and our forced displacement)?

Given the adjournment until December, how can I best prepare for the main IO hearing? I now want to come forward about her alcohol/drug use and past violence. How do I make sure the court hears the truth about her being the abuser?

I do need my school supplies but ultimately, I want her out of the family house. 

Could my sister and I file for an Intervention Order against her based on her physical abuse and forced displacement, and would this help our dad's case?

Any advice, especially from people who have navigated false IOs or similar family court situations, would be deeply appreciated. We just want the truth to be heard and to be safe.
